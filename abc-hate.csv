http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/sex-video-korea-accused-targeting-gay-soldiers-46930195,"A watchdog group says South Korea's army is hunting down and prosecuting gay servicemen after a video of two male soldiers having sex was posted on the internet earlier this year, stoking fear in an already persecuted minority group.

Military investigators looking into the case have threatened soldiers to out their gay peers, confiscated cellphones to check communication records, and even used dating apps to dupe soldiers into revealing their sexual identity, said Lim Tae-hoon, the head of the Military Human Rights Center for Korea, which tracks down abuses in the armed forces.

South Korea's army says it's conducting a proper criminal investigation into soldiers allegedly involved with filming and uploading the video, which is a violation of the country's communications laws and a military penal code that makes homosexual activity punishable by up to two years in prison. The army has denied allegations that investigators are using the case to embark on a broader mission to weed out gay soldiers.

""Military investigators used the information they gained from the investigation on the sex video to track down other gay soldiers in the army, starting by forcing the suspects to identify who they had sex with and then widening their search from there,"" said Lim, who said a soldier tipped his group off about the alleged crackdown.

In conservative South Korea, gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people are harshly stigmatized and struggle to be politically visible, while a powerful Christian lobby immobilizes politicians seeking to pass anti-discrimination laws. That stigma is amplified in the military, where most able-bodied South Korean men are required to serve about two years as the country maintains a large force in the face of potential conflict with North Korea.

Gay men are not exempt from conscription but are banned from engaging in homosexual activity while serving, leading to an environment in which they serve without revealing their sexual identity for fear of discrimination and reprisals.

""South Korea's military doesn't exclude gay men from compulsory duty, but once they enter the military, they are seen as dangerous and treated as potential criminals, as the ongoing army investigation shows,"" said Han Ga-ram, an openly gay human rights lawyer.

He said the investigation had ""touched off fear in the LGBT community.""

""Hate crimes against LGBT people are already a serious problem, and the government could make it worse by sending the wrong message by punishing gay men in the military,"" Han said.

The army doesn't reveal information about how often it pursues cases against gay soldiers, but Lim said in the five years before 2017 he knows of only two cases where soldiers were prosecuted for homosexual activity. Since the start of the year, more than 30 soldiers have come under investigation and one has been arrested, an army captain who did not know the soldiers involved, Lim said.

""The soldiers who are being investigated had sex with their partners under mutual consent and not inside the barracks,"" Lim said. ""The army has infringed on the realms of privacy and is falsely claiming that these soldiers committed wrongdoings.""

Lim said the arrested captain had never met the soldier who uploaded the video and he was arrested for allegedly obstructing the investigation by delaying his appearance for questioning due to his lawyer's schedule. The captain's lawyer could not be reached for comment.

Lim's group in 2014 uncovered the bullying death of a 21-year-old army conscript, a case that shocked the nation and led to calls for the Defense Ministry to take serious steps to reduce bullying and hazing in the military.

The army didn't provide details of its investigation into the video, including the number of soldiers being investigated or why the captain was arrested. It said in a statement that the investigation was proceeding legally and that the privacy of soldiers was being protected.

The army also stressed that homosexual activity in the military is banned to allow soldiers to maintain ""sound and healthy private lives.""

""The army will continue to deal with activities that disrupt the discipline of troops based on related laws,"" the army said in a statement.

South Korea's stance runs counter to that of the United States, which maintains bases in the country and is its largest ally. In 2011, the U.S. repealed its policy, known as don't ask, don't tell, which banned open homosexuality in the military.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/suspect-fresno-shooting-rampage-charged-previous-murder-motel/story?id=46925155,"The suspect behind a shooting rampage that killed three people in just minutes in Fresno, California Tuesday has been charged with murder from a previous killing.

The Fresno County District Attorney's Office charged Kori Ali Muhammad in last week's murder of 25-year-old Carl Williams, a security guard at a local Motel 6. Muhammad told investigators that he shot Williams because he disrespected him, Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said Wednesday. He is also charged with attempted murder for shooting at a second security guard.

Muhammad -- born Kori McDonald -- will be arraigned Friday morning on that murder charge. The district attorney has not yet submitted its case on the this week's shooting spree.

Police said Muhammad was inspired to carry out the ""hate crime"" shooting after learning on a local news report that he was the suspect of the Motel 6 murder.

Muhammad told police that he is Muslim but had't been to a mosque in 20 years and prays to numerous gods and practices voodoo rituals.

On Tuesday morning, he had gone to buy items to practice voodoo but stopped at a Starbucks instead, where he used the wi-fi to watch a news broadcast from ABC Fresno station KFSN, which identified him as the suspect in Williams' murder.

He then decided to kill as many white males as possible, Dyer said, adding that he Muhammad told investigators that he does not like white men. Muhammad has also written anti-government sentiments on social media as well as posts saying that he does not like white people, the police chief said.

John Walker/Fresno Bee via AP

Muhammad fired 17 shots in about three minutes, killing three people. He also fired at two women inside of a car and at a group of men at a bus stop.

Muhammad was arrested shortly after the shooting and has since given detectives several hours of interviews describing his actions, laughing while he made the descriptions, Dyer said.

Dyer said that officers witnessed Muhammad yell ""Allahu akbar"" at the scene of the shooting. Dyer described Muhammad as a ""racist"" rather than a terrorist.

The shooting was labeled by police as a hate crime. It is unclear if Muhammad has retained an attorney.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/church-pastor-killed-blasts-political-ad-46922111,"The pastor of a South Carolina church where nine black members were killed in a racist attack said Thursday that a political ad calling politicians weak and panicked for taking down the Confederate flag after the massacre was distasteful.

""The events of a racist committing murder is something that never should be utilized to advance someone's political career,"" Emanuel AME Pastor Eric Manning said.

Sheri Few, a Republican running for an open U.S. house seat in the northern part of South Carolina, released the ad on the internet Wednesday. In it, she stands in front of an American flag with a semi-automatic assault weapon.

""Weak politicians are too quick to blame a horrible tragedy on a flag, or a gun or even free speech. And that's how bad laws are made,"" Few said in the ad.

Manning said Few needs to remove the ad immediately.

""We lived the events of June 17, 2015, and now someone wants to utilize our pain for their political gain. There's just no call for that. I think it is distasteful, to be very candid and direct,"" Manning said.

Few is one of seven candidates running for the GOP nomination to replace Republican Mick Mulvaney, who left the U.S. House earlier this year to become director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Few said the ad will start running this weekend on cable channels in the district centered south of Charlotte, North Carolina.

Dylann Roof entered Emanuel AME and sat through Wednesday night Bible study for 45 minutes before opening fire during the closing prayer. He has been sentenced to death by a jury who found him guilty of federal hate crimes.

Few pointed out she never mentions the church specifically in her ad.

""I am a Christian. I love those people,"" Few said. ""That's why I support the death penalty for that sick, deranged man. And I hope a liberal judge doesn't get in the way.""

5:45 p.m.

The man suspected of killing three white men in a racially motivated attack in Fresno says he joined a gang in Sacramento when he was 9 and got involved with the black liberation movement at 14.

Kori Muhammad talked about his upbringing in a video interview published in 2015 on the website of Community Media Access Collaborative, where he was part of a media training program.

He says he joined the Nation of Islam and in 1995, when he was 17, he attended the Million Man March in D.C. as a lieutenant.

He says Martin Luther King ""wanted to hug their hands, and get along with them, and lick their feet and they still killed him.""

———

5 p.m.

The man suspected of killing three white men in a racially motivated attack in Fresno has a criminal history with arrests starting when he was 13.

Kori Ali Muhammad's criminal history includes arrests for gun possession, theft and drug charges. Records show he was arrested at least twice as a teen for possessing a gun in school.

Court records show Muhammad also was arrested in Washington state in 2004 after acknowledging he shot a gun outside his apartment.

Prosecutors said he left the state and the case was later dismissed after they declined to extradite him from a federal prison.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons says Muhammad was incarcerated at a federal penitentiary from October 2006 to September 2011 after being convicted of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute.

4:40 p.m.

The roommate of one of the victims of a racially motivated rampage in Fresno says they were waiting for a bus home when the shooter opened fire.

Mark Greer said he and 58-year-old David Jackson stopped at the Catholic Charities building after running a bank errand because Greer needed to use the restroom.

The two were waiting for the bus when authorities say Kori Ali Muhammad, who is black, targeted the white men at random. Greer said he ran into the Catholic Charities building.

Greer says they would shop for groceries and cleaned the house together. On the first of every month, Greer said Jackson would treat him to a meal at Denny's restaurant where they both ordered the club sandwich.

Greer says Jackson was a military veteran.

2:15 p.m.

Authorities says a suspect in a shooting that left three white men dead in Fresno continued shooting one victim on the ground.

Police Chief Jerry Dyer said Wednesday that the carnage began as Kori Ali Muhammad killed a security guard at a motel Thursday. Police said Muhammad spent the weekend in a ravine, and after learning he was wanted by police, set out to kill Tuesday.

Dyer says Muhammad, who is black, noticed a white man in a utility truck and fired into it, killing Zackary Randalls. He also shot Mark Gassett on a sidewalk, then pumped two more rounds into him as he lay wounded.

Finally, Dyer said Muhammad fired in the direction of a bus stop where he spotted three white men. They scattered, and the gunman picked an ""older gentleman"" who appeared to be heavier, David Jackson, and shot him twice.

1:45 p.m.

Authorities say a man picked up the gun that a suspect used to kill three white men in a racially charged attack in Fresno and are urging him to turn himself in.

Police Chief Jerry Dyer also told reporters Wednesday that it's ""very rare"" for a homicide suspect to cooperate with investigators in recounting the killings. Dyer says he believes Kori Ali Muhammad, who is black, was ""proud"" of what he did.

Muhammad yelled ""Allahu akbar,"" or ""God is great,"" during his arrest and described himself as Muslim but says he practiced voodoo rituals and prays to seven different gods.

Dyer says Muhammad isn't a terrorist but is a racist and described the slayings as a hate crime.

———

1:35 p.m.

Authorities say the man suspected of killing three white men in a racially charged attack in Fresno laughed multiple times as he recounted the rampage to detectives.

Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer told reporters Wednesday that Kori Ali Muhammad spoke about the killings in a callous way as he went with officers to the Motel 6 where he is accused of killing a security guard, and back to the scene of Tuesday's three killings.

Dyer says Muhammad told police that he gave himself up because he respects Fresno officers, didn't want them to shoot him and is not a ""coward.""

The police chief says Muhammad hasn't shown any remorse other than saying sorry to Dyer during his arrest.

———

1:30 p.m.

Authorities say the man suspected of killing three white men in a racially charged attack in Fresno told police he was ""not going to go down for shooting a security guard.""

Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said Wednesday that after Kori Ali Muhammad knew he was wanted for the security guard's death, he wanted to take out as many white men as possible. He told investigators that he did not like white men and that ""white people were responsible for keeping the black people down.""

He told investigators that he hid out in a ravine and practiced voodoo rituals after the Motel 6 slayings. He also told investigators he is Muslim, but he prays to seven different gods and hasn't been to a mosque in 25 years.

1:20 p.m.

Authorities say the man suspected of killing three white men in a racially charged attack in Fresno says he killed a motel security guard days earlier because the guard disrespected him.

Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer says suspect Kori Ali Muhammad spent hours talking with investigators after his arrest.

Dyer says Muhammad went with officers to the Motel 6, where he is accused of killing unarmed security guard Carl Williams. Muhammad had gone there to meet a woman, and he argued with security who asked him to leave.

Dyer says Muhammad fired at Williams, intending to kill him, because he felt Williams disrespected him.

The suspect then fled and hid on a gas station roof. Dyer says he watched detectives investigate, then left and hid by a dumpster.

12:25 p.m.

The mother of a man killed at a Fresno motel days before the same suspect was accused of a shooting rampage says she's grateful she told her son she loved him before he died.

Authorities say Carl Williams was working as a security guard at a Motel 6 on Thursday night when Kori Ali Muhammad shot and killed him after an altercation. Police say Williams was unarmed.

Francine Williams described her 25-year-old son as a kind and giving person who had recently gotten engaged.

She saw her son a few days before he died and spontaneously told him she loved him and was proud of him. Carl Williams told her he loved her, too.

Muhammad, who's black, was arrested Tuesday after police say he killed three other white men at random.

A close friend of a man who was shot in the passenger seat of a utility truck during a deadly rampage in Fresno says the victim was a 34-year-old father of two young children.

Eddie Valencia said Wednesday that he and Zackary Randalls were friends for 15 years after bonding on a job over a love of music and the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Randalls was in a training program for Pacific Gas & Electric and doing a ride-along Tuesday when he was gunned down. The driver wasn't hit and sped toward the police department, but Randalls died.

Two others also were shot and killed. Police arrested Kori Ali Muhammad, who is black, saying he singled out white victims and killed them at random.

Valencia called Randalls ""one of the wittiest people he's ever known,"" saying the two loved to laugh.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/fresno-police-chief-releases-details-hate-crime-shooting/story?id=46884877,"Police in Fresno, California revealed new details today on the ""hate crime"" shooting that killed three people in just minutes on Tuesday morning and what allegedly inspired the suspect to commit the murders.

Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said in a press conference Wednesday that suspect Kori Ali Muhammad -- born Kori McDonald -- was inspired to carry out the attack after learning on local news that he was the suspect of another murder at a local motel.

That's when Muhammad -- armed with a revolver -- decided that he was going to kill as many white males as possible, Dyer said, adding that the Muhammad told investigators that he did not like white men. Muhammad has also written anti-government sentiments on social media as well as posts saying that he does not like white people, the police chief said Tuesday.

Around 10:45 a.m. Tuesday, Muhammad fired 17 shots in about three minutes, Dyer said.

During the shooting rampage, Muhammad fired several times at two Hispanic women in a car, but he stopped shooting once he realized they were Hispanic and let them go, Dyer said. Muhammad also fired at a group of men at a bus stop and chased after one man, who was the heaviest and oldest of the group. That man became his final victim, Dyer said.

Muhammad was arrested shortly after the shooting and has since given detectives several hours of interviews describing his actions, Dyer said. The suspect lead detectives through the murder scenes and explained to investigators what he did and why, laughing while he made the descriptions, Dyer said.

Fresno Police via AP

Muhammad was already wanted for allegedly murdering a Motel 6 security guard who was identified by Dyer today as 25-year-old Carl Williams. The murder occurred last week, Dyer said.

Muhammad fired at Williams because he said the security guard disrespected him, Dyer said.

Muhammad led investigators through the crime scene at the motel as well as the locations from yesterday's shootings, Dyer said.

Muhammad told detectives that he is Muslim but hadn't been to mosque in 20 years and prays to numerous gods, Dyer said. The suspect also said that he had been practicing voodoo rituals and is not a terrorist or affiliated with any terror groups.

Dyer said that officers witnessed Muhammad yell ""Allahu akbar"" at the scene of the shooting. Dyer described Muhammad as a ""racist"" rather than a terrorist.

On Tuesday morning, Muhammad had gone to buy items to practice voodoo rituals when he went to Starbucks instead, Dyer said. While there, he used Stabucks' Wi-Fi to watch a broadcast from ABC Fresno station KFSN, which identified him as a suspect in Williams' murder.

Police were alerted to the scene Tuesday through ShotSpotter, a gunfire locator that detected multiple gunshots in the same vicinity, Dyer said Tuesday. Dyer played audio of the shots fired recorded by ShotSpotter during today's press conference.

Fresno Bee via AP Photo

Muhammad did not run from Fresno police officers because he said he respected them, according to the police chief. Muhammad said he didn't want police to be forced to shoot him and that he is not a coward.

Once he saw the officers on the scene, Muhammad got on the ground, Dyer said Tuesday.

Dyer identified the victims of yesterday's shooting, which included 37-year-old Mark Gassett, 58-year-old David Jackson and 34-year-old Pacific Gas and Electric Company worker Zachary Randalls. Dyer showed pictures of Randalls' family photos with his children after identifying him.

Randalls was driven to police in a PG&E truck, Dyer said Tuesday.

It is unclear if McDonald has entered a plea or retained an attorney.

The gun has not been located after it was wrapped in clothing and picked up by someone on the scene, Dyer said, describing the man who took it as Hispanic.

Dyer asked for the man who took the gun to turn himself in immediately. The man fled from the scene after taking the gun, the police chief said.

Muhammad spoke to his mother Tuesday night after he was arrested, Dyer said.

During the rampage, Muhammad shot at a resident who he encountered in the neighborhood multiple times but missed, Dyer said Tuesday. He then shot and killed the man he encountered next.

Muhammad dropped shell casings and reloaded his gun before setting of to Catholic Charities on North Fulton Street in Fresno, where he shot and killed a man he encountered in the parking lot, Dyer said Tuesday.

Aaron Van Curen, who lives near Catholic Charities, said he didn't believe what he was witnessing when he heard multiple gunshots. Gassett was killed near his home, Van Curen said. Once he saw that the shooter had left the scene, he went outside to feel for a pulse, and ""there wasn't one,"" he said.

""He was obviously dead at that point..."" Van Curen said, adding that he then waited for police to arrive.

Dyer said Tuesday night that he did not believe the murders were related to terrorism and that the shootings were ""solely based on race.""",abcnews.com,True

The suspect recording on his phone as he shot and killed an elderly man right on the street. The case is raising all sorts of questions about crime in the era of social media. Looks like there's one guy down in the white car. Reporter: The two-day nationwide manhunt for 37-year-old murder suspect Steve Stevens is finally over after he took his own life late this money. This started with one tragedy and ended with another person taking their own life. Loss of life is loss of life. We would like to have brought Steven peacefully and really talked to him to find out exactly why this happened. I'm at the point where I snapped. Reporter: Stevens on the run after posting this chilling video to his Facebook page on Easter Sunday. Find me somebody I'm going to kill, kill this guy right here, old dude. Reporter: He recorded himself randomly killing 74-year-old Robert Godwin senior in cold blood on a sidewalk in Cleveland. How old are you? Oh, man -- look -- Reporter: 911 calls from a neighbor witness described the chaotic aftermath. Where was he shot at? He's been shot in the head. Is he awake at all? No, I don't -- he's unconscious, he's dead. Reporter: Police made phone contact with Stevens Sunday but weren't able to convince him to turn himself in. Stevens' trail went cold shortly thereafter, leaving much of the country on edge. This individual is armed and dangerous and at this point heck be a lot of places. Cases like this where there's a national search and leads have dried up, the public is part of solving the crime. Reporter: The key to finding Stevens today, a call to 911 from drive-through employees at a McDonald's in Erie, Pennsylvania, where Stevens' cell phone had pinged a tower on Sunday. Came through drive-through, placed an order, got to the first window where he paid. The drive-through employee that was working at the time recognized him or thought -- noticed that the car was Ohio tags and it was a white fusion. And took his money and he pulled to the next window. Meanwhile she stepped out of there and called the state police right away. Reporter: Employees then asked Stevens to wait for his fries, which they deliberately held back in order to give law enforcement time to arrive. He didn't want to wait for the fries which was fine. But he took his six-piece, didn't want any money back, and headed out onto Buffalo road. The minute he turned right on Buffalo road, the state police right behind him at that point. Losing him wasn't an option at this point, there was too much at stake. Reporter: A short pursuit followed with Pennsylvania state troopers bringing Stevens' car to a stop. At that time Stevens used a handgun to take his own life. Reporter: For the family of the victim, a grandfather of 14, Stevens' death offers little comfort. It still ain't making me feel no better because he took himself out like a coward. No closure for me and my babies. Reporter: This senseless killing raises real questions about the role and responsibility of social media in potentially glorifying acts of violence. This is something that should not have been shared around the world. Period. Reporter: Stevens' graphic video remained on his Facebook page for more than two hours, viewed by more than 1,000 people, before his account was disabled. Today the CEO of Facebook, mark Zuckerberg, acknowledged his company needs to do better. Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Robert Godwin senior. We will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening. Reporter: Stevens' murder video was part of a series of rants he posted on his Facebook page Sunday morning. I deal with problems every day but when it comes to my Nobody gives a . Reporter: He came he was on a killing spree. I killed 13, working on 14 as we speak. I'm running around hating , man. I just snapped, man. Reporter: Stevens is not the first to post himself committing a violent crime on social media. Earlier this year, aacebook live video in Chicago captured the beating of an 18-year-old with special needs for nearly 30 minutes. In that case, Facebook removed the video and the four suspects were charged with committing a hate crime, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, and aggravated battery. We got a busted taillight in the back -- Reporter: Last summer a Facebook live video of philando Castille dying after being shot by a police officer while disturbing, also cast a powerful spotlight on police traffic stops and racial justice. He just shot his arm off. Reporter: Ska steel's girlfriend, diamond Reynolds, kept streaming, providing possible evidence in upcoming trial of the officer who pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter. He's licensed to carry. He was trying to get out his I.D. And his wallet out of his pocket. I chose to allow the video to go live ten seconds before my phone died, because I wanted everybody in the world to see what the police do and how they roll and it's not right. Reporter: In response to the Steve Stevens video Facebook said they are reviewing their reporting flows to be sure people can report videos and other material that violates our standards as easily and quickly as possible. And that they're constantly exploring ways that new technologies can make them sure that Facebook is a safe environment, including artificial intelligence. A couple of minutes on the internet now of a video can go viral, because it can be copied and shared widely in a number of different places. So these companies have a real reason to want to make sure it's not there in the first place. Reporter: Brian Godwin, grandson of Steve Stevens' victim, pleaded with people on Twitter to stop spreading the horrific video saying, please, please, please stop retweeting that individvideo and report anyone who has posted it, that is my grandfather, show some respect. That plea a reminder just as law enforcement relied on the public to report any information about Stevens' whereabouts, so too do social media companies rely on users to spot trouble online. We rely on the public to report and to participate in ensuring that our communities are safe. So we want to encourage people who are interacting on Facebook to report inappropriate conduct. Reporter: Tonight, law enforcement continues its investigation into Steve Stevens, who worked at a facility that helps troubled youth. The person that I knew 15 years ago, I could not imagine killing someone for any other reason other than like in self-defense or something like that. Reporter: He had documented happier times on his YouTube account over the past year and a half, including bowling, fishing, the championship victory of his hometown Cleveland cavaliers. We did it, baby, number one! A Normal, average guy. Graduated from school. Had stable employment. This is a surprise. Reporter: So far, the claims Stevens made about killing several other people have not been verified by law enforcement. Meanwhile, Robert Godwin's friends and family are paying tribute to him, telling my colleague ABC's Alex Perez -- It's my dad's invoice. Reporter: That they are heartbroken over their loss. He'd give you the shirt off his back. Just to know that I will never, ever hear my father's voice again. Devastating. You can't get any wronger than taking somebody's life. But my dad would be the kind of person that would say, you've got to forgive. You've got to forgive. Next here on a different

Officers witnessed him yell ""Allah Akbar,"" Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said Tuesday afternoon, adding that he has written anti-government sentiments on social media as well as posts saying that he does not like white people. The murdered victims were white males.

Later in the day, at a press conference Tuesday night, Dyer said he did not believe the murders were related to terrorism, adding that the shootings were ""solely based on race,"" deeming it a hate crime.

Around 10:45 a.m. local time, police officers with the Fresno Police Department responded to a scene after two gunshots were detected through ShotSpotter, a gunfire locator, according to Dyer. Several more gunshots were detected nearby, Dyer said.

A total of 16 rounds were fired in less than a minute in four different locations, Dyer said.

One of the shooting victims was driven to police in a Pacific Gas and Electric Company truck, Dyer said. That shooting was ""unprovoked,"" Dyer said.

The suspect then encountered a resident in the neighborhood, who he shot at multiple times but missed, Dyer said. After that, he encountered another man, who he shot and killed, Dyer said.

The suspect, who was armed with a revolver, then dropped shell casings and reloaded his gun before he set off to Catholic Charities on North Fulton Street in Fresno, Dyer said. There, he encountered a man in the parking lot and killed him, Dyer said.

Officers responding to the scene saw a black man running, who got on the ground once he saw the officers, Dyer said.

Police identified the suspect as Kori Ali Muhammad -- born Kori McDonald -- who was already wanted for an alleged murder of a security guard at Motel 6 on Thursday.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/target-online-trolls-suing-neo-nazi-websites-publisher-46863222,"A Montana real estate agent sued the founder of a neo-Nazi website on Tuesday, saying the publisher orchestrated an anti-Semitic ""campaign of terror"" that bombarded the woman and her family with hateful messages from anonymous internet trolls.

The barrage of emails, phone calls, texts and social media comments threatened and harassed Tanya Gersh and her family — including her 12-year-old son — with messages replete with slurs and Holocaust references, according to the federal lawsuit.

The trolling campaign started in December after Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin published the family's personal information, including the 12-year-old's Twitter handle and photo. In a string of posts, Anglin accused Gersh and other Jewish residents of Whitefish, Montana, of engaging in an ""extortion racket"" against the mother of white nationalist Richard Spencer.

Gersh's lawsuit said she agreed to help Spencer's mother sell commercial property she owns in Whitefish amid talk of a protest outside the building. Sherry Spencer, however, later accused Gersh of threatening and harassing her into agreeing to sell the property.

Gersh, 44, told The Associated Press that she has been so scared for her family's safety that she packed a bag and left it on her bedroom floor for three months in case they decided to flee their home.

""I've never experienced that kind of fear in my life,"" she said.

Gersh is represented by the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. Her suit accuses Anglin of invading her privacy, intentionally inflicting ""emotional distress"" and violating a Montana anti-intimidation law.

The mother of two young sons said she suffers panic attacks, goes to bed in tears and wakes up crying. She also said her real estate business suffered because she had to take down her website and is too afraid to answer the phone.

Her suit, filed in Missoula, Montana, seeks unspecified damages against Anglin, who didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Law center president Richard Cohen, one of Gersh's attorneys, said the case could be a blueprint for fighting a digital strain of white supremacy.

""In the old days, they would have burned a cross on Tanya's front lawn. Now, in the digital age, they launch a troll storm,"" Cohen said.

The Alabama-based law center filed a similar suit in 1998 against a white supremacist who threatened Bonnie Jouhari, a fair housing specialist in Pennsylvania. Jouhari fled with her daughter and moved to another state after her tormenter posted her address and photo on the internet and branded her a ""race traitor"" for her work.

But cases like these are very rare because many victims are too scared to sue or can't afford a lawyer, said Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor and author of the book ""Hate Crimes in Cyberspace.""

""We don't have a lot of precedent with provocateurs like Andrew Anglin,"" Citron said.

Anglin uses a mailing address in Worthington, Ohio, for his website, which takes its name from Der St?rmer, a newspaper that published Nazi propaganda. The site includes sections called ""Jewish Problem"" and ""Race War.""

The Daily Stormer's trolling targets have included prominent journalists, a Jewish congressional candidate in California, a British Parliament member and Alex Jones, a radio host and conspiracy theorist whom Anglin derided as a ""Zionist Millionaire.""

Anglin's Dec. 16 article about Gersh urged readers to ""take action"" against her and other Jewish residents of Whitefish, posting their telephone numbers, email addresses and Twitter handles.

""And hey - if you're in the area, maybe you should stop by and tell her in person what you think of her actions,"" he added.

Richard Spencer has popularized the term ""alt-right"" to describe a fringe movement loosely mixing racism, anti-Semitism, white nationalism and anti-immigration. Spencer and Anglin have appeared on a podcast together and are both leading figures in the alt-right movement.

After Donald Trump's election, Spencer hosted a conference in Washington that ended with audience members mimicking Nazi salutes after Spencer shouted, ""Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!""

According to the lawsuit, Whitefish residents' ""discontent with the Spencer family had been simmering for years and reached a fever pitch when the 'Hail Trump' video of Richard Spencer went viral.""

Gersh fears her lawsuit will stir up another round of threats, but she said she is suing because the campaign against her family went ""far beyond harassment."" She and her husband, Judah, felt compelled to teach their sons about the Holocaust after the trolling started.

""Our dinner conversations at home now regularly include that they shouldn't be in fear for being Jewish,"" she said.",abcnews.com,True

Hey what's up everybody welcome to uncut after all. The goal here is to have honest unflinching conversations about the issues that seem to divide us as Americans. I am from the united each week in the feature one on one interview with special guest to learn more not only about what they believe but why they believe when they do. With me today. Ari carnival. And congress can they weren't very embarrassing Reza Maine yes do it. Queens there is Brooklyn aids and median those of multiple podcasts including politically active my you have been seen on any number of late night comedy shows. Letterman Conan and Jimmy Kimmel you had your special on Comedy Central it. People basically come into contact with viewing at work any number of accurate. Yeah and that's embarrassing announcement that feels really good. And it's your. I want to talk TO. Because a lot of your work focuses on rates not all of it. But a lot and you especially over the last year for when the first people who really started to talk about it. In a political context. We seem to resonate with a lot of people wanted to understand more about. You again you grew up. And how that came I think they wanted to talk about it let's tell me about. Are pretty go out. Well for well I think it's funny fizzled district eleven talking about the stuff forever in them and now all the sudden it it. To allow more people it's become relevant bits and I'm just counseled on the same stuff or it owns the same. Ideas and now I think it's there's just so much so many more ideas that people are exposed to weather through the Internet or or because you know if you the president. That says summing ants Islam phobic or sexist all the sudden it's easier to give an example because the president of the United States that it puts them. It's a good it's an integrated newspaper. And he's a human on palate I. This happen island an of the story yet how this happened in honor the story of heart. I grew up in Queens New York my father. As a go cart event technician. And Flushing Hospital my mother runs past lab at long island Jewish hospital she was a doctored India and fortunately she can be doctors here it is raising two kids. From. And they emigrated here when they were adults and yes my father first and my mother asked there both my brother and I am a rather show. Would later be the height man the rap group das racist views later. We grew up in that in Queens first and Jackson Heights and Floral Park near the border of long albums make sure it's clear it's. It's as alignments there is a very clear line there. And and in and in Jamaica queens. Went to Townsend Harris high school is where the high school mascot named after main pollutants that if they get three strangest year after year Harry the hawk HA yes that's OK my senior year. High school sophomore had. Raise money to make a mascot can you whatever he wanted and shows me because I did comedy I was really active public school but it wasn't. John assault went toward schools with some really lay. There are other options clearly happy and salt the Hulk is is closer it's coding. And a necklace but they went with Larry a ha how you about. It's real ethical legacy but it it. It feels like Iceland and lived up some and that happened in high schools including immediately as I've done I've had a nice career but I still haven't. John assault again that's that's a hell of a standard. That is what's driving this thing is that just kind of math that yeah definitely have to your career on the line right here credit that. So were you always this way we did you only about things the way that you think about the now as a kid to. No I mean I think a sense of justice and fairness and sensitivity and like that was always there and I think eyewitness with at this from the way your folks raised my mom and am I am I think I'm. Mom and dad very a very different people I think a lot of those characteristics come from my mom and so is. Sensitive buffalo chips quick and especially you know I think. Being. You know she was that she was a doctor and India and her small town in utter. You know in her twenties in future accomplished a great deal and also she lost everything came to this country has to be a housewife which was not the plan and I think when you deal with lots of things a lot of loss losing family and your over here all the stuff. You know I think sense of humor becomes so crucial and I saw how my mom was able. Often collapse awful lot of painful awful things that's yet to deal with. And I think that's a lot of a lot of votes in and I think seeing how my mom had to cope with. The frustrating things in her life and how she was able to finish is a very dark sense of humor. I think that instilled that in me and my brother in and my brother maverick clothes so at that we have this mother who kind of instill this kind of humor and my brother and I are discovering the world together very close I think you know that that obviously. You know leads to both of those looking for moments to make people laugh and I think New York also grant India Tanzania has a funny. What do you. I got queens is arguably the most diverse places in the country yes yes or yes I think the organs and nothing New York is tough it's hard to with the queen's that we it and you know. A fairly decent I'm it wasn't like the roughest areas but still it was like New York. Is crowded it is you know classrooms were crowded we with public school education. It forces you to be a little stronger rate things aren't catered to you and I think. You know as an adult like subways like they're that great equalizer regardless of their class if you're on a subway everyone the same way everyone feel the same thing that once smelled the same things that anyone. It's there's some it very clear current yes and if you you're forced to confront reality and I think you know as a result you have to cope and you cope with humor and I think nudism dark. A ducts at the humorous in New Yorkers. We're very quick I grew up late you know snapping back and forth friends like insulting each other that's normal rain late you know the idea I've met people after the fact who that Michael wise everything have to be elected Cho gruesome unlike. It that's what communicated so we all communicated to congress as the conversation might not the citizens substance of what we're saying but it's it's said through humor and so. I think all of that late you know plus being in Europe where it but it's the most famous comedy scene in the country like. I was exposed to comedy both click informally and formally my whole life. And I feel like asking this question this kind of living up to stereotypes kind of hate task at that he and it will be as Iowa's wonder I'm first generation American pure wonder. How much of that is a shared experience yet it was there pressure. To kind of live out dreams not for your parents to sort of like do battered do more. My hand and certainly but my parents were never. And you have to do this yet but they were always. Progress in the sensibly worried about. You know lake. Us feel that wants to be happy would Everett was happy healthy and of course a mentally comedy was something newer. There's it was a phase the long as it was a phase them as certain practical enough to know that's. I mean now oh. Let's head fifth at that. Much more financially lucrative insecure if this is a phase but when you told them this was the chosen path what did they say I mean at that point was already late I got a master's degree of foreign made this the chosen paths that's finally I jumped into her before college today and I was doing in the high school and college. It was obvious they had idea moved to Seattle to be human rights organizes a keep that in mind went from wine to be a lawyer to be human rights ordinance to a comedians like kind of very. With subtlety. An intention lowered the bar so by the time we got to comedian they were already on board of this is not to be what we want. And to settle for some things he's doing some things. But I do ask you about at that obviously had to inform the way you approach a comedy out your experiences and rights organizer on the West Coast and also. The decision to go in a master's in human right yes right now. I mean you know I'm. I'm somebody who came of age. After 9/11 again wrecked. I remember pre 9/11 and remember what that life was like and I remember how things change pretty immediately after. So from might yet happen I was eighteen so from from my adulthood it's post nine elevenths so. And I grew up in a really diverse place where I grew up in a place that rest of the country apparently fears Ursula been told rent. Something rarely has multiple languages and ideas and religions like you know the idea of being Muslim is and that's a scary for thing my best friends or muscle. In a group in mosques playing you know. And the Hindu I also have the the the weird. Like the thing. Lake there's a a rivalry that Islam but there's that you know that is hatred from years past of Hindus and Muslims and other countries that. You know get carried here that like. Me and my friends don't really think about is like in the air crane lake Villa like generations past legacy and so much more complex than what people have here you know play it SO the like eight grew up with that comes with already used complicated. Multi layered thing which I certainly didn't realize until I left in queen though at a college in Maine which was very different. And that. 1911 happens I'm already being more conscious about race because you home with every I was humane and as I was about in colleges Zoellick you know already in my life was different of them like I was hit with this is what rich means and visible wealthy mean about rich wealthy brain this is all the money. That it isn't a coincidence that your last name is the same name of that building that's like it was. The youth in summer as a verb like all the stuff that a I am I did not do I went to public schools mile live up to that point and already the class differences is there and then the race things you know. Of being seen as an outsider Bradman and when I went to public schools I was a brown kid going to. You know rich white kids school in Maine so. Already that was there but the 9/11 happens and you're getting hit with that already in all the sudden. The whole country the whole country you seen a little differently so what changed for you specifically where there instances that follow he. I mean reading about hate crimes on the country certainly was in which is embarrassing that it it it hit. This is happening to the black community is tennis and has been happening for ever rent but all the sudden as an eighteen year old hits me like. These are happening all over the country in the when they start happening in Queens. That's when it really hit. You know literally hit home because it felt like all of this is all that these or other places. These are diverse places these are not mine people in the Michael we grew up together. And and you know -- immediately as his presence been number up to do we know each other's kids at Amazon neighborhoods and it's happening here it'll say things to you. In Queens in sure is sure you know you before and after you know it's not like ignorance started post nine elevenths. But certainly was elevated you know after that and worked at you know local just attorney's office in the hate crimes BO so I saw what was happening in my view I was definitely informed. I mean all those things really shaped the way I saw the world you know and it forced me to ask more questions and you know the idea that the civil rights movement is a living thing it's not just a period. Of time it's something we're still fighting for are always fighting for justice these of things I didn't have instilled until after 9/11. And up to that point I was doing comedy bit my comedy to that point was just trying to make people laugh by any means necessary which meant like. Accents. You know what did I know from house south Asians are portrayed in the media again accents made people laugh. Ray we weren't full people we didn't need to be full people we just have to be Karadzic's. I didn't know any other way to deal brand I wasn't given that many role model eligible Marla really had. Was was Margaret Cho you know and Margaret had a lot of debt I'd I was a kin have depth yet. But I knew from deathly from watching the Simpsons at least that like if I used accents. I would make people laugh and that's comedy was. Q do you access now. My post silent and everything kind of change that regard it felt lake having a public. Stayed to such a privilege even at that level as as an 181920 year old with with a college audience. It was a privilege. And I knew that I had a voice and people will. Listen to and there was some level of influence there. So with all that experience and not just like experience a professional it and think you're seeing you clearly have like eight. Sort of moral awakening that Genesis this is something that needs to be addressed. Which is local something a lot of people young people I think are having now with the trump elections yes and I see that college campuses I see this. This people are alive in no way that I remember posts eleven there was a lot of us that woke up at the same time so why comedy why did you decide to channel all of that there why I mean I like comedy and Tyler comes and those 161516. Years old there wasn't a noble thing you know I loved comedy like it was. You know why you could start a band I wanna be a fight for freedom now because I like music I play in danced and I didn't know how to play an instrument my poetry set so elated at comedy. My love comedy union that was that was that at a comedy well before it became more aware of the bigger issues in the world his love the art form in crystal of the art from intact and so. You know as. Comedies wonderful and because that there's such as there's a direct connection to what you experience whether it's. The macro the Microsemi happen today can talk about it immediately at I've come. I thought about these big issues in my life I can talk about it immediately something so direct about it so as you will evolve as a human being. There there's. It is a very little there's a three small buffer there isn't isn't like I have to months and years to write this novel mind on stage I'm figuring it out with the audience. And talking about things that are happening now yet. News talk about always have current format from that point on I I realize that like. You know you can ignore what's there so I couldn't question because you you can you even do comedy as you mentioned that a lot of different way he's right. But you are very intentional there's almost an activism. A kind yet there. It it's not. I think early on I definitely saw the two things as the same thing you know I don't now. I certainly at the time you know was on state saying these are the things they need to cover the people need to know and I need to say them. And figure out a way to make them funny and we finally to make them funny though those under an as certain point you realize. You do yourself a disservice you do your audience a disservice and you do whatever you care but a disservice if you're not focused on the task at hand returned to something other than just making the task at hand isn't to inform the task it has to make people laugh if you wanna inform people I know all the ways to do that because I used to do that organizer right. This isn't that this is a comedy show you need to make people laugh and if if you do this to the best of your ability in that way that's almost as revolutionary. Like people are actually willing to listen to you there and and not only is that humanize you and relate to you. And I. You know it it's a work in progress. But that's so crucial so yeah I would say early on I was up there saying the things I believe what I Osce treated mice stages a soapbox of that point. And it took years to try to figure out what all the I knew how to write jokes even early on I was good with structure. I threw that way to talk with the things that cared about how to integrate the two how delay of its you know. Continue being great later develop as a writer while talking about things that are close to me let my here roasted. But prior Harland Margaret Cho Chris Rock Chappelle. They they're talking about big issues not because they have to but because that's in their hearts and that's in their mind that's what they think about. So much of your work to focuses on your experience on other communities of color showed a minority communities in America. And I'm I'm curious because like all comics he probably had to travel the country to a lot of different kinds of places in communities. Does years. Material lands differently in some audiences yen the idols a lyric. It's funny like in like if you're an all white room yet middle America DL the same joke the same way. Bomb. Well no because that's a thing it's that in general. That's being a bad comedian I think in general even if it's a different rooms and New York you have to see what's happening in in the room then you have to react to Bryant so. They have fight -- say a couple of adjustments clues some discomfort let me figure out the discomfort address let me find a way to get them on my side and and you know I'm gonna change my point of view yeah. But I wanna try to find a way it's so the so I do my job to find a way to make it work like. You know you've had teachers that stick to the lesson plan regardless of what's happening and they don't care and you know they don't care and and you know of the teachers. That like or in the moment and scientists say that they haven't rehearsed the same funny line like for six periods in a row wreck but they also know. How to get it to this particular group of kids that's what the but those of the best he does the teachers I remember. Rent the ones that found a way to reach me and it wasn't the same thing and they knew that every class but every kid wasn't the same. You know that every kid was different in every room was different and this is right after lunch they're gonna be. The rule will tire because that is state the first class of the day so they're exhausted because of date in the morning got to change he actually I don't you have to realize what's in the room consulates same thing is. In the same becomes when you travel the country. What just happened here what happened in Charleston I'm to engage in Charleston what leftists and Charleston yes. You know I'm I'm in North Carolina collections done obviously North Carolina went red but I'm men I'm in chapel hill's what does that mean right. AM in Chicago I'm talking about gun violence but in Chicago that means something tears specifically you have to realize what's there. But when you talk about race so much in the way that you do to let you make fun of white people sure it's I mean act and make anoint him on the senses that make from the white Tennessee and I mean yes quite identity go out easily anyway and absolutely. Absolutely because like. Bull won I grew up where you didn't see much of that. I don't know how it is now from little a little better but lake. You know from the people of color rumors the where were the jokes came from. We were the props right. We were talked about weeding it to write the scripts and we didn't get to speak for ourselves cancel what is it like when it's the other way around and it's very interesting when you have an audience. That's I'm very mixed to mostly people of color. For the white people on an audience to hear catharsis to laughter. You know articulate what's going on here you know this isn't just some people don't like it when we knew very adamant about that some people if you had like about experience is silent man in regularly people walked notes people Hackl. I've had people threaten me in the middle of a show. That people say racist things of the of the worst on Donaldson the ones who say racist things. Loud enough so I can hear and what Yukio. Well if that's the thing it's Lama frighten him put out loud enough for a real health community you have to make the call to light disrupt the show is when that happens you know you have to restate that things of that audience knows what's happening otherwise you Armenia yelling at somebody. You would have had to learn the hard way lake I'm so upset I'm reacting vs thinking about. No it's not about them it's about the show this person's going after me how to incorporate this or doesn't distract. At the end of the day. You know if if it's gonna hurt the whole show it's not about this this maniac who's this basis you know. You nor I might ignore book. And the thing is it that I ignore it publicly animals eating field amongst the taking it in have to deal with the fact that this. Person decided it was okay to say this to hurt me. It wasn't to be a jerk it was and to make a scene it was still hurt me don't know hearing from the units in the wrote in the front rows. Like for you know I mean why he had a lot of people and I actually read an accountant and an arm of the name of the gentleman someone Hispanic I couldn't go on and humane comedy anymore. Because the heckling was getting so that end zone nasty it wasn't like hey you staying. It was racial stuff that was sexist stuff that was it kind of stuff that you would you can you'd never think if someone to grant dates. Because I know that of the people I'm. Reaching an people who were laughing. It's more important to them. And that that I'm getting more often them on the positive end and that the negativity the few people are giving me and that they're notice activity in summer comes from feeder who. You know they don't understand this they don't like this the comes from fear. And that always been there has it gotten better or worse every hand is the Thomas has gotten better just because like you know there's more south Asians in the media business operations in comedy is more south Asians with. A broader range of characteristics being displayed you know we're not one dimensional and and so. When our onstage as a twenty to 23 year old in new York and Seattle. You know and that wasn't tuning accents people to know what to do with me pain Michael what is this and he's not being of the idea of addressing the elephant in the room like. Skin colors and on got an elephant in the room when they idea that I have to. Address that and every time the way the a lot of things are women selected as his address that fact that women first hand as opposed as a human being with a set of experiences like. But there's a little less of that somewhere else comes from success like you know it's not like a meal with unfamiliar with you're. I'm not like a wise this guy brown it's it's hurry. You know it makes things a lot easier when people know what they're coming to see obviously you know and it wasn't like that ten years of in the climate has changed like. You know Aziz and Mindy are groundbreaking figures just because it doesn't matter if they're saying groundbreaking things and I'm they exist and they have control and a certain degree of dignity. That we didn't have. For it is as you've gotten more successful we have more more people no you sure it you know. Do you feel any responsibility. To try. To. Make things better to change he used to you don't really formula to make people laugh but now you have a microphone anyway that a lot of other people. Didn't before UN may not. Is there any sense of like how can I need to try to make things. Of course what that is different ways to do that I don't think stand up is that the right. You know what I mean I think my stance proves to be effective it's used in college in classrooms high school that's on curriculums like I know that lake. Is to it wasn't the intention right now. But that's unify think about that wait for the work's not going to be is as good you know. How Randall pod cast the bright can be blunt clinically mentally and be blunt and also our podcast but I do with the peak mount bout then we have sections we explain concepts of peoples who were on the same page and it. Is that there's there's other ways for. You know from for me to get information people and and two. You know too too too aggressively deal with the things that are. And my heart and head in on don't think stand at this goes on but I do I do think everything there is a responsibility and I'm making a film right now. About up who from the Simpsons why fret about representation it's easier to TV and you know it's part of it is certainly is an identity aspect to rip apart it to me is also like. When you think of 9/11 and post 9/11 backlash used it's not just. As simple as people are ignorant they see the brown people on the attack them to get to that point you have to not humanize that person. And you can't humanize that person because you you haven't seen him be human. Look as. As people of color we've had to humanize lay people we've had no choice Reich puzzles are teachers and our neighbors we see them on television a broad range of life experiences right. That I'm watching a movie you know that's exactly my life experience but I can understand and a human level which is there something in the from grammar absolutely which is why it's frustrating when you hear people say no one's gonna believe that a personal colors playing this part notably an. That this kind of and an interracial marriage in this in this movie will work moments in a believe that the capital like that. To me it's like saying you don't think I can exist in this way you don't humanize me the way I've been forced to humanize you ride. So when 9/11 haven't amounting who denial of that are directly connected but there's something to be said about you are not a full person to me. I don't understand you as a full person. I don't notice seek is I don't know. You know what what your life could be like I can't imagine you with the family. I don't imagine any of those things. Is that ill links Dave two without Asian yes he or anything terrorist. Or terrorists in the red area there cartoon of that that is weak yen has no. Controls their lives ray or you're a terrorist earlier a cab driver who doesn't have a it's something wrong with being convenience store owner a cabdriver. But the UQ are in the servant class or not someone who's actually expressing range what does that have drivers experience. What is a convenience owners experience who whether Pham is how did they end up here that's never relevant to their props. Due process the election. Com. I mean I think it was. Driven by a again as you can't say racism is in the part of you can't because you know I'm not saying that. Half the country's racist but. There are certainly people who. Justified racist things are being says and looked past it because they want something else it dismissed. Dismiss either dismissed it or didn't like it but they couldn't vote for Hillary couldn't vote. For anybody other than Republican and still saw what you make a compromise at this person's racist and saying racist things and I don't like hearing the split. Chops the past believe jobs or you don't know how economics work really so. This man's as a business person vote like being a business person successful doesn't mean you know how to remic come. It's expected a year earlier point you're making if people if it offense large section of the country's only ever known bloom color in a certain contact and I don't live. In the environment your regularly bumping up against those other experiences and passion and humanize and being able to see them useful people this. Dude works in the kitchen and that's the job I could of had this person does construction that's just utterly but it. They could've humanize your there's no I mean you you have to announcing the person has competition of deceit president's part of the community and languages sometimes an issue but the what you do his stroller and each other's language and you try to find a way to connect Bethel community. Tension is let me talk about racism in the election in modern times I think people think prescribing that to the people who support it mr. trump. To say that there was there was an element of race undeniably but that they sort of dismissed it or in small thing that maybe even participated monitoring and whenever. What if it just wasn't even a factor because that doesn't matter in their communities they don't have people of color they're not we're not that used to that impeachment. What you ignore also so some things here. You know if you if you don't defeat it's a brace its. It's not like it doesn't exist there's something to be said about ignoring something allow something to happen you're aiding and abetting in racism even if you are not actively taking part in it. But if you're not UN and I and you haven't experienced. Yes I guess can we can you blame people for dismissing. If they've never experienced it if it's never been a part of there they've always been on the side of the equation where it didn't really affect. Ahmet if this was the 1920s. I might agree with you. But media has changed. Unity eat it they're gonna hear about racism they're winning you people stores and they might react. By saying. You know again with the race card playing it again there's still having did hear the story and decide whether they want to believe it. So yeah at a certain point. If you're given information time and time again those people are you and they choose to ignore they refuse to humanize other people. That's racism. That's racism B you can't say it will they've never had experience with that. I didn't have experience was latent white people from the midwest. But I still see them as human beings. Because I've seen their stories over and over and over again you know it to the point where I can watch field of dreams and I'm not gonna be like. Met people in the midwest they're nuts they just destroy their fields for. For for baseball fields and they believe in ghosts knowledge been absurd thing to say because I've seen more than one. White's story about the midwest you know. It's great of the top three sports als isn't that the baseball movie which is great which is also some bank in always connect with people on but his latest. Since miserably but. But pound with. Little League short Little League career but like. Of a you can't I mean I I refuse to believe that people aren't exposed to race in some form at this point we had a black president. You telling me people are really colorblind that nobody notices and if they didn't notice that they didn't hear about it and some press or some relative to children and it was just business as usual no lake. People aren't completely in their bubbles things reach them they have to make choices. And if they're unable to humanize other people in understand their stories at a certain point it's on them. This isn't 5060 years ago it's now things are very different you have access to stories and ideas to your it was believed. You're the last question. And sure it'd be to the people who felt my. This last presidency. Did not speak to their lives their wages went down ten segment of the population non college educated that they did see their wages decline shore over the last decade. If you felt like this system isn't working for me. This president didn't work for me. Throw it all out the window. This guy could be my one shot. You have to be willing to understand that the president. Definitely has impact but some of the stuff is systemic. It doesn't come until a magical person who takes over and fixes everything. Well we've laid clearly discovered is the person in touch can easily destroy everything or make decisions that put the country at risk. But if you wanna but the but it's harder do the other side and it's harder to. To rebuild things that's harder to create jobs it's harder to. Allocate funds elsewhere it's harder to. Bum deal with a congress that you know eight Obama had a congress that was. Was blue when he started. But but at the senate doesn't mean that everyone's on the same page rate these or not you have to understand how those things work. Because if you think that let bull bottles and off as a leading get these things and so it's his fault stylus works plus the fact that lake. You know people to know the difference between Obama care and the American to care Affordable Care Act so. What is that like if you if if you don't understand that stuff. You're not making an informed decision you're making it based on. On hearsay. And false news and what your uncle said that and at it and chain email and we what is the you know. And if you're not exposed. The black people and you just exposed to a few images and the president will easily doing things through the black people it's only cares little about race with them it's like. But he that'll happen if you really don't have a broad range of experience. How do you patty be funny. National and this presidency and is a lot of material America's environment that this heaviest stuff to Armenian so this could have theory. Real serious impacts on people's lives and RD time. This is you know in some ways this isn't new it's just more exposed now some of its new because it's like cheese lake I've never seen. In such a short period of time like. But you've seen the bones of the administration's it's like the hiding very much fumble laying Blake. The bitterness of present its treating from his personal account to you know had to delete tweets about the Oscars to somebody detect tweet of a youth and the announcement. Lake that's new. But he but the rest of it line you know of the racial anxiety you know he doesn't doll with sleet screams like. This is not you know this doesn't know and so there was that mean for your hour by means that like the stuff I was talking about before turning to convince people the first step isn't to say what he said. Loaded on a you know this of freezing established the progress that yet followed bishop president I think cut to the chase I mean look that's the unfortunate thing is that lake of the stuff a couple of this fairly evergreen racism unfortunately is evergreen as a sexism and homophobia there's been. Change in progress and mutations so it looks different but. He's ever been things I can I can talk about them because they're happening and it happens been so for me it doesn't change. All that much it just it forces me to kind of just. I have to address what's happening on top more than I normally do because normally I don't like talking about politics. That stood at sports to me. Some if you're into sports great if you knives and that separates view but. Now I think more people into sports and anemic it's hard when it's so accessible now because he says things that are so blatant the blunt you know. Come here to the point where you can give a speech but his his recent joint session yes. And this beacon stumble and fumble but it's seen as a good speech because the bar's been so different. He has been so low and to the point where he gives. I mean in the joint session in early stumble and fumble that he 88 did you read off prompter volatile days. Bristol stumbled and fumbled and made it a few words that he people who look openly that they together again yet I think we're so used to handling really are as though you're saying does a company speaking there were words he made there was that there are things that I got so used to into the Hamlet OK and we know that. And he'd he'd deftly moved as a Mfume known as a performer I'm like okay he deftly improvised a few words as he yes might have lost his. Place on the prompter any trying to fill in space that are moments moment of his sting eagle has driven and so prone to want to sort of. In provide embellishment here and there scrapped its so and that's not a part of the ever steady through in the catch phrase he makes money every on the hat sold lake. That's not normal and also link with peoples and to be ignore -- believed that he addressed the hate crimes stuff and its duties of that you have right off the top ready and he also in the Middle East slipped in the voice businessman he's sly and Mike the homeland security office for us people to report crimes committed against them that I immigrants rain. It's not a small thing. Yet and somehow it a secret police force the but he slipped that in the middle. So let's focus on the actions late words are words that doesn't mean any thing late one of the actions and so. Now I think we were were the bar is so low. That he can give us lip service about late hate crimes are bad well it. Yet wow yes they are bad throng with a of course a bad. And and he basically. You know tacitly. Is saying that violence against immigrants is good because we have a government agency. That's as went immigrants are hurting you specifically that the dome brand of violence he should reported. When your tacitly. You know. When you are pointing at a specific group sensing this specific group is trouble. Here tacitly giving permission to people to react to it just like with the war on terrorism during the bush era if you know if you since I he was instead fast enough. I think especially early with talk and how we're all Americans. Muslims are Americans. So a lot of hate crimes early on you when you Philip you know. Blinked but more than when he sailing getting people out of their caves in need to humanize Muslims off the bat it's hearts at. To get that back in the Bachmann ticket out and so that was enough. I'm charity gives outsize importance to use something that's not really a problem Bradley the actual crimes committed by an document they missed me. Non existent. So. Your albums toys for a teenager debut coming album rent waiting for money for you do yep sounds very threatening to suck and if it can't think that's the area that white majority is supposed to become technical minority which it's funny is that the album is about the fact that that's not important to pry the head. Fifth split you know I can't you can't really wait for 2042 but it's really none point ultimately we needed. Not entitle Mecca that and it won a ST on apple is on the first suspected in wanted to get that they two point. Mainstream American comic is related yeah. I want to ask you about the cover the very thick that they have viewed its provocative. Lieutenant. A UN of the truth he. Its it department that nurtured this but. The photos actually soda asked to be in a sexy Asian and callon their cool also oh lead my friend Katie we took a bunch of pictures from the counter. And easily cover for this album and in this is one of the outtakes. And so if it works so well already as it can you do your best describe it is telling you shorten your its Meehan a USA flag jacket on no undershirt. Provocatively and zipped lake chest hair all up in your face. Tom in in my. South Asian man goodness like it's that that you know it's the I'm very proud of that picks are you how you feel about it when you look at it I'm handsome man look handsome. An argument and the funny thing about it is there's some people who late because they think it's funny just funny. The some people who like because it's like Omega fully confident and also some people's votes really picture. I love the faculty of those things that list. And that I've gotten to do all those things that it was unintentional under the name of the album is going to be mainstream American comic and decided that but. But it is perfect and it looks like an American Apparel ad. It tough thing that and that's intentional. Again now it's that it's both albums really you know they're they're similar in that they talk about. Complete lake what is the place of a person of color and society. And talk about it and the deal I talk about racism and violence. And class and gender and sexuality in the idea of of marginalization and the fact that lake. Being marginalized identity like being a minority groups though makes you mainstream. You know because of that the story. Of the oppressed is the story of America. And so analysts say that was is not funny but late that's basically the theme you see that the route. Both records and the last one units called mainstream American comic. Also because I talk about you know politics for the first and only about. Republicans and Democrats all that much I did for this one so that wasn't an attempt Elton reaped what it can do this thing too which have done so you don't. Anything more do now but like it it's it to me and historically it's kinda like. I don't. I'd rather talk about Obama and the drones as opposed to getting legislation through and let rather talk about. How the legislation is being described what people know roses like.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/man-threatened-jews-metal-music-site-faces-sentencing-46829339,"A Connecticut man who posted threats against Jews and synagogues on a metal music internet forum plans to argue at his sentencing that he has served enough time in prison.

Kendall Sullivan is scheduled to go before a U.S. District judge in Bridgeport on Monday. He pleaded guilty in January to perpetrating a hoax and originally faced three federal charges of making online threats.

The 50-year-old was arrested in July following an investigation that linked him to messages posted that spring and summer on the Metalthrone.net website.

""I will slaughter them and burn their Synagogue to the ground . . . kids, goldfish, old folks. Shove money down their throats,"" Sullivan wrote under the screen name KS43. ""These Jews of 2016. They think they are safe.""

Investigators searched Sullivan's Stamford home and found more than two dozen firearms, gun parts, high-capacity magazines and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

Patricia Ferrick, the agent in charge of the FBI's New Haven division, said at the time that authorities ""may have averted a horrific hate crime from occurring.""

Sullivan is in state prison serving four consecutive 90-day sentences after pleading guilty to weapons charges. Prosecutors plan to argue he also should serve at least a year in federal prison on the hoax charge.

But Sullivan and his attorneys say he's been punished enough. They contend his posts were not meant to be taken seriously and were part of a heavy metal music culture rooted in themes that ""society deems off limits, including the occult, war, death and destruction.""

""Mr. Sullivan has found mostly disappointment and punishing loneliness in this life,"" they wrote. ""It is no small mystery that he turned to the internet to express his frustrations among other dejected, frustrated white men from suburbia. He spouted off nonsense for shock value among others who took pleasure being shocked.""",abcnews.com,True

As Roof's grandfather Joe Roof, a longtime real estate lawyer in Columbia, South Carolina, addressed the court for the first time today, he said, ""Dylann is not all bad.""

His grandson, who is white, has already been convicted of hate crimes in a federal case and has been sentenced to death for the murders of nine black parishioners at the Emanuel AME Church in June 2015.

""We’re sorry,"" Joe Roof said, adding, ""We have been distressed and just sick over what has happened to these families.""

""My wife and I have them in our prayers every night, every meal,"" Joe Roof said.

""What happened here I will never understand,"" he added. ""I will go to my grave not understanding.""

Joe Roof said he's lost his grandson, who turned 23 last week, and said today is likely the last time he will see him. ""I'm just aching to hold him and hug him as I did when he was a tot,"" he said.

He added: ""The system which I worked in almost 60 years now and believe in seems to have worked as it should have worked.""

Family members of Roof's nine victims also spoke.

Nadine Collier, daughter of victim Ethel Lance, who was thrust into the spotlight after she told Dylann Roof she forgave him at his bond hearing less than 48 hours after the shooting, said today she still forgives him and now she is moving on.

""Today I wanted to address the court. I wanted to say to Dylann Roof I’m the one that forgave you in the bond hearing, and I still do today,"" Collier said.

""He came here to start a battle -- but I win the war,"" Collier continued. ""I wore white today to let everybody know the chapter in my life right now today is closed. I will not open that book again. And I just want to say have mercy on your soul.""

Melvin Graham, brother of victim Cynthia Hurd, was emotional as he spoke in court, saying he wanted to let Hurd speak for herself. Graham read an email that Hurd sent to their sister in 2013; Graham said Hurd sent the email when their sister was having a difficult time handling the death of their parents.

In the email, which Graham read aloud, Hurd said that Easter was her favorite holiday because it reminded her that death is not forever and they will have the chance to be reunited one day.

Blondell Gadsden, sister of victim Myra Thompson, said to the court of Dylann Roof, ""Even though we're at a point where death has been the sentence for him, my heart still goes out to him in hopes that he would repent to save himself from himself.""

""I can't think of anything worse that he could do at this point than to not accept Christ and try to make his days on this earth a little bit more peaceful,"" Gadsden added. ""I come here today not to do anything more than to thank the court system and on behalf of my family say that we are pleased with everything that has been done.""

Dylann Roof, who was sentenced to death in January in his federal trial, today pleaded guilty to all state charges, including nine counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder, instead of going through a second trial.

Dylann Roof's guilty plea in state court was in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of parole.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/key-moments-charleston-church-shooting-case-dylann-roof/story?id=46701033,"Nearly two years after Dylann Roof opened fire at a Bible study at a Charleston, South Carolina, church, killing nine black parishioners, the convicted killer pleaded guilty today in state court.

Roof, who turned 23 last week, has already been convicted of hate crimes in a federal case and has been sentenced to death for the murders at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church in June 2015.

As Roof returned to court this afternoon, here is a look back at the pivotal moments in the Charleston church tragedy.

June 17, 2015: The shooting

The night of June 17, 2015, 21-year-old Roof, who is white, entered the Emanuel AME Church and attended a Bible study, where he was welcomed by the parishioners, according to authorities. Roof then drew his pistol and opened fire, authorities said.

Felicia Sanders, a survivor of the shooting, later testified that when Roof opened fire she clutched her granddaughter tight and told her to play dead.

""I could feel the warm blood flowing on each side of me,"" she said.

""I was just waiting on my turn,"" she added. ""Even if I got shot, I just didn't want my granddaughter to get shot.""

Amid the chaos and the bloodshed, her youngest son, Tywanza Sanders, stood up and confronted the assailant: ""Why are you doing this?"" he asked, according to Felicia Sanders' testimony.

""And he told our son, 'I have to do this because y'all raping our women and taking over the world,'"" Felicia Sanders said. ""And that's when [the gunman] put about five bullets in my son.

""We watched him take his last breath,"" she said of her son. ""I watched my son come into this world, and I watched my son leave this world.""

After fatally shooting nine people, Roof walked out the door, to his car and fled, leaving the carnage behind him.

June 18, 2015: A suspect is captured

The morning after the massacre, Roof was apprehended at a traffic stop in Shelby, North Carolina, about 245 miles north of the Charleston church.

Roof had a handwritten note in his car with the names of several churches on it, a Confederate flag, a burned U.S. flag, a gun, an empty box of ammunition and a laser attachment for a gun that helps with accuracy, according to authorities.

June 19, 2015: Victims' families offer forgiveness

Less than 48 hours after the shooting, some victims' family members spoke at Roof's first court appearance and offered forgiveness to the 21-year-old.

“I forgive you,” Nadine Collier, the daughter of victim Ethel Lance, said through tears to Roof, who appeared at the bond hearing via video conferencing from jail. ""You took something very precious from me and I will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again. But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.""

Reuters

Anthony Thompson, the husband of victim Myra Thompson, said, ""I forgive you. But we would like you to take this opportunity to repent. Repent, confess, give your life to the one who matters most: Christ. So that he can change it, can change your ways no matter what happened to you and you'll be OK. Do that and you'll be better off than what you are right now.""

Dec. 15, 2016: A guilty verdict in federal hate crimes case

On Dec. 15, 2016, Roof was found guilty on all 33 counts in his federal trial, including hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death.

During the emotional trial, survivor Polly Sheppard testified that she saw Roof shoot another churchgoer, then she ducked under a table.

Sheppard testified that Roof told her to shut up as she was praying out loud.

Then, she said, Roof asked her whether she was shot. She told him no, she added, and he replied that he wouldn't shoot her. ""I’m going to leave you alive to tell the story,"" Sheppard said Roof told her.

A video interview of Roof conducted by an FBI agent shortly after he was captured was also played in court. In the video Roof laughed as he admitted to the shooting.

In the video Roof said he used a .45-caliber Glock to commit the crime. ""I didn't say anything to them before I pulled it out, not even one word,"" Roof says of the gun in the video. ""I mean, they reacted after I shot them.""

""I am guilty,"" he said in the video, laughing.

Defense attorney David Bruck said in court that Roof committed the crime but the trial involves understanding ""who this person was and why on earth he would want to cause so much grief.""

Jan. 10, 2017: Roof sentenced to death in federal case

Roof was sentenced to death Jan. 10, 2017, the first time a death penalty verdict was rendered in a federal hate crimes case, the Justice Department said.

The jury's decision had to be unanimous to sentence Roof to death.

The jury spent less than one day deliberating Roof's fate, after Roof told the jurors in a closing statement in the sentencing phase, ""I still feel like I had to do it.""

In the government's closing argument in the sentencing phase, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson said that before the killings, Roof's racist hatred had built up for years. Roof scouted the Emanuel AME Church months before, calling and visiting, Richardson said.

After Roof left the scene of the shooting, Richardson said, he ""fully understood the horrific nature"" of his crime.

While Roof expressed sorrow to his parents and pity for himself, he didn't shed a tear for the people he killed, Richardson said. Roof showed multiple times that he didn't have remorse, according to Richardson, from his jailhouse manifesto with racist language to the shoes he wore in court during the federal trial that had racist symbols on them.

Roof's defense said in a statement at the time that the ""sentencing decision means that this case will not be over for a very long time. We are sorry that, despite our best efforts, the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy.""

The defense added that they express sympathy ""to all of the families who were so grievously hurt by Dylann Roof’s actions.""

Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement, ""Roof sought out and opened fire on African-American parishioners engaged in worship. ... He did so because of their race. And he did so to interfere with their peaceful exercise of religion. The victims in the case led lives as compassionate civic and religious leaders; devoted public servants and teachers; and beloved family members and friends.

""No verdict can bring back the nine we lost that day at Mother Emanuel,"" Lynch continued. ""And no verdict can heal the wounds of the five church members who survived the attack or the souls of those who lost loved ones to Roof’s callous hand. But we hope that the completion of the prosecution provides the people of Charleston -- and the people of our nation -- with a measure of closure.""

April 10, 2017: Roof pleads guilty in state case

Roof today pleaded guilty to all state charges, including nine counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder, instead of going through a second trial.

Roof's grandfather Joe Roof addressed the court for the first time today, saying ""We’re sorry,"" and adding, ""Dylann is not all bad.""

""What happened here I will never understand,"" Joe Roof said. ""I will go to my grave not understanding.""

Dylann Roof's guilty plea in state court was in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Ninth Circuit Solicitor Scarlett Wilson said today that the mission for the guilty plea was to get the ""surest path to Dylann Roof's execution"" in connection with the federal trial.

Malcolm Graham, the brother of victim Cynthia Hurd, said today, ""The sun is shining bright. She is smiling down. Justice was served today.""

James Jackson, 28, who is accused of fatally stabbing 66-year-old Timothy Caughman on March 20, is the first defendant charged with murder as an act of terrorism in Manhattan since the statute was revised after the 9/11 attacks.

According to Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, Jackson, an Army veteran from Baltimore, ""prowled the streets of New York for three days in search of a black person to assassinate in order to launch a campaign of terrorism against our Manhattan community and the values we celebrate.""

“With total presence of mind, he acted on his plan, randomly selecting a beloved New Yorker solely on the basis of his skin color, and stabbing him repeatedly and publicly on a Midtown street corner,"" Vance said in an earlier statement. ""James Jackson wanted to kill black men, planned to kill black men, and then did kill a black man.""

Jackson has been charged with one count of murder in the first degree as an act of terrorism; one count of murder in the second degree as an act of terrorism; one count of murder in the second degree as a hate crime; and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.

In court this morning Jackson didn't say anything beyond entering his not guilty plea.

A 14-year-old boy faces charges of aggravated criminal sexual assault and making and disseminating child pornography in connection to the case, and Police Commander Brendan Deenihan said in a press conference that an arrest warrant has also been issued for another teenage boy, and police expect to charge others, including one adult.

""The detectives working with Facebook have executed several social media search warrants and we were able to eventually identify two of these offenders and secure arrests warrants for them,"" Deenihan announced.

""One of the offenders [the 14-year-old] ... has now been charged,"" he said. ""There's a second juvenile warrant that is out there and we expect that individual to be arrested soon and then additionally we still have several other offenders that we need to specifically identify and are arrested as well.""

About 40 people viewed the attack live, and none of them reported it, police said.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson led off the press conference with passionate words about the victim.

""As a father of young women myself, I am so inspired by her strength, and while I know the emotional wounds caused by this savagery will take long to heal, I'm hopeful that her story can be an inspiration to so many other young women who are victimized by bullying and sexual assault,"" Johnson said.

Johnson said that he was first approached by the 15-year-old girl's mother, who she said ""had been missing for more than 24 hours"" and then showed him ""snapshots of a video which depicted her daughter being sexually assaulted live on the internet.""

""No woman should ever be treated the way this young woman was,"" Johnson said.

Johnson, who has become a recognizable face nationally due to the press conferences he's given regarding Chicago's shooting epidemic, also scolded those who participated.

""Due to the graphic content that I observed, I don't want to go into the details of what was on the video but I want to tell you the young [men] responsible, they should be ashamed of themselves,"" Johnson said.

""They’ve humiliated themselves, humiliated their families, and now they're going to be held accountable for what they've done,"" he added.

The case is not the first high profile crime broadcast live on Facebook this year to come out of Chicago.

Earlier in the year, a man was tortured in a Facebook Live video, before eventually escaping his captors.

That case was categorized as a hate crime, and had strong racial overtones, with four black suspects binding and attacking a white special-needs teenager.

James Jackson, 28, an Army veteran from Baltimore, ""prowled the streets of New York for three days in search of a black person to assassinate in order to launch a campaign of terrorism against our Manhattan community and the values we celebrate,” Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance said.

Today a grand jury returned an indictment against Jackson, who is accused of fatally stabbing 66-year-old Timothy Caughman last week.

Jackson was charged with one count of murder in the first degree as an act of terrorism; one count of murder in the second degree as an act of terrorism; one count of murder in the second degree as a hate crime; and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.

“Last week, with total presence of mind, he acted on his plan, randomly selecting a beloved New Yorker solely on the basis of his skin color, and stabbing him repeatedly and publicly on a Midtown street corner,"" Vance said.

""James Jackson wanted to kill black men, planned to kill black men, and then did kill a black man,"" Vance said.

In a jailhouse interview with the Daily News, Jackson reportedly said of his victim, “I didn’t know he was elderly.""

He also reportedly told the Daily News he would have rather killed “a young thug” or “a successful older black man with blonds.""

Jackson reportedly said he wanted the murder to be “a practice run” for a bigger plan that would have more casualties, which he also allegedly told investigators.

Vance said that Jackson chose Midtown ""because Manhattan is the media capital of the world, and a place where people of different races live together and love one another. We must never take for granted New York’s remarkable diversity. We must celebrate it, protect it, and refuse to let violence and hate undermine the progress we have made as a city, a state, and a nation.”

Jackson's next court date is set for April 13. His lawyer, Sam Talkin, declined comment to ABC News today, but said after his initial appearance in court that he would consider an insanity defense.

""If the facts are anything near what the allegations are, then we're going to address obvious psychological issues present,"" Talkin said. “We are going to let the dust settle and take a few minutes.""",abcnews.com,True

The suspect's father has also been arrested for the same charges, an Israeli government official said.

Police believe the man made fake bomb threats in New Zealand and Australia and against scores of Jewish institutions across the U.S.

Tina Macintyre-Yee/Democrat and Chronicle/USA TODAY

He also allegedly called in fake bomb threats to two Delta flights at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport in 2015, according to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.

The threats grounded the flights while passengers were evacuated and luggage was rescreened.

The suspect was arrested early this morning in his family's home in the southern city of Ashkelon after a monthslong investigation that included the FBI and European law enforcement agencies, Rosenfeld said. The teenager resisted arrest, Rosenfeld said, explaining that the teen moved toward one of the arresting officers in what is believed to have been an attempt to grab the officer’s sidearm, but the teen never reached the gun.

Israeli police confiscated several computers, antennas, satellite equipment and other advanced technology. Some of the equipment was allegedly used to ""camouflage"" the suspect's voice for automated calls, Rosenfeld said. He added that the suspect also allegedly had equipment that allowed him to use many IP addresses, making it hard to trace him.

Bryan Woolston/Reuters

The suspect appeared in an Israeli court today, and the judge ruled that his identity would not be released until his next court appearance on March 30.

According to an official briefed on the investigation, the suspect had been deemed insufficiently mentally stable to be drafted into the Israeli Army.

The suspect's attorney, Galit Bash, told ABC News in a statement, ""This is a young man without a criminal record who suffers from serious medical problems from a young age. There is a concern that his medical condition affects his cognitive functions. In light of this, we asked the court to order the young man to undergo a medical examination. The court accepted our arguments and ordered the police to examine the young man's medical condition.""

Police have not commented on the teen's motives. It is unclear if he will be tried in Israel or the U.S., police said.

Jerry Silverman, president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America, said it was ""heartbreaking to learn that a Jewish man is a prime suspect.""

Doron Krakow, the president and CEO of the JCC Association of North America, said the organization is ""troubled to learn that the individual suspected of making these threats against Jewish Community Centers — which play a central role in the Jewish community, as well as serve as inclusive and welcoming places for all — is reportedly Jewish.""

He continued, ""Emblematic of the strength of JCCs and the important model they represent for acceptance, inclusion and appreciation for diversity is the remarkable support we have received from communities and community leaders across North America, including civic, political and faith community leaders. Throughout this long running period of concern and disruption that we are hopeful has come to an end, JCCs have had the opportunity to review and assess our security protocols and procedures, and we are confident that JCCs are safer today than ever before.""

Bryan Woolston/Reuters

Gilad Erdan, Israel's minister of public security, said in a statement after reports of the arrest, ""I congratulate the Israeli police on leading a complex international investigation, together with law enforcement agencies from around the world, which led to the arrest of the suspect. We hope that this investigation will help shed light on some of the recent threats against Jewish institutions, which have caused great concern both among Jewish communities and the Israeli government.""

The FBI said in a statement, ""Investigating hate crimes is a top priority for the FBI, and we will continue to work to make sure all races and religions feel safe in their communities and in their places of worship.""

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the arrest ""the culmination of a large-scale investigation spanning multiple continents for hate crimes against Jewish communities across our country.""

""The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate the targeting of any community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs,"" he said in a statement. ""I commend the FBI and Israeli national police for their outstanding work on this case.”

Across the U.S. this year, there have been five waves of bomb threats at JCCs and Jewish schools. The JCC Association of North America reported 100 incidents this year alone. No bombs were found at any of the locations. The FBI and the Justice Department's civil rights division were investigating the incidents.

While the threats were false, Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, told ABC News earlier this month the threats created ""terror"" for the people evacuated from the facilities — including preschool children, the elderly and teenagers — as well as their family members.

Wilfredo Lee/AP Photo

In a statement today he said called the crimes ""acts of anti-Semitism.""

""These threats targeted Jewish institutions, were calculated to sow fear and anxiety and put the entire Jewish community on high alert,"" Greenblatt said. ""Even though it appears that the main culprit behind the majority of these attacks has allegedly been identified, anti-Semitism in the U.S. remains a very serious concern. No arrests have been made in three cemetery desecrations or a series of other anti-Semitic incidents involving swastika graffiti and hate fliers. JCCs and other institutions should not relax security measures or become less vigilant.""

A former journalist arrested in the U.S. earlier this month was accused of making at least eight threats against JCCs, Jewish schools, a Jewish museum and the Anti-Defamation League. The man was not believed to be the main suspect behind this year's rash of bomb threats.

Authorities today identified the suspect as James Harris Jackson, 28, of Maryland, an Army veteran who'd served in Afghanistan.

Assistant Chief Bill Aubry said that Jackson has a deep-seated hatred of black people. Police say he allegedly wrote a manifesto about attacking blacks in New York City.

""It is believed that he was specifically intending to target male blacks for assault,"" he said. ""The reason why he picked New York is because it's the media capital of the world and he wanted to make a statement.""

He is in custody and is being charged with murder, police said. Jackson has not yet entered a plea and is expected to be arraigned this evening.

Police said Jackson had been harboring these feelings toward black males for more than 10 years.

""Based on statements that he made, the subject, as well as a preliminary review of video, it reveals that the attack on [victim] Timothy Caughman was clearly racially motivated,"" Aubry said during a news conference today.

Aubry said Jackson arrived from Baltimore, Maryland, on Friday via BoltBus and then stayed at a Midtown hotel from Friday to Monday afternoon. Aubry said video surveillance footage had captured Jackson wandering through the city.

Police said the fatal stabbing occurred around 11:15 p.m. Monday, as Caughman, a can and bottle recycler, was rifling through the trash.

Police said Jackson walked into a police substation in Times Square a little after midnight today, allegedly saying that he was wanted for a murder that had occurred 24 hours earlier.

Knives were found in his possession, police said. Aubry said police had recovered a 26-inch black mini sword, which investigators believe to be the murder weapon. Aubry said that Jackson did not attack anyone else.

More than 40 tombstones were overturned at Washington Cemetery in the borough's Midwood neighborhood. The NYPD's hate crimes division was notified and investigated the matter. Investigators later said environmental factors and maintenance likely caused the damage, ABC News' New York station WABC reported.

New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind Saturday night tweeted photos of the overturned tombstones, writing that the neighborhood watch group Boro Park Shomrim ""alerted me that stones @ Washington Cemetery are down. I've spoken w/ the NYPD who are investigating. I'll be there in the am.""

In a statement following the investigation, Hikind alluded that the headstones had been targeted for nefarious reasons.

""More than 40 headstones were overturned. These stones were all in the same section where barbed-wire had been cut. Despite the fact that there are thousands upon thousands of graves stretching over many blocks, this was the only section where gravestones had been turned over,"" the statement said. ""This area is less than 5% of the total cemetery grounds.""

""So strong winds hit this section and left the other ones alone? I find that hard to believe. Something is definitely not kosher,"" the statement concluded.

Tomer Hemed, a striker with Brighton & Hove Albion F.C., posted to his social media accounts last week a photo of himself showing a Star of David shaved into his hair.

""Always representing #starofdavid #jewish #israel #proudtobejewish #bhafc,"" wrote Hemed, 29, who is married to model and former Miss Israel Shunit Faragi.

The Community Security Trust, a British charity which monitors anti-Semitic incidents and works with police to gather data, said in January that recorded incidents of anti-Semitism in 2016 had increased by 36 percent from 2015.

British lawmakers have also become increasingly more vocal. Earlier this year, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid, a Conservative, said, ""Anti-Semitism must be understood for what it is -- an attack on the identity of people who live, contribute and are valued in our society.

And at the other end of the political spectrum, the Labour Party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, said, ""We must root out anti-Semitism whenever it takes place and wherever it exists, as a party and as a country.""

Earlier this week, during a parliamentary session, Prime Minister Theresa May also addressed anti-Semitism on university campuses, saying, ""Higher education institutions have a responsibility to ensure that they provide a safe and inclusive environment for all students, and we expect them to have robust policies and procedures in place to comply with the law, to investigate, and to swiftly address [any] hate crime, including any anti-Semitic incidents that are reported.""

http://abcnews.go.com/US/man-accused-making-threats-jewish-community-centers-arrested/story?id=45884069,"A man accused of making at least eight threats against Jewish community centers, Jewish schools, a Jewish museum and the Anti-Defamation League was arrested by the FBI in St. Louis, Missouri, this morning, though the man is not believed to be the main suspect behind this year's rash of bomb threats, two law enforcement officials told ABC News.

Juan Thompson, 31, is accused of what federal prosecutors called a “campaign to harass and intimidate.” He’s charged in New York with cyberstalking a New York City woman by communicating threats in the woman’s name. Prosecutors said Thompson, a former journalist, appears to have made those threats ""as part of a sustained campaign to harass and intimidate” the woman after their romantic relationship ended.

@JuanMThompson/Twitter

He is accused of making threats over the course of Jan. 28 to Feb. 22 against the Anti-Defamation League office in New York, a Jewish history museum in New York, as well as JCCs and Jewish schools in New York, Michigan, Dallas and San Diego.

Law enforcement officials told ABC News Thompson appeared to take advantage of news coverage of the threats in order to exact revenge on a woman who had ended a romantic relationship.

Bric TV/YouTube

Thompson made an initial appearance today in St. Louis and did not enter a plea. His next hearing is scheduled for March 8.

Meanwhile, FBI Director James Comey met with Jewish community leaders today to discuss the recent uptick in threats against Jewish institutions.

#FBI Dir. & sr. execs met w/ community leaders about threats to Jewish institutions & to affirm FBI's commitment to ensure safe communities pic.twitter.com/u07T94T4Jb — FBI (@FBI) March 3, 2017

The FBI said in a statement that ""the investigation into these threats is a top priority"" and that ""agents and analysts across the country are working to identify and stop those responsible.""

""The FBI is committed to ensuring that people of all races and religions feel safe in their communities and places of worship,"" the FBI said.

After Thompson's arrest, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio released a statement, thanking law enforcement ""for aggressively pursuing and arresting a suspect in a disgusting series of threats against Jewish Community Centers. When you attack someone because of who they are, how they worship or who they love, you are attacking our democracy.""

New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill added, ""The defendant caused havoc, expending hundreds of hours of police and law enforcement resources to respond and investigate these threats. We will continue to pursue those who pedal fear, making false claims about serious crimes.""

According to the NYPD, hate crimes are up this year in NYC, driven primarily by anti-Semitic bias crimes.

Thompson's arrest comes after five waves of bomb threats at JCCs and Jewish schools nationwide this year. The JCC Association of North America reported a total of 100 incidents this year alone. No bombs were found at any of the locations. The FBI and the Justice Department's civil rights division are investigating the incidents.

Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, told ABC News earlier this week that JCC threats created ""terror"" for the people evacuated from the facilities — including preschool children, the elderly and teenagers — as well as their family members.

""This is absolutely abnormal, and it is totally unacceptable that anyone, anywhere, at any time could be terrorized because of their faith,"" he said.

The most recent wave -- which did not include any of the threats Thompson is accused of making -- was this past Monday when 31 bomb threats were called into 23 JCCs and eight Jewish day schools in Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington state, and Canada, the JCC Association of North America said. All schools received the all clear from law enforcement, the JCC Association of North America said.

Wilfredo Lee/AP Photo

Karen Kolodny, executive director of the JCC of Mid-Westchester in Scarsdale, New York, one of the 31 centers to receive a threat, told ABC News today that she was expecting to eventually ""be on the target list.""

""We knew at some point it would be our turn,"" she said.

Once the JCC received the phone threat Monday morning, the center -- which includes early childhood programs, senior programs and after school programs -- was evacuated. Police cleared the building within hours and the center reopened. The center has been doing drills for years and teachers undergo training, Kolodny noted.

""We had no indications of fear from the kids, and that's because the teachers are trained to stay calm,"" she said.

To Kolodny, the bomb threat ""was an attempt at harassment and an attempt to disturb the normal routine of average citizens, and we are not going to let it deter us in the operation of our building and in the programs we offer to community ... we won't be harassed.""

She added, ""JCCs are not just Jewish community centers. We are open to and we serve the entire community here. We don't ask for people's religions ... it's not our business. Our doors are open to everyone.""

In the wake of these threats, ""there's so much public outpouring of support for JCCs. If the goal was to destabilize the JCCS, we're still in business, and we're going to continue to be in business. This is a failed attempt at targeting the community and it just won't work,"" Kolodny emphasized.

The JCC in Indianapolis, Indiana, which also received a bomb threat, wrote on Instagram, ""A neighbor stopped by today to say she was thinking of us. Brought dozens of roses for us to share with staff.""

The uptick in anti-Semitism extends beyond bomb threats.

According to Greenblatt, there has been a graffiti at synagogues, a ""tsunami of anti-Semitic slander on social media"" and attacks at Jewish cemeteries.

Since Feb. 20, Jewish cemeteries have been desecrated in University City, Missouri; Philadelphia and Rochester, New York. Authorities are investigating all three cases.

Evan Bernstein, New York regional director at the Anti-Defamation League -- one of the institutions Thompson is accused of targeting -- today thanked law enforcement for Thompson's arrest.

""Just because there's been an arrest ... does not mean the threats have disappeared or will stop,"" she said at a press conference. ""Hate towards the Jewish community and other minority groups is very real and deeply concerning. There is a lot of work that still needs to be done.""

David Posner, the director of strategic performance at the JCC Association of North America, in a statement Monday called on the FBI, the White House, the Justice Department, the Homeland Security Department, Congress and local officials to ""speak out forcefully against this scourge of anti-Semitism"" across the U.S. and to catch the ""perpetrators, who are trying to instill anxiety and fear in our communities.""

On Feb. 21, President Trump for the first time directly addressed recent incidents of anti-Semitism after he received backlash from various groups. Speaking at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., he called the JCC threats a ""painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.""

Attorney General Jeff Sessions told reporters Monday, ""I have seen the Jewish synagogue attacks, threats and things, which is a very serious and disruptive practice. This Department of Justice will do what it can to assist in pushing back against that and prosecuting anybody who was a part of it.""",abcnews.com,True

Gibson was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the New Orleans Police Department.

Gibson, a transgender woman and drag performer, lived in California and was visiting friends in her native New Orleans when she was gunned down, according to ABC affiliate WGNO.

The New Orleans Police Department released images of two people who they believe may have information about Gibson’s death. The individuals are not wanted for the killing but are only wanted for questioning, police said.

Two days later and a few miles away on Columbus Street, responding officers found an “unknown black male” suffering from stab wounds shortly before 9 a.m. local time on Feb. 27. The victim was transported to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries, according to a statement from the New Orleans Police Department.

According to WGNO, the victim was another transgender woman, Ciara McElveen.

Police said video surveillance from the area suggests the victim arrived in a two-door black Chevrolet Camaro with chrome rims.

Witnesses later told detectives they saw a man in a black car leave the vehicle and remove something from the trunk. The man then walked around to the passenger side where he apparently stabbed the victim, police said. The victim was removed from the car and fell to the ground. Witnesses told detectives they then saw the suspect get back in the car and drive off.

The New Orleans Police Department released images of a vehicle of interest in connection with the stabbing death. Authorities are seeking to speak with the vehicle’s owner, as they believe this individual may have information pertinent to the investigation.

Indian Consul General Dr. Anupam Ray met Ian Grillot and his family at the University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, thanking him for his efforts during a Feb. 22 shooting at Austin's Bar & Grill in Olathe, Kansas, in which two Indians living in the U.S. were shot in what the FBI is investigating as a hate crime.

""We will stand with you,"" Ray said after shaking Grillot's hand.

In the February attack, Srinivas Kuchibhotla was fatally shot, while his friend Alok Madasani was wounded. Grillot was the third victim, shot by the gunmen after trying to intervene to stop him.

The alleged shooter, Adam W. Purinton, is currently being held on charges of first-degree murder and two counts of premeditated attempted murder.

During Thursday's meeting, Ray showed Grillot a tweet from India's minister of external affairs praising his actions and saluting his ""heroism."" Ray told Grillot that his bravery was more indicative of the U.S. than the violence that he witnessed in Kansas last month.

major developments from the white house tonight. President trump's first major address to congress and the American people. Generating many headlines for its strikingly different tone, and there was that emotional moment when the president singled out the Navy S.E.A.L. Widow killed in that controversial raid in Yemen. ABC's Jon Karl tonight. Reporter: An upbeat president met with Republican leaders today buzzing about dramatic change in tone in the president's speech last night. Right off the bat, he was reaching out, giving a nod to black history month, and president condemning a recent epidemic of hate crimes he has been slow to acknowledge, including the vandalism of jewish cemeteries and the threats against jewish community centers across the country now being investigated by the FBI. Recent threats targeting jewish community centers and vandalism of jewish cemeteries as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. Reporter: Trump got members of both parties on their feet during the speech's emotional high point, his tribute to Navy S.E.A.L., Ryan Owens, killed in Yemen during the controversial raid. The president approved just a week after he took office. When the president traveled to Dover air force base to witness the return of the fallen S.E.A.L., Owens's father refused to meet with him. But last night his widow was there right next to Ivanka Trump. Ryan died as he lived, a warrior, and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation. Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you. Reporter: The applause lasted for almost a whole two minutes. Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he is very happy because I think he just broke a record. Reporter: And in stark contrast to the combative tone of the president's first weeks in office, a near total reversal, especially this line which could be taken as a criticism of the president himself. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. Reporter: The positive tone was a hit with many critics, amid the good reviews, the white house today abruptly postposed signing a new version of the president's controversial travel ban, something the president has called an urgent matter of national security. But for now, at least, it will wait. A bid, perhaps, to let the big speech moment sink in. Let's get to Jon Karl live at the white house tonight, and Jon, you mention there, the delay now in the president's new executive order. We know at first, it banned citizens from seven muslim-majority countries, and among them, Iraq, and you hear that could come off the list? Reporter: I'm told the current version of the travel ban, Iraq has been removed at the urging of state department officials and defense secretary Mattis who both made the case that Iraq is a critical partner in the fight against ISIS. Including them in the ban could hinder that fight.

Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers. And vandalism. Of Jewish cemeteries. As well as last week shooting in Kansas City. Remind us that while we may be a nation divided and piles. We are a country that stands united. In condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly for. So I struck a walk optimistic tone and he has I think in the past spent. You know people are questioning you know was this theater how Long Will it last went what is this what did you watch what did you find I. So let you put down racism and anti semitism that's optimistic that should be. Do Rivera's they say that's the regular hey come on air into the inaugurations to teach this Liz that was very gloomy and like Warren you know this home was did banner iced. Yes I think that's true act yeah I ask what happened was the likes of Steve batted in the people like Kim were behind the scenes running this very much like a political campaign. And I think Donald Trump and some of the we're moderate people said this isn't working people feel marginalized and I I'm hoping that he realized that. I know he admitted on FOX & Friends the day before or earlier that day that has messaging had been off and he gave himself in a C or C minus in terms of messaging and wondering if there hasn't been some realization that. He may have an agenda that he dean's positive for the country but he's isolating a lot of people this for me was more optimistic I think he should reach across the aisle want policy. I had predicted that he would talk about infrastructure development which is something Democrats often get behind. He talked about paid leave he talked about working like Bob Allen nations need to to fight easily gather against. A lot about Ibaka trumps I think pet projects and yeah that she's been very active in the White House he's taken a lot of originally didn't regret my how he. Paid sentiment cleansed who paid family leave. Yeah Democrats have been yeah I'm very different time it's a much more liberals like it has been at the end while right now it has but I think Republicans many times and he's opposed that and Ibaka had come out supported yet and I were saying it will trump that not only that we saw her hands 500 is a lot it and that's part of that was heartening for what I I. I'm tell yet you know at. That is. Listening to him what he's at. Add to say about hate crimes and things and doesn't matter that hours before he spoke out against the hate crimes. He claimed that some of them could have been committed by people who just want to make him look bad I. And I've got about him that's that's the problem I think with the speech it was a good speech I think he delivered it well he read it on top teleprompter but it's not so much the speech it's what policies that what he's Dowayne behind the scenes. And we know that he east its saint phase when he is unscripted. That are. Are really story and there's a disconnect so on the one hand he doesn't like the crime is going up and he talks about Chicago a lot at the same time he signed signed some kind of legislation that says that mentally ill people showed up and he's having easier access to god yes. So those are the things that Americans need to really think at Anaheim Gadhafi he says that he won he would promote clean Aaron clean water. But then he did tries to dismantle the Clean Water Act. And puts in a guy and the EPA who wants to dismantle them pollute the streams so it doesn't matter what you know I was like don't listen to what he's saying listen to what he's doing yet will he is is that. Up front I didn't I didn't vote for him. But I have been waiting for him to come out and say anything that resembles I'm everyone's president or uniting us. And although I agree that weathered the sincerity was there police hours before he it's and something otherwise. I I'd rather have him do something like this than what he's been doing which is doubling down on stupid stuff that he said. I don't care he's faking it let's fake it until we start let me change it's you that if it thought it was a it was better now that he's been a group. For me it is just you know when you come out of the gate. You know and you start bets you he started that you know he started started with the Mexicans and rapists and not. And when you double down you're going to go what you get all the backing from the white supremacist groups and you don'ts today. Right as soon as it happens not know I'm not I'm just about that yes. And it takes you four MR. To talk about the fact that Jewish cemeteries and and that JC seize up being. Bombarded by people who are. What essentially field they have been given the right to dig that's why do you the president on her I need I don't need it Kansas Saint Louis. You know but that's family that it you know why I've gotten said he listens to me and believes in what I believed killed two people. He mentioned it briefly it down the gossip says he's a supporter of mine I'm not a supporter of his that was horrific and it Nellis families. Had been and that gallery also. I might feel a little bit like okay you are start again at MI but because when somebody's dust up in your name. That's what she just about all south. I don't make that big dive in make that a I don't know what I said yeah heart is gonna change I've said this before it that majority of his speeches thus far in talks in wanted to be about Atmel. You aren't only spoken to him what I voice heard as it's not that he's against these groups he doesn't get an apathy towards them because if you worked for candid. He's not for you he continues to speak for the people that supported him acts I don't think he's going to change his heart all the sudden having embedded EA he doesn't act that he. Doesn't have a hard is it fair to say anything you can't have a heart I I said a change of heart I'm not expecting him to all of a sudden he still up lake. It disgusted by some things that happens out I don't think that's gonna change that and I think that. I'm saying that Exxon or of the right light wage and this was a step in the right direction. No I don't unbiased consumer policy though I'm I'm seeing sun lot of policy. I mean I did I heard with respect to eight you know border security act. I think we hear specifics well here's nothing articulate or know that land sales allegations in this and you don't get its act like they're not like to hear more specifics but. With respect to immigration I've been hearing that there's been a shift where he may actually looking into granting legal status to undocumented people who are here with not an if I had not today in this yesterday about it. There are some been some internal circulation out there. I don't think Donald Trump is a hard right kind of guy I do think inside internally if you listen to past statements he made before he ran for president this time.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/communities-cope-recent-anti-semitic-attacks-jewish-officials/story?id=45800345,"After tombstones were found toppled at Jewish cemeteries in Missouri and Pennsylvania and nearly 100 Jewish Community Centers and schools nationwide received bomb threats, Jewish leaders are urging President Trump to take action.

On Monday, 21 bomb threats were called in to 13 JCCs and eight Jewish schools in Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia, the JCC Association of North America said. No bombs were found at any locations.

There have been 90 incidents this year alone, at 73 locations in 30 states and one Canadian province, the JCC Association said. The FBI and the Justice Department's civil rights division are investigating.

While the threats were false, Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, told ABC News the threats created ""terror"" for the people evacuated from the facilities — including preschool children, the elderly and teenagers — as well as their family members.

""This is absolutely abnormal, and it is totally unacceptable that anyone, anywhere, at any time could be terrorized because of their faith,"" he said.

David Posner, the director of strategic performance at the JCC Association of North America, told ABC News that as far as the organization knows, ""the FBI has not yet determined who the perpetrators are, so we do not yet know what their motives are."" But he added that he sees a ""general rise in the level of intolerance in this nation now, and I think it gives the feeling that people can act with greater impunity.""

Besides bomb threats, two Jewish cemeteries have been vandalized in one week. On Feb. 20, over 100 tombstones were found overturned at the Chesed Shel Emeth Society cemetery in University City, Missouri. On Sunday in Philadelphia, over 100 headstones were discovered toppled and cracked at the city's Mount Carmel Cemetery. Authorities are investigating both cases.

Rabbi Yosef Goldman of Philadelphia's Temple Beth Zion–Beth Israel recalled seeing ""row upon row of toppled tombstones"" at Mount Carmel Cemetery.

""Many of them weighed several hundred pounds,"" he said. ""What I saw was devastating.""

Steve Rosenberg, an official with the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia who visited the cemetery, said, ""It was clearly a deliberate act of violence and desecration.""

""It took a lot of effort and intention to commit this crime ... Headstones are very heavy, and some of them are gigantic — the size of a car,"" he added. ""This had to be a group of people that were here for a long time.""

The Philadelphia Police Department announced Tuesday that the rewards for information leading to an arrest and conviction had risen to a total of $50,000, from an initial $13,000: the Anti-Defamation League, through the Mizel Family Foundation, is offering a $10,000 reward; councilman Allan Domb is offering a $12,000 reward, mayor Jim Kenney is offering a $15,000 reward, an anonymous donor is offering a $10,000 reward, and the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5 is offering a $3,000 Reward for information leading to an arrest only.

Greenblatt said the anti-Semitism extends beyond cemetery vandalism and threats to JCCs to graffiti at synagogues and a ""tsunami of anti-Semitic slander on social media.""

Religious attacks in the past week were also aimed at the Muslim community; investigators said a fire at a Florida mosque on Feb. 24 was intentionally set.

Goldman and Greenblatt, who both noted a surge of anti-Semitism and hate crimes since the presidential election, pointed to the role of the Trump administration.

""We have not seen — until last week — our political leadership speak out in a strong way against these incidents,"" Greenblatt said.

When anti-Semitism was not immediately condemned by the White House, ""extremists felt emboldened,"" he added.

""Words have consequences, and a lack of words have consequences,"" he said.

On Feb. 21, Trump for the first time directly addressed recent incidents of anti-Semitism after he received backlash from various groups. Speaking at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., he called the recent JCC threats a ""painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.""

While Goldman said ""it will take more than a single statement"" from Trump ""to show that he is serious about combating the rise of anti-Semitism,"" Greenblatt said the president's statement was ""really appreciated.""

He added, ""Now is the time to move from words to action. Now is the time for our leaders to not only speak out but to step up and apply the full force of the federal government to addressing anti-Semitism ... We're prepared to work with the administration to help make that happen.""

Vice President Mike Pence visited the desecrated Missouri cemetery last week and condemned the act.

MO's people are inspiring the nation w/ their compassion for the Jewish community. Thank you for showing the world what America is all about pic.twitter.com/PWTFLGqqz0 — Vice President Pence (@VP) February 22, 2017

In a statement Monday, Posner of the JCC Association called on the FBI, the White House, the Justice Department, the Homeland Security Department, Congress and local officials to ""speak out forcefully against this scourge of anti-Semitism"" across the U.S. and to catch the ""perpetrators, who are trying to instill anxiety and fear in our communities.""

Attorney General Jeff Sessions told reporters Monday, ""I have seen the Jewish synagogue attacks, threats and things, which is a very serious and disruptive practice. This Department of Justice will do what it can to assist in pushing back against that and prosecuting anybody who was a part of it.""

Goldman said he prayed Sunday evening among the desecrated graves in Philadelphia but remains full of hope. He was joined by members of the community, including Muslims, Christians and a Quaker.

""In the Jewish tradition,"" Goldman said, ""the greatest act of love and kindness one can show is to see to the needs of the dead. It was touching to see all of these people show up to do whatever they could on behalf of those who were laid to rest.""

""It was extremely moving,"" he said. ""Faith amidst the darkness.""

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lines-remember-trumps-joint-address/story?id=45801702,"President Donald Trump offered his vision for the country in his first address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday evening.

Touching on many of the keystones of his presidential campaign, such as immigration from Mexico, national security and job growth, Trump delivered a more optimistic message than he has in other public appearances, notably sticking to his prepared remarks for almost the entirety of the speech.

Here are seven memorable moments from Trump's first joint address:

""Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.""

After facing widespread criticism from Democrats in recent weeks over his perceived silence on threats against the country's Jewish community and an alleged hate crime in Kansas in which a man told two bar patrons to ""get out of my country"" before shooting them and killing one, Trump addressed the incidents at the start of his speech, calling for unity against hate and evil.

""We will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border. As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak and as I promised throughout the campaign.""

Trump returned to one of his original campaign promises, telling Congress that construction on the border wall would begin ""soon."" What Trump did not mention however, is how the wall will be paid for. He consistently told crowds during the campaign that Mexico would foot the bill for the wall, but the country has denied that they will pay. In recent weeks, Trump said that the U.S. may have to pay at first before seeking reimbursement from Mexico.

""My administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe -- and to keep those out who will do us harm.""

The president teased at the issuance of a new executive order limiting travel and immigration into the U.S. After Trump's earlier order blocking entry from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was halted by a federal judge earlier in the month, the White House said that a new order has been ""finalized."" ABC News has learned that the order is expected to be announced Wednesday.

""Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better healthcare.""

Another of Trump's campaign promises, to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- known informally as Obamacare -- made an appearance during the address. On Monday, Trump noted that ""nobody knew that health care could be so complicated,"" as the Republican-controlled house and senate continue to deliberate ways to make changes to the landmark legislation.

""The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.""

In a moment that raised a few eyebrows and produced some laughs on social media, Trump seemed to state the obvious: if health care costs were lowered, it would be easier for more people to acquire.

""We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William 'Ryan' Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero -- battling against terrorism and securing our nation.

I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, 'Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.' Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you.

Ryan is looking down right now and I think he’s very happy because I think he just broke a record.""

The evening's most emotional moment came as Trump introduced the wife of Navy SEAL chief petty officer William ""Ryan"" Owens, who was killed a month ago during a raid in Yemen. While Owens' father has made news in recent days for telling the Miami Herald that he refused to meet with Trump when his son's body was flown back to the U.S., his widow Carryn appeared at the Capitol.

After Trump pushed back on calls for an investigation into the raid by invoking Defense Secretary James Mattis' view of the mission as ""highly successful,"" the body gave Carryn Owens a standing ovation lasting almost two minutes, which the president said he believed ""broke a record.""

""The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams into action.""

Trump concluded his marks with an optimistic message, calling for an end to ""trivial fights."" Many observers noted after the speech that Trump himself seems to revel in those fights and that the White House has instigated many of them.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-set-make-biggest-speech-joint-address/story?id=45787395,"President Donald Trump delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, addressing a host of familiar themes from his campaign and calling for unity to address a litany of issues that he says are plaguing the country.

Trump's call for an end to the ""pure unadulterated division"" and ""trivial fights"" comes in the wake of a bruising campaign and a tumultuous start to his presidency, squaring off against critics as well as waging a pitched battle against the media. The speech also comes amid a flurry of questions about alleged contacts between Trump associates and suspected Russian officials, which the president has derided as ""fake news.""

""The time for small thinking is over,"" Trump said. ""The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.""

Trump began the address by condemning the recent threats against Jewish centers and a suspected hate crime in Kansas. The president had drawn fire for not immediately addressing the Jewish Community Center incidents and not making public comments about the fatal Kansas shooting until tonight's speech.

""Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms,"" Trump said.

One of the most emotional moments -- and possibly the longest standing ovation of the speech -- came when Trump praised Carryn Owens, the widow of Senior Chief William ""Ryan"" Owens who died in a raid in Yemen. The moment has been a political hot point since Owens' father Bill Owens and Sen. John McCain criticized the president's choice to execute the mission. but Trump used the speech to call it ""a highly successful raid.""

During the speech, Trump revisited what he called the movement that propelled him into the White House.

""In 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet,"" he said. ""The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -– families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns. But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus -- as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.""

""Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people,"" Trump said.

Alex Wong/Getty Images

Trump ran through a series of his biggest campaign promises during much of the speech, giving updates on what he and his team plan to do about them. He talked about how ""we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border,"" and later talked about plans for ""a new program of national rebuilding.""

His call for Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare was met with one of the loudest responses, with Republicans standing while some Democrats were seen giving a thumbs down.

He made a push for unity later in the speech, saying that ""everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.""

""Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more – so why not join forces and finally get the job done? And get it done right. On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people,"" he said.

Trump touched on paid family leave, the need to make childcare more affordable, an effort to promote clean air and water -- all issues that his daughter Ivanka has reportedly championed -- as areas where Republicans and Democrats could work together, along with rebuilding the military and the country's infrastructure.

Alex Wong/Getty Images

He went on to call education ""the civil rights issue of our time"" before asking Congress to fund an education bill that allows children school choice.

""Our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind – and the souls – of every American child,"" he said.

While Trump did talk about his administration's plans to build a ""great, great"" wall, a regular theme of his campaign, he did not talk about who would pay for it; he said regularly during the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall and he has since wavered about when and by whom those payments would be made.

First Lady Melania Trump attended the speech along with hand-picked guests, including Maureen Scalia, the widow of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner, who is a senior advisor to the president, were also seated in the first lady's box.

A group of female House Democrats all chose to wear white in an act of support for women's rights. Their sartorial choice was particularly noticeable because they all sat together in the chamber.

On Feb. 22, police in Olathe responded to a 911 call of shots fired at Austin's Bar and Grill, about 20 miles southwest of Kansas City, Kansas, authorities said.

The shooting killed Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, and injured Alok Madasani, 32, and Ian Grillot, 24.

Kuchibhotla died after he was taken to a local hospital, authorities said.

Adam W. Purinton was arrested in the early morning hours on Thursday in Clinton, Missouri, and was being held on $2 million bond. He waived extradition and was transported back to Olathe on Friday.

He has been charged with one count of premeditated murder and two counts of premeditated attempted murder, according to the Johnson County District Attorney's Office.

It was unclear if Purinton had entered a plea. His listed attorney, Johnson County public defender Michelle Durrett, did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

President Trump has not addressed the shooting publicly, but the White House today condemned the shooting.

""It begins to look like this was an act of racially motivated hatred,"" White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said in an off-camera briefing today. ""The president condemns these and any other racially and religiously motivated attacks in the strongest terms. They have no place in our country, and we will continue to make that clear.""

In an interview from his hospital bed, Grillot said he took cover until he thought the shooter's gun was empty.

""I got up and proceeded to chase him down, try to subdue him,"" Grillot said in a video posted online by the University of Kansas Health System. ""I got behind him, and he turned around and fired a round at me.""

Grillot said he was hit in the hand and the chest and the bullet narrowly missed a major artery. A bartender said the shooter used ""racial slurs"" just before firing inside the bar, The Associated Press reported.

ANI/via Reuters TV

Kuchibhotla, who immigrated to the U.S. from India in 2005 and resided in Olathe, worked as an engineer at Garmin. On Friday his wife described him as a hard-working man who loved America and ""did not deserve a death like this.""

Jose Torres, 26, and Kayla Norton, 25, cried today in a Douglas County court as they were sentenced to 20 years and 15 years in prison, respectively.

In July 2015, Torres and Norton, who have three children together, were part of a group of Confederate flag supporters called Respect the Flag. For two days that summer, the group rode around in pickup trucks threatening black families and calling them racial slurs across two counties in the Atlanta suburbs.

The group targeted black families shortly after the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre because its members were upset that the state responded to the brutal slayings by removing the Confederate battle flag from various sites.

At one point, the group pulled up to a birthday party for a black child in Douglasville. The group's members allegedly threatened to kill the partygoers, with Torres confronting the family with a gun that Norton loaded. The family called the police.

Video of the incident was posted on YouTube by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

In an indictment, Torres and Norton, among others, were charged with aggravated assault, terroristic threats and violation of Georgia's Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act.

During their sentencing today, the judge said their actions ""were motivated by racial hatred,"" according to The Associated Press.

Through tears, Norton addressed the relatives of the child whose birthday she and others disrupted.

""That is not me. That is not me. That is not him,"" Norton said in court after her sentencing. ""I would never walk up to you and say those words to you. And I am so sorry that happened to you.""

In addition to Torres and Norton, two people were charged with felonies, according to ABC affiliate WSB-TV.com; the two others pleaded guilty and were sentenced to shorter prison terms.

Ian Grillot, 24, intervened to stop a gunman who witnesses said yelled ""get out of my country"" before shooting two Indian men in Olathe, Kansas last Wednesday, killing one.

Adam Purinton, a 51-year-old Navy veteran and former air traffic controller, is being charged with murder and attempted murder in the shooting that killed Srinivas Kuchibhotla and wounded Alok Madasani, both 32-year-old employees of the technology company Garmin.

Authorities are investigating if the shooting was a hate crime. Purinton is being held on a $2 million bond and is scheduled make his first court appearance on Monday.

“This is a very bad way of it happening, but, I'm so grateful that it is actually bringing the community together instead of driving them apart,"" Grillot said in an interview posted on the University of Kansas Hospital's YouTube page on Sunday. “It is such a beautiful thing. I love it.

“I was more than happy to risk my life to save the lives of others,” Grillot said. “I thank everybody for drawing together and supporting me and the other families affected by this.”

Grillot said he is recovering from gunshot wounds to his hand and chest. He said he was “doing a lot better,” but still sore and feeling the aftermath from “the bullet lodged in my ribs.”

People traveled from as far as India and Washington, D.C. to attend a prayer vigil for Kuchibhotla and the other victims in Olathe on Sunday.

Representative Kevin Yoder (R-Kan) attended the vigil and posted about it on his Instagram account, calling the incident a ""great tragedy"" and saying ""thousands of concerned citizens came together to support one another and the Indian community.""

He also urged people to remember Kuchibhotla’s life as well as Grillot’s “heroism.”

Many of the vigil’s attendees, including Mike Johns of Olathe, said they were there to rally for peace.

“This isn’t Selma, but this is close,” Johns told ABC affiliate KMBC on Sunday. “We’re marching, just like Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] did, for peace.“

Sunayana Dumala said her husband, shooting victim Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, arrived in the U.S. from India in 2005 to pursue a master's degree at the University of Texas at El Paso.

Dumala said not long after that, she and her husband moved to Kansas and ""made Olathe their home,"" and Kuchibhotla continued to ""succeed"" in the aviation industry, which he was passionate about.

On the night of shooting, Kuchibhotla was just doing ""the same thing"" he always does -- enjoying a glass of beer to get rid of his ""work stress"" and have a ""fun time with his friend,"" Dumala said, speaking at a news conference.

According to Dumala, Kuchibhotla and his friends were ""minding their own business"" when a man began harassing them over their race. The managers of the bar kicked the man out, but he came back, Dumala said.

""He has taken a life -- a very lovable soul -- from everyone,"" Dumala said.

The couple's families are ""in grief,"" she said, noting that her husband would have turned 33 on March 9.

Dumala said she had expressed concerns with her husband about shootings in the U.S. and wondered if they should stay in the country.

When she expressed those concerns, she said he would he would tell her, “Good things happen in America.”

Kuchibhotla's brothers also spoke publicly today, urging authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter, which they said they believed was not a random incident.

The Indian government ""should voice out this strongly [to U.S. authorities] because our brothers, sisters and our relatives are there,"" Venu Madhav, a brother of Kuchibhotla, told South Asian news agency Asian News International (ANI) today.

Madhav suggested to ANI that he believed the incident was not just a random shooting, saying, that ""if you really look into this incident, this is not done by a teenager or a burglar, or something like that [or] a drug addict. It is [allegedly] done by a [51-year-old] man.""

Another brother to Kuchibhotla, K.K. Shastri, told ANI that he wants authorities to release Kuchibhotla's body to the family overseas as soon as possible.

""We want the body to be here at the earliest,"" Shastri said. ""We are waiting.""

As the brothers spoke to reporters outside of their home in India, other relatives of Kuchibhotla were seen on video mourning quietly in the home, including one woman who was wiping away tears.

Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies in the U.S. are investigating whether the shooting that left Kuchibhotla dead was a hate crime.

The shooting happened at the Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas, on Wednesday evening, according to authorities.

A bartender said that the shooter used ""racial slurs"" just before firing inside the bar, The Associated Press reported.

The FBI is investigating whether the shooting was a bias crime, according to Kansas City FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Eric Jackson. He said that the FBI was going to investigate ""from every angle to ""determine what the true facts are.""

Local police added that they would also look into whether the shooting was racially motivated.

The shooting killed Kuchibhotla and injured two others -- Alok Madasani, 32, and Ian Grillot, 24, officials said.

Madasani and Grillot were taken to a local hospital where they were listed in stable condition, officials said.

The suspect, Adam W. Purinton, fled after the shooting, according to Olathe Police Chief Steven Menke.

Purinton was found and arrested early the following morning in Clinton, Missouri, and charged with one count of premeditated murder and two counts of premeditated attempted murder, according to Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe.

Purinton is being held on a $2 million bond, Howe said.

Purinton has waived extradition and an attorney has not been formally assigned to Purinton because he has not yet appeared in court, the AP reported today.

The triple-shooting has shaken many, both in the U.S. and in India.

""I am very disturbed by last night's shooting in Olathe,"" Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran said in a statement. ""I strongly condemn violence of any kind, especially if it is motivated by prejudice and xenophobia.""

http://abcnews.go.com/US/fire-florida-mosque-investigated-arson/story?id=45711657,"Officials believe an early morning fire at a mosque in Florida was intentionally set, and the incident is being investigated as a hate crime.

The Hillsbourgh County Fire Rescue received a call around 2:09 a.m. local time Friday about a fire at the Islamic Society of New Tampa in Thonotosassa. Firefighters put out the blaze and no one was hurt, though the building, commonly referred to as the New Tampa Mosque, suffered some property damage, officials said.

Officials and mosque members said it appears someone tried to break into the building. There are marks on the door, which is locked every night when the mosque closes.

Authorities will review footage from surveillance cameras that are installed throughout the property. The investigation is ongoing.

CAIR Florida/Facebook

Officials from CAIR Florida, the state’s largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization, held a news conference with officials outside the mosque this morning. Members of the mosque told reporters they’ve already received incredible support on social media and from the community.

Wilfredo Amr Ruiz, an attorney and the communications director for CAIR Florida, called the fire a “hate crime” and an “act of terror.”

""We congratulate the Hillsborough County first responders for their prompt response to this tragic situation. It is worrisome that our community have fallen victim of what appears to be another hate crime,” Ruiz said in a statement today. “CAIR-Florida urgently call [sic] all local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to be on top of the investigation of what appears to be a heinous act of terror against the Muslim community.”

Due to the ongoing investigation, there will be no Friday prayer at the mosque today. All regular prayers will be held in the old mosque building, according to a press release from the Islamic Society of New Tampa.

On Wednesday evening, police responded to a 911 call of shots fired at Austin's Bar and Grill in Olathe, about 20 miles southwest of Kansas City, Kansas, said Olathe Police Chief Steven Menke.

The suspect, Adam W. Purinton, was arrested in the early morning hours on Thursday in Clinton, Missouri, and is being held on $2 million bond, said Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe. Purinton fled the scene of the shooting, according to Menke.

Authorities said the perpetrator of the attack shot Alok Madasani and Srinivas Kuchibhotla, both 32, and Ian Grillot, 24.

All three victims were taken to a local hospital, where Kuchibhotla died, Menke said, adding that authorities have been in contact with all the victims' families. The other two victims are in stable condition, Menke said.

Kuchibhotla worked as an engineer at Garmin.

""I am very disturbed by last night's shooting in Olathe,"" read a statement from Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran. ""I strongly condemn violence of any kind, especially if it is motivated by prejudice and xenophobia.""

Grillot said in an interview from his hospital bed that after the shooting started, he took cover until he thought the shooter's gun was empty.

""I got up and proceeded to chase him down, try to subdue him,"" Grillot said in a video posted online by the University of Kansas Health System. ""I got behind him, and he turned around and fired a round at me.""

Grillot said he was hit in the hand and the chest, and that the bullet narrowly missed a major artery.

""I was told I was incredibly lucky for what happened to me,"" Grillot said. ""I could have never walked again or seen my family again.""

Purinton has been charged with one count of premeditated murder and two counts of premeditated attempted murder, Howe said. It will be up to Clinton County to decide whether to waive extradition, he added.

Howe would not disclose the type of weapon used in the attack, which he described as a ""pretty traumatic event in a very open, public situation.""

It is unclear if Purinton has retained a lawyer.

Patrons were watching a basketball game between the University of Kansas and Texas Christian University before the shooting, which began after 7 p.m., The Associated Press reported.

The FBI is investigating whether the shooting was a bias crime, said Kansas City FBI special agent in charge Eric Jackson. Local police will aid in the investigation.

Jackson said FBI personnel are investigating from every angle to ""determine that the true facts are.""

Authorities were unable to provide further details in the case.

""We've got a lot of work to do,"" Howe said.

Wow. A guy it's all on her aunt. Sweden this weekend. Yeah and have you know whole game impassioned speech about how to blow wolves. It's courage that immigrants as rocket land that act he act and abduct an eight mop Bragman perhaps that I take it. You look at what's happening in Germany. You look at what's happening last night in sweeten. Sweep. Who would believe as Sweden. They took get a large numbers there have been problems like they've never thought. So a lot of people weren't sure exactly what he was talking about including everyone initially yeah. Even the former prime minister asked to even smoking a pack yeah. Yeah a day late hour the but. I don't know this is the problem that bit I had with it. If you only want I had never let me I had sever. Brooke but the report he documentary it was based on these interviews with police officers are Sweden. Those police officers has could have come forward and they said quote it was supposed to be about crime at high risk areas there wasn't a focus. A migration or immigration and we were answering completely different questions in the interview. This is bad journalism so trump likes it's up about fake news while he based his statement. On fake news that was based on fake journalism yet so this is unbelievable asked Connolly Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News maybe Tucker should be his national security advisor. I'm very spot that would be about I Bud Light until prevent that. He did while Tucker did a follow up segment on it actually I from the issue was that he didn't he made it sound like there was an incident of terrorism that happened in Sweden if he wanted to talk about Germany want to talk about the influx of refugees many who. Don't have background checks will be responsible for for violent crimes and deaths of people in Germany if you wanted to even talk about Sweden. And the issues that exist in Sweden Sweden has the highest number of Islamic state fighters per capita in Europe there has been input on what the chant listen. What he put out there was a lot there haven't been incidents of sweetness sweeter said what the howling while our I didn't. No we I'm not read this we are saying to him what are you talking about talking about that because he made it sound like there was an incident last night in Sweden does what he said which is incorrect you want to talk about rapes increasing in Sweden if you wanna talk about issues. You can put the needs that day and Jeff Bennett and now. There is not a fact that an errant priests and I'm no significant increase in nine to 2052. Dozen is sixteen and in fact the only type of crime in Sweden. That is undeniable we spiked. 3272013. To five went what I did say his dealings and this this documentary that he decided to quote from people are backing up another people are saying you statistics aren't right. He needed to say that's where he had gotten his information it and wants to bring up these issues much like the god who did the documentary I think he's entitled to do Japanese not an idol to say. There was an event that happened last night in Sweden you have to say look we need time and I hate crimes simply Tunisia remaining Muslims he should not. He shouldn't identity or when he lied to so. Here's the tragedy of the way he lives in May accept these stories 40% of two from 47% of each from voters. A new only 47% of term but what if voters knew that Frederick tell the Douglas was dead that he died you know. That they don't know they don't already half of charm voters believe the Bowling Green massacre actually happens. So that his he's always lying and is based half of them believe it to that is the problem can happens every pilot crashed. I had nothing I like I had let him that I that I had with the story was that. After that group the and sneaking out which he was grouping it with a bunch of terrorist attacks with a misleading at best. Tucker Carlson Condit defended it and said. Quote the president ought to be precise and when he says there should be no confusion about what he means kinda saying get over the logistics but I find this dangerous to. When you're talking about Paris 130 people died niece 86 died Brussels 32 died in Germany grueling twelve died. You're grouping in an immigration problem facts are not. And your sweet bean you in with major terrorist attacks Biden that's what that tells equivalent that he's just tacking on. Happened he mentioned one in Sweden and when you look closer it was about smoked in in out T out. Baton Beijing they ruled had nothing to do with terror has yet to even loosely putting these incidents out there and just talking if you win and these are major problem making people afraid of immigrants mount etc. that's what this is all about let's put it well you know want to listen the hull. This solving this weekend you know forgive me I'm in it will be cost so dense. Where mom great movie. Thank you have been. Sally Field as a soap operas. When she gets full blessing is now as she needs some support it just so I say let's go to programs. Well I think staying back and said the same thing this weekend let's go to Florida and yeah because. That's what it looked like 101000 he was saying yeah you're gonna do you're on the man. But it doesn't how. If you don't have your facts you glad your facts and even act I would say even chumps supporters at some point are gonna say well. You know we really want to do this. But we want you to do it legally we want to do this the way you're supposed to wait because you bits about how you said everything Obama does what did was not legal that. You can join the same somewhere and it went isn't it goes back to last week one does when this make news. Become fake news. Well eyewitness I think he Haston. Be careful of how he worst thing you could have a conversation about refugees and you can even have a conversation about whether or not influx of refugees in certain countries with their not. Then it with a background checks don't exist whether that policy has negatively affected that country what you can't do is cite some sort of documentary without saying so. And then pretend there was an incident in Sweden last night that doesn't work for anyone either side. I want simple as I don't know I was into was. I did not affect ticket when embarrass floating out what's he smoking he also sad we're used to seeing the president at US as one of the most well informed persons in the world. Also well aware of the importance of what he said and then suddenly you see him engaging in this information. And slander against actually friendly country obviously relying on sources of a quality that best could be described as dubious he technique and he's still takes on Australia picks on Sweden and it is still loves Russia so much. That's that's the thing about him. And here and a romance everybody's having fights with everybody else has been a friend he had to fork and a lot of and I just lawyers feel like. Then he's been cheering for him because they're baffled by the media backlash that he's getting may see a very successful president who's making good. Watch his campaign promise right I just don't clean water air. Nobody thought could be voting. Not fair to say that's what I'm talking point people so Republicans don't like clean water or air that's not true there's a lot of people keep my eye is against the magic and you haven't Ugly Betty yeah country nor trying gives. I'm Steve regulated he just alleged dumping in aren't sure a lot of thunderstorms at their house do you balance because a lot of that excessive regulation puts a lot of people out of work and mostly well undecided I don't know I don't know anybody I can't I haven't let me family all companies are pulled up into my parents present lobby. EPH was still rampant because companies were not looking out for their workers that's why.

Pop culturists know Britney spears has provided as much interest offstage as on. Scintillating relationships and offbeat haircuts raised tons of fan speculation. Now we can relive it all through upcoming unauthorized lifetime bio-pic. Here's ABC's Nick watt. ??? ??? hit me baby one more time ??? Reporter: That is one of the biggest-selling singles of all-time. And Britney an idol ever since Mickey mouse clubhouse days. Later won the heart of the late '90s power denim power couple. Her debut album one of the best selling everybody by a teenaged artist. ??? You drive me crazy ??? ??? I just can't sleep I'm so excited I'm in too deep ??? Reporter: Ten years ago, almost to the day, Britney spears shaved her own head in a California salon. The implosion of an interplanetary pop princess. Recreated in ""Britney ever after"" premiering Saturday night, where else but lifetime. Natasha basset is Britney. Having tried to get inside her head, what do you think she was going through? I think she got into something at a very young age that almost cannibalized her. Reporter: She went all red leather raunchy. ??? I'm not that innocent ??? Reporter: Oops. An early smash, Britney was just 18 years old. Seeing her as sort of a prisoner of celebrity, she can't go anywhere, can't do anything without having protection, you know. It's like living in a glass box. You're not trashing her in this? No, no, absolutely not. This is a love letter to Britney. Reporter: But still a totally unauthorized bio-pic. A spears spokesperson telling us, Britney will not be contributing to the project in any way, shape or form, nor does it have her blessing. How did that play in the back of your mind? It's always difficult to play someone who's still with us and can view the work you're doing. You just want to do them justice. Reporter: In the pantheon of stars given the lifetime movie treatment, Whitney, Anna Nicole Smith, Aaliyah, most have passed. For me in the sense because it was unauthorized I didn't find it as challenging. I didn't have to stay true to exactly what's going on. It was impressionistic. Guess what, mama? I'm married. Reporter: This is Natasha bass basset's actual audition tape. Our idea wasn't necessarily to find a carbon copy of her, it was to find an actor who could embody her essence. I don't think we resemble each other a great deal. Reporter: Bassett is Australian. I want to be alone! How did you do the Louisiana accent? You're from Sydney. I played her interviews all the time. The minute I found out I was playing Britney spears, I went into her accent right away. Reporter: Also studying Britney's more difficult days, like this 2006 ""Dateline"" interview. You have to realize that we're people. That we just need privacy. And we need our respect. If it was a darker time in her life I'd just be crying every time I watched an interview. Reporter: 2007 VMAs performance, another sign something was very wrong. I had no desire to recreate that moment. There's no way I could. I decided that it really was a feeling. And if we could come at it visceral, feel what she's feeling, then it would be interesting. It's right here. Reporter: The movie centers on spears' relationship with Justin Timberlake, played by Nathan keys. It's young love, star-crossed lovers, Romeo and Juliet. It's a story we can all relate to. Excuse me, can I see the playback? Reporter: Potential career suicide for a young actor. What? I look horrible! You saw me like that! I did have my doubts at first. But it was when I read the script that I decided, no, I have to do this film, I want to tell this story. Why? Because it's a showing of strength. I think it's a feminist story at its core. ??? I love rock 'N' roll ??? Reporter: Feminist Phoenix. From this -- ??? I love rock 'N' roll ??? Reporter: To hell. The Timberlake breakup. It's not what you think. You and me, we're done. It's not like that, Justin! Reporter: The Kevin federline marriage. He makes me so happy, I want to spend the rest of my life with him. Reporter: Remember, spears isn't cooperating. You made the movie without using any of her own music. That's right. We couldn't. We got the rights to songs she had performed. ??? I love rock 'N' roll ??? Ah. We have the girls who auditioned for Britney sing 80 love rock 'N' roll"" in the audition acapella. This movie hasn't come out and already people have strong opinions. Of course, of course. I mean, the two of the most iconic pop stars of all-time suddenly the subject of a film, and they're so beloved. There was a section of the internet that is already, having not seen it, saying, I hate this, this is awful. I stay away from it. Reporter: Some tweets, #rip, who told lifetime it was okay, a hate crime, trash, cringe-worthy but I still really want to watch it. Will you read them after it airs? No. I don't really need to know if the people hated what I did. It's more about who Britney spears is as a human being. Not just a performer. Surprise!

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/man-arrested-fbi-threatening-dylann-roof-style-attack/story?id=45555800,"A man with a felony record in South Carolina purchased a gun from an undercover FBI agent with the intention of carrying out an attack in ""the spirit of Dylann Roof,"" authorities said Thursday.

Benjamin McDowell, 29, who had allegedly become affiliated with white supremacist gangs during his time in prison, purchased a .40 caliber Glock handgun and ammunition, according to an affidavit filed by FBI agent Grant Lowe.

According to the complaint, McDowell was arrested in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina shortly after purchasing the weapon and charged as a felon in possession of a firearm.

The agent said that McDowell had made unspecified threats, once telling Lowe that he might shoot at a gathering of black people.

Authorities began investigating McDowell in December after he threatened a local synagogue on Facebook. Several days later, he again posted to Facebook, complaining that white supremacists were often unwilling to act on their convictions.

""All they wanne (sic) do is stay loaded on drugs the Jews put here to destroy white man and they feast on the drugs. they should be Feasting on the enemy that stole their Heritage and their bloodline and trying to run us off of this Earth,"" McDowell wrote. ""if you ain't got the heart to fight for Yahweh like dylann roof did, you need to shut the f--- up.""

On or about Jan. 6, 2017, according to the complaint, McDowell had requested an ""iron,"" a code word for a gun, over Facebook Instant Messenger.

Court records show that since 2008, McDowell's criminal record included charges for assault and burglary. It also said local authorities had kept tabs on him prior to December because of the alleged white supremacist connections he had made in prison.

Dylann Roof was sentence to death last month for the 2015 massacre of 9 black worshipers at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina.",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-cited-report-finding-increase-domestic-hate-groups/story?id=45529218,"A nearly three-fold increase in the number of anti-Muslim hate groups last year contributed to an overall rise in the number of hate groups in the United States for the second year in a row, according the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).

The number of anti-Muslim hate groups jumped to 101 last year from 34 in 2015 “as the radical right was energized by the candidacy of Donald Trump,” according to the SPLC, a legal advocacy group that monitors extremism in the United States.

Overall, the number of domestic hate groups rose to 917 last year, from 892 in 2015, or about 3 percent, the Montgomery, Alabama-based center said in its annual report, contained in its Intelligence Report released Wednesday.

“2016 was an unprecedented year for hate,” Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the center, said in a statement. “The country saw a resurgence of white nationalism that imperils the racial progress we’ve made, along with the rise of a president whose policies reflect the values of white nationalists.” Such groups had increased nearly 14 percent the year before to 892 from 784 in 2014.

The SPLC defines hate groups as those that malign entire groups of people based on immutable characteristics such as race or ethnicity.

The rise in anti-Muslim hate groups echoes the most recent FBI statistics. Hate crimes against Muslims surged 67 percent in 2015, the more recent year for which statistics are available, the SPLC noted.

The most dramatic growth in the number of hate groups was the near-tripling of anti-Muslim hate groups: from 34 in 2015 to 101 last year pic.twitter.com/4NKwfbHW3h — SPLC (@splcenter) February 15, 2017

The SPLC also said that “several new and energetic groups appeared last year that were almost entirely focused on Trump and seemed to live off his candidacy.”

The center’s findings came just days after anti-Muslim posters were discovered at a mosque in Bossier City, Louisiana, and on the campuses of the University of Texas and Rutgers University in New Jersey.

The SPLC report said the Trump presidency has coincided with a spike in anti-Muslim activity.

In the first 10 days after his election, the SPLC said, it documented 867 bias-related incidents, including more than 300 that targeted immigrants or Muslims.

But the overall growth in hate groups was not limited to anti-Muslim organizations.

The number of black separatist groups also grew, to 193 last year from 180 in 2015, as did neo-Confederate groups, to 43 from 35, according to the SPLC.

Moving in the other direction, however, the number of ""Patriot,"" or anti-government groups, declined 37.5 percent to 623 last year from 998 in 2015, the center said.

""The groups had skyrocketed from a low of 149 in 2008 to a high of 1,360 in 2012, in large part as a reaction to the November 2008 election of Barack Obama,"" the report noted.

Similarly, the number of Ku Klux Klan groups fell to 130 from 190 the year before, after having more than doubled from 72 in 2014.

The center says it uses hate group publications and websites, citizen and law enforcement reports, field sources and news reports to compile its report.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/dylann-roofs-lawyers-death-penalty-tossed/story?id=45417758,"Lawyers for Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof have filed a motion for a new trial and are looking to throw out the death penalty sentences in the case.

The motion, filed in South Carolina federal court, questions whether Roof's attack was plotted and carried out wholly within the state, and therefore not a federal case, as well as whether the hate crimes he was convicted of were punishable by death.

""A finding in his favor on this motion would resolve the case, since he would not challenge further the resulting sentences of life in prison without the possibility of release,"" the lawyers wrote.

Roof was sentenced to death last month after he was convicted of hate crimes in federal court. He killed nine black churchgoers during a bible style at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in June 2015.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/feds-rule-fire-destroyed-texas-mosque-arson-30k/story?id=45356736,"Authorities have determined a fire that destroyed a Texas mosque was intentional but stopped short of calling it a bias crime, an official for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said today.

On Jan. 28, the Victoria Police Department responded to a fire at the mosque just after 2 a.m. when a store clerk at a nearby convenience store noticed heavy smoke coming from the building, according to O.C. Garza, communications director for the city of Victoria.

The fire fully engulfed the building and caused an estimated $500,000 in damages, according to the Houston Field Division of the ATF.

It took firefighters about four hours to extinguish the blaze, which gutted the building and left only the outside facade of the mosque intact.

Although the fire was determined to be intentionally set, the evidence at this time ""does not indicate the fire was a biased crime,"" the ATF said.

“Houses of worship are a sacred place in this country, and ATF is committed to devoting the necessary resources to solving this crime,” said Fred Milanowski, the special agent in charge of the ATF Houston Field Division.

“We are working closely with our local law enforcement and emergency service partners on this investigation and ask that anyone with information about this incident please report it.”

The ATF, along with the Victoria Islamic Center Mosque and Crime Stoppers, has offered a $30,000 reward for information leading to an arrest of the persons responsible, the ATF announced Wednesday.

Ibrahim Hooper, the National Communications Director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said CAIR is “obviously concerned” that the fire was determined to be intentionally set, because arson “can be an indicator of a bias motive.”

Hooper said that it may be easier to determine a motive once a perpetrator is apprehended.

The number of mosques targeted around the country increased to ""unprecedented levels” since the presidential election in November, Hooper said, adding that CAIR plans to release a report in the near future that shows that 2016 may have been “the worst year ever in terms of the number of hate incidents targeting American mosques.”

The mosque did not have insurance, the president of the Islamic center, Shahid Hashmi, told ABC News days after the fire. A GoFundMe account set up for the rebuilding of the mosque had surpassed $1 million as of Wednesday.

The Islamic Center of Victoria hosted study groups for people with different religions so they would better understand Islam, a 23-year member of the mosque, Omar Rachid, told ABC News. Non-members would stop by the mosque to share a meal during Ramadan, and the mosque would also host a potluck dinner for Muslims and non-Muslims alike every Friday evening.

The congregation plans to rebuild the mosque at its current site, Hashmi said. The members will congregate in a mobile home next to the site in the meantime.

Mr. President I'd like to ask for unanimous consent that the privileges of the four be granted to the foam member of my staff. Aaron Robinson. Without objection. I'm grateful for that I know the night is he's going on. It's on to a moment too it can express my appreciation to all the staff members when Sanders. Remain on the fourth year a lot of folks who work here. From the gentleman here typing very quickly. All the way to a lot of folks working as one express my gratitude for the long night to use of the pages it is their second week. Here and they suddenly are being forced to grapple with not just school. But the long nights of the United States senate not relieve you respect them and grateful for. Bear how Traci endurance tonight as well. I rise today as many my colleagues half. To speak to the nomination of Betsy do boss to speak specifically opposition. To her nomination to serve as secretary of education. I've listened to as much my colleagues words is all right it's like Coke can and I've. Want to say that particularly those on the senate health education labor and pension committees. They have all and will and continue to expand upon many of the concern owning elements. All of this is the boss's record. Concerns that I share. About her lack of support for critical accountability measures for lack of familiarity. With many of the basic financial aid policies and programs of short so essential. Four people have access to higher education. Our inability to say the guns. Should not be in schools. And her seeming lack of understanding. Of many the fundamental yet critical education policy perspectives that I think are necessary for a job of this magnitude I know there's been much said. And they'll be many more issues brought out of concern to many of the Democrats but that spoke tonight. But tonight I'd like to focus on an area that's very personal to me and also very personal to millions and millions of Americans. It is essential to this roll but one that may not be. Immediately understood when you talk about. A secretary for education but it is absolutely. Critical. To that department. In fact I think it is one of the more critical roles of that apartment when it comes to fulfilling. The ideals of war nation. Within the Department of Education. Is that office the war civil rights. And that office he's profoundly important. But it's one that many people don't have a full understanding. What I'd like to do right now is highlight for areas in which the office for civil rights functions. As in and also talked to as they relate to my concerns. About and my opposition to. Back to the boss to serve as secretary of education. First I'd like to talk about what's at stake. For children. With disabilities. And their families and their parents. About thirteen to 14%. A form Americans weeks children about six point five million kids. And young adults and America. Or students with a disability. Here in the United States I am so proud. That we had he deep belief. And in fact or loss. Passed. By people both houses. Couple parts. Dictate that all children. Be treated. With dignity and respect and that they won't get the educational opportunities that all children deserve. Deep. Or laws reflect that but the spirit of America. Is to see that in this nation all our children. Have unique gifts all were children have beauty. And we as a nation collectively believe that the people deserve extra long halfway. To the fundamental American ideals they deserve pathways to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It when we say justice for all. We really do mean all shall. But unfortunately. As the work of the department of education's office for civil rights demonstrates. The federal government is often at odds with some school districts. Who do not properly enforce protections. Granted to students with disabilities. Under the federal law. Again I ask why apple house has passed by both parties. With in our country. Thousands of parents. Do not believe their children are receiving. Justice in their local school children's since school systems fortune their children with disabilities. And they reach out. To the federal government. For help. For relief. For that justice. Take the example once thought the case of a nine year old child in California. Whose name I'm withholding in his withheld for privacy. This child and let's call her Jane is a student like so many others. As a sane dreams and aspirations has holes. Has promise. Has untapped unlimited potential. At the age of nine. This child. Jane had been physically restrained. In her school more than 92 times. During the eleven month period. During an eleven month period by her school. Because of her disability. And as a part of that true straight she'd been held face down four total of 2200. Minutes. Now the office of civil rights at the federal level the federal government. It took them to investigate this case. And they found that the district was in violation. All of the federal law and required the school district to stop using. These kind of restraints on students and actually take the time energy and that's the resource is in training the staff. On alternative intervention methods. It's that recognize the dignity of that trial. And show that we have the potential power to elevate that child not to so savagely restraint. This was not only unconscionable treatment that the federal government intervened in but clearly. It was illegal with in the federal bonds a federal law. This is not the way that anyone here. Anyone in this body with the trial with a disability. Any of us would want our children to be treated. If I had to talk. I know it's not the way that I would want them treated but frankly. When it comes to the children of America there are children. Whether Republican or Democrat we know it all our children. Arcades. American children all children frankly to store. Better in this kind of physical abuse. It's do you kind of reasons that are I believe. We need to have an aggressive office for civil rights. Because the story of Jane about nine year old is not an anomaly. It's not something that is rare. Unfortunately. As we're seeing there are many violations that go on a federal law when it comes toward children with disabilities here's tremendous evidence. That this kind of abuse still goes on in our country and there needs to be an ultimate authority that can investigate. This abuse and if necessary hold those people accountable who all are the abusers. Add the additional step if the office for civil rights does. Is give advice and it gave instructions. What how to make shore the abuse does not happen in the future. We need our office for civil rights to work with school districts to establish those policies and procedures. To prevent that abuse. Would miss the boss during her testimony. Was given the opportunity to speak to the millions of parents. Who have real legitimate concerns about their children with disabilities and the treatment babies even schools she was given the opportunity. To speak to the vital role. But the federal government in protecting our children and affirming. Goals rights. Buckle roll up your office for this for civil rights. Instead of talking are taking that opportunity. Instead of seizing the moment to talk about what she would be doing to leave he. She actually denied a role for the federal government. When asked about protecting students with disabilities she simply said it should be left ought to the states. While tell you right now for the hat nine year old child physically restrained more than 92 times held face down for hours. The federal government clearly had an important role to play for bat mom for that family for that child. It making short this kind of atrocity. Doesn't happen. And won't happen for more children. Secondly I'd like to talk about what's at stake for the office of civil rights as it results to children poor different. Whether that be the color of their skin. Was that they ware has dropped to school as an expression of their faith. War if there are minority organic aisle with a disability. I spoke you can. For example much as a senator about the school to prison pipeline and often how certain categories of children. Experience different types of discipline for the same act in school just because of how the law. School disciplinary policies we know play a big role in a child's success. And those disciplinary policies or clearly treating different children different ways. There will be different outcomes for those categories of kids. We know older children who have out of school suspensions. Often graduated significantly lower rates have significantly higher run ins with the law. I am one that the leafs that we cannot allow. Discrimination happened in that manner in our school. This is the facts this is the data it take for example. Black students part three point eight times more likely than their white peers. To receive one or more out of school suspensions while students. With disabilities actually work twice as likely than those with out to receive one or more out of school suspensions. And giving the specific case. Of two net power. Who wrote about her son who was black his name is Joseph. He was suspended five times and wanting fourteen. He was three years old. She said. One after another white mothers. Confessed the trouble their children had gotten into some of the behavior with similar to JJ's her songs sum was much worse. Most startling to me to her with it none of their children had been suspended she continues right. After this party. We're she heard this from other white parents. I read a study reflecting. Everything that I was living. Black children represented 18% of preschool enrollment. But make up 48%. Of preschool children receiving more than one out of school suspension. According to a study released. By the federal department of education's office for civil rights in March she writes. One of the critical things. About the office for civil rights is that they had did pro. Actively collecting data about differences in treatment in our schools. Now there are many people. Who actively asserts. That the role of the office for civil rights has grown too large. That they are pulled. Hang around in local matters. Too much. It even collecting such data. As was relied on by this mother. Is an intrusion. Into states' rights. I believe when it comes to civil rights when it comes to religious freedom. And the treatment of our children I do not believe that the office of civil rights has grown to look arch. I believe that they are offering. Critical transparency. Into the workings of our schools. That is collecting that they are collecting data that parents and policy makers. And civil rights groups can use to see. Who is being left behind. Who might be facing discrimination. Who is not receiving justice. What do we have to be afraid of even one just the collection of data. To allow us themselves to have that transparency. To create an environment of accountability. I worried that it this is not a priority for the next secretary of education. Did closing the achievement gap. Shutting down the school to prison pipeline. And empowering all children to have equal opportunities to learn will be undermined. These are real problems in our country. And they aren't just got a goal away. And the federal government especially when they insist upon data transparency. Isn't active partner in helping us to receive the justice that we. Deserve and eat and pledge allegiance to as a country. Aren't holt during the hearings of mr. boss off. I hear more that that even me. If I had the opportunity. To talk to my nominee myself I would have asked for more information around these issues. I didn't have that opportunity. And in the very rushed hearings. The issue. Wasn't race. Aren't believed though that based on the testimony that was given. But the nominee may not see this as it vital function of the office of civil right for civil rights. And in fact may shrink that office and the ongoing proactive investigations. That we see right now into such matters. And we know that the school to prison pipeline particularly for young people color is just real it's actually. Pervasive. But during this is the boss is confirmation hearing when asked about the office of civil rights with in the Department of Education. That is responsible for were written rectifying. Such unjust situations. She refused to comment she refused. Pop. She refused to commit herself people. To directing the office of civil rights to invest the. I don't understand what is it difficult thing to even could Mitt. The department to continuing such investigations. But that commitment was to not. What a next talk about. The serious problem we have in America with sexual assault and sexual violence. In schools and on college campuses. One in five women. And one at sixteen men or sexually assaulted in their college years. Book only 1%. Of assailants on college campuses or arrested charged or convicted. We still know that too many people in college campuses. Who've been sexually assaulting. Or survivors. Or routinely denied justice. And forced to even live or even go to class with their attackers. The office for civil rights. Has. Rolls to this challenge in this crisis. They've opened. Investigations in over 200 schools in America. There is. A crisis of campus sexual assault in America. And now. The office of civil rights expanding their work. He stepped up to that challenge. In addition to that. Big issue guidance to all college campus is on preventing and combating sexual assault. This a boss again during. Her testimony. Many of us were hoping that this is an issue she would rise occasion that she would speak to this issue. She was given the chance. Given a chance Constance to speak to the issue but to talk to the federal role in meeting this crisis to acknowledge that this. This issue our nation must grapple whip. And must end. But she did not speak to the concerns of parents. She did not speak to the concerns of survivors. Should not speak to America. About the urgent need for all of loss. To be engaged with dealing. With the crisis. For which there has been silent on to law. More than this she did not speak to the role of the office for civil rights. To be expanding role if he'd been taking to the expanding investigations. In college campuses all across the country giving no confidence. To me or others. That this will be a role that will continue. In fact a role that I believe should be expanded. And again even when she was specifically ask about what holding guidance. With in the Department of Education. On combating and preventing sexual assault not asked to commit. On the investigation not asked to commit to expanding. The efforts but just. Asked about upholding the guidance. With if the Department of Education while combating and preventing sexual assault. She refused to commit to maintaining. That guidance. Let's speak. To another area. Before I do I do believe this idea of transparency. The my previous college talked about what it comes to donations. Because some of the donations that have people of received charity. From. Mr. boss. Have a history of fighting against. Efforts. Come to combat sexual salt. And works some of these organizations work to make it more typical for sexual assault victims to seek justice. And that brings me to an area. In which I had a deep level of concern. That I hoped they met. Mr. boss would take the opportunity to set the record straight because much had been written before even the hearings. This involves an. An area where there is it clear crisis in our country. Is a crisis involving the safety in the security. All four lesbian gay bisexual and transgender youth in America. Lesbian gay bisexual transgender youth faced a stunning level. Of prejudice and discrimination. Inside and outside of schools starting at a very young. We know that LG BT youth or two times more likely. In their heterosexual peers to be physically. Physically assaulted in schools. LT BT youth or four times more likely. To attempt suicide. According to youth risk behavior survey 34%. Up LGV lesbian gay bisexual students were bullied on school property more than a third office of LG BT students. Were bullied all on school property. 13% of lesbian gay and bisexual students did not go to school. Because of concerns. They wore their seat. We know hole in America. That this kind of harassment has no place in our classrooms no place in our schools it has no place. Anywhere in our country. Putting his all too common. In all too often unaddressed. I'd like to talk about apparent. Her name is Wendy Walsh. The harassment against. Wendy's song set. Begin for him in the fourth great. When his classmate suspected he was dead. And by the time he reached the seventh grade. The world bully the verbal. And physical abuse in person and one line was so bad. Did he was afraid to walk home from school. Child lived in terror. Just going to class. Afterward one that bullying incident in a local park. His mom says that thirteen year old. Seth came home from school. She talked to a he asked the boy overlook pen from his mom. That conversation. Will be the last time she would see her son alive. The next time. Wendy saw her son sat. He had hanged himself. One a tree in their backyard. After Seth death. Wendy. Experiencing. A level of grief. In agony I cannot match. She decided to file a complaint. With the department of education's. Office for civil rights. When the office for civil rights came in and investigated. They found except school district. Was in violation of several. Federal laws. If they fail to intervene. And stop. The bullying. And harassment. And the tormenting that this child into work from the pressures of beaches. Until their death. If their actions. Could have potentially prevented. The death of one of all our children. For American chalk. Child of beauty. And of war and of dignity. And protection. Wendy went to the federal government. To the office of civil rights. And they took. Her concerns. Seriously. And they aggressively. Investigate. Because of their investigation because of Wendy's courage in her time. Of grief. The school district. In violation of federal walls. Was required to take steps. Though not bear to prevent. Her child's death. There were required to take steps. To prevent the kind of cool grass men and tormenting and bullying from half. Happening to other students. Shall work any of that is of Solis to a mother. Who lost their child. Notch or two G for comfort. But I am hopeful. It with an active office of civil rights. At the federal Department of Education. At a time. Where more than ten. Percent. Over lesbian gay and bisexual youth are missing school because of that kind of feel. When a third are reporting. Bullying and harassment in person or on line. It at this level. Of unconscionable treatment for any child. There is a role he wore the federal government. To protect. Our children. All I believe if we take these matters seriously. That we could. Could ensure warned that this kind of bullying and harassment called to a in America it's acceptable in a country this great. There are more laws. Against this and there are folks that have an obligation for enforcing Dole's loss that's the office of civil rights. Believe things will get better but they won't get better. Automatically. Because we hope for them because we pray for it. Get better. We are country that loves our children and love is not a being Burke it demands action. And we see time and time again. The children aren't seen the kind of action where they are and thank god right now there's a place where parents couldn't go. They can appeal to the federal government. The Department of Education office bowl right have to be led by someone who takes this seriously who see. The call for justice of lesbian gay bisexual transgendered youth at back. Defuse the crisis. But fears the problem. It was widely reported. We listened to bosses nominees was made widely reported. Get her family had given support significant support. That she hurts all significant support to discriminatory. Extremist dangerous and hateful groups. It promotes. Idea who is bit saying a child. With today. It is somehow less. The child that is not X. Groups that. Supported things like conversion therapy something that has been result. The only condemn. Dangerous ideas that are hurtful to children. With all of that with all the articles been written. This was achieve its war this is the boss to sit. Before the American public. Knowing that these concerns are out there and it's understandable. Even if she doesn't hold them it's understandable. That this was a moment for her to leap appears. Up a thousand and thousands of children were being is the lead in hurt by bullies. The people there being. Fifa defaulting on their did he children war have suicide rates are unquestionably high parents were mourning their kids. With all that swirled the hearings warmer she have to set the record straight. Think I will uphold the value and the dignity of those children but more than that I recognized as a crisis in our Cotchery. And that I will work with the office of civil rights to do something to address. This evil in or contrary. I have sold many kids. Being hurt and harm. This was virtually that's. To go beyond just denying that she believed in conversion therapy to call beyond. Just words in asserting. That she values equality this was her chance it should have been understood. Dip because of the rocker. And the charitable donations. That there was a degree of suspicion. There was understandable degree of legitimate thing you're. That she would not continue the Regis work of the office of civil rights in combating discrimination. And harassment. And physical abuse of children. Across our country she had the opportunity. Keep the fears and concerns. There have been expressed. I would've hoped the she would have spoken directly to the work of the office of civil rights. To protect lesbian gay bisexual and transgender teens. Wharf actually experiencing. Some of the highest levels of hate crimes and violence and bullying of any children in America. As she would meet some affirmation. That she would be a champion for the year quality for their dignity. And the office of civil rights would continue its viewed work. But she did. I hope that she would stand up and say we have. Violence or college campuses. It right now silence is a look going. In Phineas. Realities to exist and. We have a problem with reporting rates we have a problem with those reports being made in not taking seriously. She could use that as an opportunity to speak against what's happening to an unconscionable level. Of young women on college campus is something we would want to happen to not barred to all owners. To make a pledge that the office of civil rights were not just continue campus advisories. But that would fight to hold both college campuses accountable. But she did. For students and families across the country. If an obvious celebrated part we may not all no one America but the office the Department of Education. Many people don't even know they have an office for civil heights. Put force hole. Many. Families. With children on college camp purses and preschools. Grade schools in high schools.

He is the far-right provocateur, whose scheduled appearance sparked proflts on the uc Berkeley campus. Milo yiannopoulos has called feminism a cancer and routinely mocks liberals for being ugly and was banned from Twitter. Who is he and why does she provoke such strong reactions? Reporter: The university of California Berkeley, erupting in flames last night. Shut it down! Reporter: Campus officials say it started out over a peaceful protest, over a thousand turning out because this man was scheduled to speak on campus. Black lives matter is nothing more than the last socially acceptable hate group. Muslims rape everyone. I'm grateful for everyone for coming, but quite honestly, Your feelings. Reporter: He's one of the most famous or infamous self-proclaimed trolls on the internet. He's an editor at Breitbart, the conservative news website. I don't say anything I don't believe. But I do say things in a way that is going to elicit a response from people. Reporter: ABC's Terry Moran interviewed him in London last fall. I'm so bored of this uptight -- no. America needs more hatred. Reporter: The Berkeley event was supposed to be the last stop on his college tour. We will not tolerate racism or sexism, or hate crimes and violence. He's a fascist and Berkeley did not welcome him. Reporter: But it was canceled after more than a hundred people with black masks, armed with fire crackers and baseball bats, showed up, seizing an opportunity to turn the otherwise peaceful protest violent. I knowledthink we have a right to say we don't want him here. Reporter: The stand-off intensifying. At least six people were injured, including this trump supporter, who was pepper-sprayed. Kiara says, as a gay conservative herself, she was there to hear milo. She expected protesters but nothing like this. They hit all my friends with flag poles, I had to jump over a fence. I was there to voice my opinion about free speech and watch a controversial view. I think this is like an historic moment. I feel like I'm embodying Berkeley style more than anyone else there. Reporter: Milo later taking to Facebook to respond. They're so threatened by the idea that a conservative speaker might take some people with him, they just have to shut it down at all costs. Reporter: The president now threatening to cut funding if uc Berkeley doesn't allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people. No federal funds? However, experts say there's no federal law that allows the U.S. Government to deny funding because it prohibited someone from speaking on campus. Uc Berkeley said police evacuated milo from campus for his own safety, bringing the event to an end. Adding that while they have made clear, our belief that the provocations of Mr. Yiannopoulos were in marked opposition to the basic values of the university, we respected his right to come to campus and speak. But tonight, milo continues to fan the flames on Fox News. Berkeley gets $370 million a year. It's one of the biggest research universities, one of the highest ranked universities. But it's turning out graduates who don't do much. Only 47% of their graduates go on to full time employment when they leave. That money could be repurposed if Berkeley refuses to honor its first amendment commitments. I don't think any serious person denies American academia is dominated by left-wing points of view. He's allowed to be as hateful, racist, misogynistic as he is. But good people also have their free speech to say that's not acceptable. Reporter: The protests at Berkeley just the latest flosh point in an increasingly divided country. People have been prompted to exercise their free speech rights, galvanized around issues like women's rights, environmental concerns, and immigration. And then you have opportunists like milo who are gleaming off, poaching off this divisiveness. Reporter: For milo, there seems to be no limits, no holds barred for the dropout from Cambridge university, a sometime poet, tech journalist, Donald Trump supporter, gay catholic, and entrepreneur. I don't entirely believe in lesbians. Reporter: Milo said no one should be upset by his jabs. If I'm mean, it's normally because they're deserve it. America's had enough of niceness. If my rudeness provokes conversation, and 20% of people stop talking about what I was actually saying, I will consider my career to have been a terrific success. Reporter: Milo helping to legitimize a movement of negativity growing on the internet. One of his hot topics is the female physique. You're going to go after somebody's body to denigrate their ideas? Absolutely. What grade are you? Seriously? That's revolting. No, it's not. What's revolting is the body positivity movement. What's revolting is this idea now that you can tell women that they'll be healthy at any size. It tells women you can be fat and unattractive and you'll be happy anyway. That's a lie. Reporter: Another target, the mainstream media. It's no surprise I get a lot of bad press, because my stated enemy is the press. I'm dedicated to the destruction of political correctness, and that's the language the media speaks. Reporter: Milo is not the only Breitbart person making headlines. There's also Steve Bannon. Suddenly Breitbart, which used to be on the outside, throwing stones in, is on the inside throwing stones out. Reporter: Bannon, now trump's senior adviser in the oval office, is generating his own share of controversy. He's the person that is urging president trump to continue his combative and aggressive tone. Go to war with the news media. Bannon has a seat at the table in just about all the critical places. He's been elevated in the national security council. He's been put in charge of task forces. He's been creating his own lines of communication. Reporter: House minority leader Nancy Pelosi today saying she believes America is less safe with Bannon having trump's ear. This is a stunning thing. That a white supremacist Bannon would have a permanent seat dismissing the chairman of national intelligence as permanent members. Reporter: Bannon does not identify as a white supremacist, but has referred to himself as an economic nationalist. We're concerned with some of the initial executive orders and statements we've seen from the white house. We've been public about our concern about the treatment of refugees, the Muslim ban, the religious test. A lot of people are very uncomfortable with the tenor of the public discussion. Reporter: The tenor that reached a pitch last night at uc Berkeley, has quieted today. A few reminders of what happened, still visible. But for now, this divided country showing fewer signs of uniting. For ""Nightline,"" I'm kayna Whitworth in Berkeley, California.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/ohio-community-rallies-mom-allegedly-targeted-anti-muslim/story?id=45142063,"An Ohio community came together on Sunday to rally for a woman who was allegedly the target of anti-Muslim fliers posted around her neighborhood.

Over 300 people from all across the state of Ohio rallied in front of Mason Community Center in solidarity with Rawd Saleh, 41, Saleh said. The rally was in reaction to fliers allegedly posted around Saleh’s neighborhood with her address illustrated on a map and a picture of her titled “neighborhood terrorist warning.”

""As Americans, if we see suspicious activity, we should tell the authorities,"" Saleh told ABC News. ""I don’t see any other suspicion that this person could’ve had other than I wear hijab.""

WCPO

Saleh said she has lived in Ohio for 35 years and in Mason for a year. When the mother of three returned home last week after a weekend out of town, her neighbors notified her immediately about the alleged flier labeling her as a terrorist and said that they had contacted the police, she said.

Saleh said that she was assured by her neighbors that they did not feel threatened by her and supported her living in the community.

Plans for the rally came about when Saleh was contacted by Sarah Martin, a nurse who said she received a flier in her mailbox, and Martin's friend Cyndi Ritter, a licensed therapist.

The three met over coffee for the first time Friday discussing how to respond to the alleged fliers in Mason and ultimately decided to organize a rally at the Mason Community Center two days later, inviting their friends on Facebook.

WCPO

Ritter, 31, told ABC News that she felt empowered after attending the Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21, adding that the march encouraged her to “[not] go back to your communities and just stay silent.”

“I think that when a hate crime like this happens that you need to have a swift reaction,” Ritter said, highlighting that this is only the third rally or demonstration she has been involved in, “which is why we had the rally two days after we planned it.”

As a woman born in Jerusalem to a Palestinian father and Turkish mother, Saleh said that she was shocked by the incident because Mason is such a diverse neighborhood.

Mason police are still investigating to determine who allegedly made and distributed the fliers.",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/US/charleston-victims-mother-tells-dylann-roof-forgive/story?id=44704096,"Felicia Sanders, the mother of one of the nine victims killed by Dylann Roof in a Charleston church, told Roof this morning at an emotional sentencing hearing, ""I forgive you.""

""That's the easiest thing I had to do. But you don't want to help somebody who don't want to help themselves,"" she told her son's killer, according to ABC affiliate WCIV. ""May God have mercy on your soul.""

Sanders survived Roof's shooting rampage on June 17, 2015, that killed nine black parishioners who had gathered at the Charleston, South Carolina, church for Bible study. She was there when her son, Tywanza Sanders, was shot to death.

A jury on Tuesday afternoon sentenced Roof to death. His formal sentencing was held today, during which Felicia Sanders and other family and friends of the victims addressed Roof directly in court. Roof did not look at them as they spoke. After the statements from family and friends, Roof declined to speak. Roof was then formally sentenced to death.

Robert Maniscalco

""You took my love away from me. And since June 17 I've gotten to know you,"" Felicia Sanders said to Roof at his sentencing hearing, according to WCIV. ""I know you because you are in my head all day.""

""I can't hear balloons pop. I can't see the fireworks,"" she continued. She explained that she can't shut her eyes to pray because she needs to keep them open to see those around her.

Tywanza Sanders' father, Tyrone Sanders, said to Roof, ""I need you to look at me.""

""You look at each individual in this room. Each and every one of us are a little different, but we are still human,"" he said, according to WCIV. ""Why you want to single out black people in a church I don't know. But whoever your creator is needs to come be with you.""

Grace Beahm/The Post And Courier via AP Photo

According to WCIV, Tywanza Sanders' sister, Shirrene Goss, told Roof, ""One day it's going to come to you and you're going to realize you did not have to do this. And it's going to bring you to your knees. And you're going to have to ask -- no -- you're going to have to beg, for forgiveness.""

""My brother didn't deserve what he got,"" she said. ""None of the victims did. But you deserve every bit of the sentence you received.""

Roof, 22, was sentenced to death by the jury after three hours of deliberations on Tuesday. Roof was convicted of hate crimes resulting in death, among other charges, in his federal death penalty case. This is the first time a death penalty verdict was rendered in a federal hate crimes case, the Justice Department said.

Before the jury began deliberating, Roof told the jury Tuesday in a closing statement, ""I still feel like I had to do it.""

Bethane Middleton-Brown, sister of the slain Rev. Depayne Middleton-Doctor, said to Roof today, according to WCIV, ""I wanted to hate you, but my faith tells me no. I wanted to remain angry and bitter, but my view of life won't let me.""

""You took someone precious from me, but my faith tells me she was a borrowed angel God called home,"" she said, according to WCIV. To Roof, she said, ""You can't look at me, but when you're alone you will hear my voice and see my face.""

Stephen B. Morton/AP Photo

Middleton-Doctor's daughter, Gracyn, called Roof ""Satan.""

""You will rot in hell where you belong,"" she said, as Roof sat motionless, according to WCIV. ""I hope your guilt eats you alive. While you're pleading for life and begging for your life, I hope God forgives you, the one sin I'm not sure even he can forgive. ... This spawn of Satan will not steal our joy.""

Middleton-Doctor's niece addressed Roof as ""the devil sitting here today.""

""How dare you sit here every day looking dumb-faced, acting like you did nothing wrong, and had the nerve to insinuate you were misled. How dare you even smile or smirk. ... I've wanted to wipe that smile off your face myself,"" she said, according to WCIV. ""You are the biggest coward I have ever seen in my life because you can't be a man and look at us. ... It really shows the kind person you are, excuse me, the kind of animal you are. I have many choice words I would love to say to you, but God is working on me so I will not.""

She said Roof's mission ""failed"" because the tragedy brought people closer together.

Rose Simmons, daughter of the slain Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., told Roof, ""I loved my father. I was just like him. And I'm going to miss him and I will miss getting to know him all over again in my adult life. But I don't grieve so much for my father because I know he and his eight precious eternal comrades, they are at this very moment experiencing the greatest peace, and that's a peace not found here on this earth.""

She said she's not surprised Roof hasn't shown accountability, sorrow or remorse. ""I know at this time it's not there.""

Rev. Simmons' son, Dan Simmons Jr., said to Roof, ""I forgive you.""

""I know that you don't understand that, but God requires me to forgive you. I forgive you. He also requires me to plead and pray for you, and I do that,"" Simmons Jr. said, according to WCIV. ""Understand that as you have been judged, know that you have an opportunity to ask for forgiveness. Know that you can change your life. Stay focused. I guarantee if you choose to serve him you will have a better life.""

Rev. Sharon Risher, daughter of slain churchgoer Ethel Lance, said she's against Roof's death sentence. ""I still don't want you to die,"" Risher said, adding she wants him to sit in a jail cell.

Risher told Roof, WCIV reported, ""You have opened doors, and given me a platform. ... Hopefully you will get to read the newspapers because you will get to see me crusading for each of those nine people. ... May God have mercy on you.""

Lance's son, Gary Washington, spoke today through sign language interpreters. He recounted the tragic moment he was told his mother was dead, and he said that since the shooting, he's been left with no one to take care of him the way his mother could, WCIV reported. Washington said to Roof, ""I know you'll be burning in hell.""

Gail Jackson, niece of slain churchgoer Susie Jackson, said to Roof that to see him sit in court every day and never apologize hurts her.

She said she hopes his soul burns in hell. She added she hopes God has mercy on Roof's mother's soul.

Melvin Graham, brother of slain churchgoer Cynthia Hurd, said to Roof, the hate ""you possess is beyond human comprehension.""

Graham said Roof wanted to start a race war, but instead started a love war; Graham said how Hurd was honored with a library, scholarships, a fellowship and more.

""When my sister was executed, it tore me apart,"" Graham said. He said he and his sister used to go on walks, so after her funeral, he carried her the last steps of the way at the cemetery.

Jennifer Pinckney, whose husband, South Carolina State Sen. Clementa Pinckney, was killed in the shooting, told WCIV today that she's glad that the process is over.

She had testified during the trial, saying her husband was a loving, devoted and involved father to their two young daughters, ages 12 and 7. She and her younger daughter were in an office at the church on the night of the shooting. They hid under a desk as gunshots rang out and put their hands over each other's mouth.

Today Jennifer Pinckney said her daughters ""miss daddy.""

""He was our rock,"" she said, adding, ""my girls have been strong. I've been very proud of them.""

Blondelle Gadsden, sister of slain churchgoer Myra Thompson, said she still wonders how a 21-year-old could carry out this attack, according to WCIV. Gadsden said she may not get those answers, but said she has gained a greater sense of God and an appreciation of her family -- especially her parents -– after the attack.

Brenda Hargrove, aunt of slain churchgoer Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, spoke of her niece's sweet spirit and their family's close bond. Hargrove said her church in New Jersey gave Coleman-Singleton a memorial service.

U.S. Attorney Beth Drake of the District of South Carolina said Tuesday, ""Motivated by racist hatred, Dylann Roof murdered and attempted to murder innocent African-American parishioners as they worshiped in the historic Mother Emanuel church.""

""But, contrary to Roof’s desire to sow the seeds of hate, his acts did not tear this community apart. Instead of agitating racial tensions as he had hoped, Roof’s deadly attack inside Mother Emanuel became an attack on all of us, and the community stood in solidarity. Now, following a trial, the jury has rendered a sentence that underscores the severity of his crimes,"" Drake said.

Roof's family said in a statement, ""We will always love Dylann. We will struggle as long as we live to understand why he committed this horrible attack, which caused so much pain to so many good people. We wish to express the grief we feel for the victims of his crimes, and our sympathy to the many families he has hurt. We continue to pray for the Emanuel AME families and the Charleston community.""

Roof's defense said in a statement that the ""sentencing decision means that this case will not be over for a very long time. We are sorry that, despite our best efforts, the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy.""

Roof also faces a state trial in which he may again face the death penalty.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jeff-sessions-dismisses-racism-claim-hints-trump-justice/story?id=44667596,"Jeff Sessions was on the offense today -- to a certain degree.

The Republican senator from Alabama, who is Donald Trump's pick to be the next U.S. attorney general, vehemently disputed ""amazing"" allegations that he harbors racial bias and claimed he understands the struggles of LGBT Americans.

But Sessions also told the Senate Judiciary Committee -- which is holding confirmation hearings this week to consider his nomination to lead the Justice Department -- that remained critical of the H-1B visa program and implied that religion could play an indirect role in whether an individual is accepted into the U.S.

Sessions on Race and Policing

Sessions walked into the Senate hearing room this morning to shouting from protesters dressed in Ku Klux Klan costumes and others holding signs saying, ""Stand against xenophobia"" and ""Love trumps hate.""

Sessions seemed unfazed, and many in the room cheered as the protesters were removed. His testimony was interrupted by other protesters several times today. At least two other people interrupted his opening remarks, one shouting, ""No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.""

Indirectly addressing those protesters, Sessions told the Senate Judiciary Committee, ""I abhor the Klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology.""

And in his statement to the committee this morning, Sessions touched upon the polarizing issue of policing minority communities. He defendied law enforcement officers who have been ""unfairly maligned"" in recent years, and he insisted he understands the struggle for justice by ""our African-American brothers and sisters.""

Still, hours into today's hearing, he faced tough questions over his record on civil rights and his plan for cooling tensions between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve.

Sessions, 70, has faced significant criticism from top Democrats and some civil rights groups over decades-old allegations that he made racist remarks when he was a U.S. attorney in Alabama. Today he dismissed the allegations as outright false or taken out of context.

""I hope my tenure in this body shows you that the caricature of me wasn't accurate,"" Sessions told senators. ""It wasn't accurate then, and it's not accurate now.""

The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said Sessions' 20 years in the Senate mean ""we know him well.""

""He is a man of honor and integrity, dedicated to the faithful and fair enforcement of the law, who knows well and deeply respects the Department of Justice and its role,"" Grassley said in his opening remarks, noting that as U.S. attorney in Alabama during the 1980s, Sessions ""oversaw the investigation of Klansman Francis Hays for the brutal abduction and murder of a black teenager, Michael Donald.""

During what may have been the most uncomfortable moments for Sessions during the first half of the day, Al Franken, D-Minn., pressed Sessions on whether he has ""misrepresented"" or ""inflated"" his role in prosecuting civil rights cases and standing up for minorities when U.S. attorney. In particular, Franken took aim at Sessions' claim that he ""personally handled"" several cases, suggesting the extent of his involvement in those cases may have been just signing charging documents.

Sessions fired back, saying he not only signed the documents but also ""provided assistance and guidance"" to attorneys working on the cases and ""attempted to be as effective as I could be in helping them be successful in these historic cases.""

He added that he ""had an open door policy with them and cooperated with them on these cases.""

Sessions Stakes Position on Same-Sex Marriage

Sessions said in his opening remarks, ""I understand the demands for justice and fairness made by the LGBT community.""

But the top Democrat on the committee, Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called Sessions' record ""extremely conservative"" and emphasized that the next attorney general must enforce the law ""equally for all Americans,"" not advocate for his own beliefs.

She noted that he has taken what she called ""deeply concerning"" stances, including support for keeping people out of the United States based on their religion, support for ""illegal"" waterboarding of terrorism suspects and opposition to LGBT rights legislation.

Other critics have also pointed to Sessions' dismay at the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry and his opposition to the Matthew Shepard Act, which expanded the definition of hate crimes to include attacks on people because of their sexual orientation, gender or disability.

Asked during today's hearing whether he believes the issue of same-sex marriage is settled —- now that the Supreme Court has ruled that gay and lesbian couples may marry nationwide —- Sessions said he will ""follow that decision."" He explained that he opposed the Matthew Shepard Act out of ""a concern that it appeared that these cases were being prosecuted effectively in state court"" but said that since it has become law and ""the Congress has spoken, you can be sure that I will enforce it.""

Where Sessions Stands on Clinton

During her opening remarks, Feinstein cited Trump's promise on the campaign trail that his attorney general would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton.

""That's not what an attorney general does,"" Feinstein said. ""The attorney general does not investigate or prosecute at the direction of the president.""

Sessions vowed today that as attorney general, he would recuse himself from any matters related to Clinton.

On the campaign trail, he spoke out against Clinton over her use of a private email server as secretary of state, which became the subject of an FBI criminal investigation.

Sessions noted that the presidential campaign was ""contentious"" and that he made several comments about Clinton's possible criminal culpability.

""I do believe that that could place my objectivity in question ... I think the proper thing would be to recuse myself,"" he told the other senators.

Pot Talk

With several states legalizing the use of recreational marijuana, such as Washington, Oregon, and California, it was a topic that was bound to come up. Sessions has been critical of states' efforts to legalize marijuana, but he's also a proponent of state's rights.

Asked whether he will have the Department of Justice investigate and prosecute medical marijuana users in states that have deemed it legal, Sessions said, ""Well, I won't commit to never enforce federal law ... But absolutely it's a problem of resources for the federal government.""

And Sessions added, ""One obvious concern is that Congress has made the possession of marijuana in every state an illegal act. If that is not desired any longer, Congress should pass a law to change it. It’s not the attorney general’s job to decide which laws to enforce. We should enforce the laws as effectively as we are able.""

On Trump's Dismissal of Voter Fraud Claims

Sen. Al Franken asked Sessions about what he called ""bogus claims of voter fraud"" by Trump, particularly a tweet saying he won the popular vote if the millions of people whom he believes allegedly voted illegally were deducted. Sessions said of that Tweet’s claim, ""I don't know what the president-elect meant or was thinking when he made that comment or what facts he may have had to justify his statement. I would just say that every election needs to be managed closely and we need to ensure that there is integrity in it. And I do believe we regularly have fraudulent activities occur during elections cycles.""

What About Waterboarding?

While Trump has spoken highly of the torture tactic, Sessions was less enthusiastic. He said that the current law passed by Congress, ""does appear to be clear” in prohibiting waterboarding. So, he said, ""I would enforce that law.""

Violent Crime 'Cannot Continue'

Much of Sessions' opening remarks today focused on the ""heroin epidemic"" across America and the jump in violent crime in certain U.S. cities, including a record-setting number of murders and shootings in Chicago last year.

""These trends cannot continue,"" he said. ""It is a fundamental civil right to be safe in your home and your community ... It will be my priority to confront these crises vigorously, effectively and immediately.""

Sessions vowed to support state and local law enforcement across the country, calling recent attacks on police in the line of duty ""a wake-up call"" and recognizing the officers killed in the line of duty in Florida Monday. The alleged murderer of one officer is still the target of an extensive manhunt.

""That is the kind of thing that too often happens,"" he said, adding that ""there is virtually no defense"" for assaulting a police officer and that recent criticism of law enforcement is making matters worse.

""In the last several years, law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the actions of a few bad actors and for allegations about police that were not true,"" he said. ""I do believe that we are failing to appreciate police officers who place their lives at risk ... We need to be sure that when we criticize law officers, it is narrowly focused on the right basis for criticism. And to smear whole departments places those officers at greater risk.""

'Caricature of Me in 1986 Was Not Correct'

Many Democrats have expressed concern over testimony during Sessions' confirmation hearing for a federal judgeship in 1986, when some accused Sessions of calling a white civil rights lawyer a ""disgrace to his race"" and dubbing some actions by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ""un-American.""

""After four days of hearings and extensive testimony, Sessions' nomination was rejected by a Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. He was too extreme for Republicans in 1986,"" Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wrote in The Boston Globe on Sunday. ""Now that he is nominated to be attorney general, we will see if the same person is still too extreme for Republicans.""

Leahy, until recently the top Democrat on the committee, said, ""Sessions has repeatedly stood in the way of efforts to promote and protect Americans' civil rights.""

But Sessions today said, ""This caricature of me in 1986 was not correct. I conducted myself honorably and properly at that time,"" and ""I did not harbor the animosities ... that I was accused of. I did not.""

Sessions later described how, growing up in the South, he saw discrimination firsthand and had ""no doubt"" that it hurt many other Southerners.

""I know that was wrong. I know we need to do better. We can never go back,"" he said.

""I deeply understand the history of civil rights and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters,"" he insisted.

He promised that politics will play no role in his Justice Department.

""The Office of the Attorney General of the United States is not a political position, and anyone who holds it must have total fidelity to the laws and the Constitution of the United States,"" Sessions said today.

Russian Hacking and More Trump-Related FBI Investigations

Asked today whether he believed the U.S. intelligence community's unanimous conclusion that the Russian government was behind a series of cyberattacks aimed at affecting the presidential election, Sessions said, ""I have no reason to doubt that, and have no reason to believe otherwise."" He said that he is ""sure"" the FBI's conclusions blaming Russia were ""honorably reached"" and that ""it is appropriate for a nation to retaliate against"" government-sponsored hacks.

But he said he knows only ""what the media says about"" the pre-election attacks, and he indicated he was holding off on a final opinion until he is briefed by the FBI.

Later in the hearing, Sheldon Whitehouse, R-R.I., asked Sessions whether he would allow the Justice Department and FBI to continue investigating Russian connections, even if those probes lead to the Trump campaign or Trump associates. Sessions said, ""If there are laws violated and can be prosecuted, you'll have to handle that in an appropriate way.""

But, he added, ""the problem may turn out to be"" that, like the huge hack of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management carried out on behalf of the Chinese government, such matters may be best handled at the political level.",abcnews.com,True

Melvin Graham, brother of victim Cynthia Hurd, said after Roof's sentence was read this afternoon, ""Today we had justice for my sister."" But he called Roof's sentence a ""very hollow victory because my sister's still gone.""

""I wish that this verdict could have brought her back,"" he added.

Graham said he supported the death penalty in this case, calling Roof's crimes ""executions."" He added that Roof took nine lives in a brutal fashion with no remorse.

""It's a hard thing to know that someone's going to lose their life,"" Graham said of Roof. ""But when you look at the totality of what happened, it's hard to say that this person deserves to live.""

Roof, 22, was sentenced to death this afternoon in a unanimous decision by the jury for killing nine black churchgoers during a Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015. This verdict comes at the end of the federal death penalty case in which he was convicted of hate crimes resulting in death, among other charges. This is the first time a death penalty verdict was rendered in a federal hate crimes case, the Justice Department said today.

Roof also faces a state trial in which he may again face the death penalty. The state trial was delayed indefinitely last week.

The jury began deliberating Roof's fate earlier today, after Roof told the jury in a closing statement, ""I still feel like I had to do it.""

Asked whether he has forgiven Roof, Graham replied, ""I'm a work in progress.""

""I think that in time that'll come,"" he said. ""I can't live in hate. But I think in time it'll come, the peace will come. But right now, no.”

Graham added that Roof's fate is ""in God's hands now.""

As Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson laid out the government's argument for the death penalty today, he called Roof's actions ""calculated."" ""He spent years acquiring this deep hatred, this deep hatred we would all like to believe could not exist in someone. But it does. You've seen it,"" Richardson said.

Sketch by Robert Maniscalco

In the government's closing argument today, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson laid out the government's argument for the death penalty.

He recounted to the jury how on the night of the June 17, 2015, shooting, the unsuspecting victims, who had gathered for a Bible study, welcomed Roof, a stranger, to join them. Roof then opened fire on them; the victims were vulnerable targets with their eyes closed in prayer, Richardson said, according to WCIV.

Richardson said that before the killings, Roof's racist hatred built up for years.

Roof scouted the Emanuel AME Church months before, calling and visiting, Richardson said. After buying the murder weapon with his birthday money, Roof bought enough magazines to have 88 rounds, which had racist symbolism, Richardson said: 88 is an abbreviation for the Nazi salute ""Heil Hitler,"" as ""h"" is the eighth letter in the alphabet.

Besides a website where he shared his message of ""hate,"" Richardson said, Roof mentally and physically prepared for the shooting; he took photos with his gun pointed at the camera and recorded video of his target practice.

""He chose to videotape himself doing it so he could see the very last images these victims would see,"" Richardson said, according to WCIV. ""He wanted to see what he would look like as he stood over them, executing them.""

""This is calculated. Misguided but thoughtful,"" Richardson said, according to WCIV. ""He spent years acquiring this deep hatred, this deep hatred we would all like to believe could not exist in someone. But it does. You've seen it.""

Richardson said that after Roof left the scene of the shooting, he ""fully understood the horrific nature"" of his crime. Roof fled on back roads to North Carolina, knowing police were looking for him, and he avoided using his debit card, knowing it could be tracked, Richardson said.

While Roof expressed sorrow to his parents and pity for himself, he didn't shed a tear for the people he killed, Richardson said. Roof showed multiple times that he didn't have remorse, according to Richardson, from his jailhouse manifesto with racist language to the shoes he wore in court during this trial that had racist symbols on them.

Roof was willing to plead guilty if the government would take the death penalty off the table, which Richardson said shows ""that he wants to spend his life in prison, listening to the radio, and writing more racist filth,"" WCIV reported.",abcnews.com,True

All day and analysis so go online abcnews.com and check that out to get yourself. Caught I do you bring someone down in Washington and I was also been keeping a close eye on this I was actually in the room this morning Hilary Shelton. Is the NAACP. Washington bureau director he joins us live now from Washington DCMR shells and thank you so much for being with us. Allison with so. Am I correct for you in the hearing room this morning -- keep keeping and I am I telling what you thought of how the day's gone so far. Who will yes indeed this amount afraid their from the introduction of mr. sessions to his opening remarks. And then into a number of the questions from his colleagues in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Go there were there was an and over packed room for instance and that would sell shows how. Much interest and concern there was the American people as we've looked at our next attorney general of the United States. There were demonstrators you may have seen for those who watched on television so reference and code pink. Where there actually raising concerns about mr. sessions and mr. trump is well. But it was a very very hopeful and and well attended here. So mr. Fossum why do you feel it necessary to be there in the room to represent the NAACP interest and what did you think of mr. sessions answer to the questions posed to him this morning. Well we're always very anxious and involving any decisions made there as important and rise to the level. Of the most important and powerful. Law enforcement person our country. Missiles certainly the attorney general's office extremely important along those lines. Would actually talk with members of the Judiciary Committee share with them are concerned sent letters of actually polls and mr. sessions confirmation. See we've known missed secession for quite some time. Going back to his years with the as the US attorney deputy US attorney first and US attorney. Then on from there to this position as the state attorney general for the state of Alabama. And certainly have watched very closely over the last twenty years of its worth in Washington DC and most specifically on this Judiciary Committee. There a number of concerns we have about he as a nominee and more importantly. He as the attorney general of the United States as it looked at not only his behavior. Prior to coming to Washington this US senate but also his voting record. On many of the extremely important issues that the attorney general is actually responsible for enforcing. So mr. Shelton count me out here of what continuing Lori some of those concerns for me specifically because your organization. We know. He has that been accused of calling an American in the past. He is also been accused of making racist statements in the past most of which he is denied. He's joked about the kkk. Which he said. With a joke at the time that he should not have made. Can you tell me a little bit about specifically what you are concerned about. As mr. sessions becoming the attorney general. Oh very good as you talk about the issues of the past of course as I think about his position as a US attorney Arctic US attorney first. And US attorney for the Department of Justice. For the southern district of Alabama. And in off from their serving as the state attorney general. There are a number of issues that are in the street that his temperament. Seems to be very concerned as we talk but issues of this interaction. With those who he would be responsible for protecting. Apple sauce be responsible point forcing. By talk about more recently I think that's probably what talent. If you look at his voting record what do you see as the NAACP utilizes is civil rights report card. Mr. sessions has voted less at are less than 10%. Out of a 100% on key civil rights issues important to the African American community and other communities in double ACP sellers. As an example it for those who are watching towards the the end of this as we move towards my discussion. You heard them talking about issues like the violence against women act. The N double ACP was very instrumental in supporting him passed in the files of Islam that understand the challenges of women happened aside. As a look at issues of violence and and domestic abuse rape and other concerns that if a women very specifically. For him to vote against such an important provision. That the NAACP actually worked to put in place as now escalated to a division. Of the Justice Department raises major concerns for us we don't believe that someone that is worked against a law like that should also be given the responsibility of forcing. That's a tough but issues like hate crimes mr. sessions voted against the hate crimes prevention act as well. African Americans are about 60%. Of the reported victims of hate crimes in the United States. We need a Justice Department and very important at the Helm of the Justice Department. An attorney general is also willing to recognize appreciate. And work to fully enforce those laws too to make sure that when these hate crimes happen. We have the fool coalition that made this made up. The federal government state and local governments to solve this very expensive crimes investigated by the way. And of course utilize the new technologies. Like DNA evidence they're also extremely important along those lines. As it is should look at issues that are crucial to our site having our voices heard are as we talk about the right to vote. We know that mr. sessions did vote for the last reauthorization of voting rights act and 92 nose and since mid 2006. But mr. sessions were behind the scenes to weaken the law all along the way as a matter of fact. He was actually planning on moving in the week an amendment to section five of the bullet right side was com referred to as the pre clearance section. But decided to let it go at the last minute. In essence as it thinking about the challenge that we have now. With Shelby vs holder by the decisions of that this struck. Part of the voting rights act makes it much more difficult to utilize my for impossible to utilize section five the pre clearance section. We know that mr. sessions attitude. And the worth the senate before it can has worked against these very very important laws that the Justice Department is responsible for enforcing. Ms. Shelton senator sessions has promised to be an attorney general who will enforce the laws. For all Americans do you believe that he can do that and they will. Well we've seen nothing to demonstrates that in essence as we look at the twenty year history of him serving in the US senate. If we look at the history of what he's done before that again. And Alabama as the state attorney general and as a US attorney in those cases. What was tonight issues and concerns to raise some major concern for us that the N double ACP and others that are seeking civil rights protections in our country. It's very difficult to know how he could do these things when he's demonstrated about his views it isn't as experiences in public life that he would not do. Had not done them and in many cases that we're to Kent Sims very important provisions and protections. All right Hilary Shelton the end Italy CP's Washington bureau director joining us live in Washington DC right now thank you so much for your time mr. shopping. All this is an honor to be with you. Thank you sir back here in New York still with a former mayor of Baltimore Stephanie Rawlings Blake some excellent points race there mr. Shelton those are concerns we're hearing again and again absolute. Thing one of the things that would have been interested to hear from mr. Shelton. Because embrace to same concerns about not really being. Able to be convinced by the answers I'm hearing from senator sessions that. That that what he says he wants to do to be and an attorney general on all Americans that he will be at be curious to hear. From the NAACP or they feel you blindness and it because. What would it look like. What what would he say what could. Sect that senators session say to give them the confidence. That he would enforce the laws for all people with an even hand and not. Continue what they think is a legacy of discrimination and. It is in many ways to have a good faith. Stack he's asking a lot of people to make a right to say that I may have done things in the past few disagreement that may have personally held beliefs. You disagree with that contend with the law but I won't do that moving full. I think that's good. The the underlying tone of this that you know that's the basic question he's asking that they. For the whole hearing united get basically. Give me the benefit of the downton paying you know practicing and I'm an attorney understand the role of an attorney understandable the attorney general. Give me a shot you know you again dislike you semite in we might differ on our policies. But I am a professional. And I get it but you've also is one of those things we beat you trust but it verified so I'm just curious. From some of these groups that have concerns. What would it take to four senator sessions to say to allay some of those consent. The other thing I went to get to take on from your experience was eternally heard again and again. Brought up by both senators Blumenthal and Macy who rodeo. Who we should point out I think he's the only immigrated senator. As well say immigration is this key issue for her as well she's persist from Hawaii. But they product this issue of prosecutorial discretion. Which is to say that your job is not only to enforce the law but you've sorted get to pick which laws you will prioritize to enforce because you can't do every. So how much do you think that will play. In two Powell mr. sessions would serve as attorney general to it to decree have to set an agenda of sorts. You have to set an agenda and you have to have priorities and up prosecute every case. That. Is out there. I have experience with that because we've partnered with the at department that's the US attorney's office on gun crimes involved varsity. We. We're very desperate to. Get used repeat violent offenders. The ones that we know do out there live had very. Had a that track record. Not caring about the community. Through their violence no respect for the community they they've demonstrated that every time they get a chance to to. Be out on the street that they would again. Commit a violent and so. When we weren't seeing the the sentences and the state court that would. Be a deterrent to that behavior we partner with. The US attorney. And we have tons of cases that we wanted them to take but. We understand that they can't they they don't have the resource is to take every single one of those cases so it does matter. That judgment. The attorney general on making the priorities. The you'd think that the attorney general saying these are the types of cases that we will take what is that going to mean when it comes to police reform. What is that going to mean when it comes to consent decrees. I Anke that revisiting that issue of consent decrees because. People are the communities and looking to have more confidence in the police department and one of the pros one of the benefits of a consent decree if it works to. Increase and strengthen confidence in the police department what happens if he decides you know what I'm gonna. Bump that down on the priority list I'm not where we're not going to work to. In force or too soon to work to make sure that there's adequate monitoring for the consent decrees and there's it. It could be a major problems. It's interesting we heard consent degrees come up briefly this morning but not that much apathy comes up again this afternoon. Senator sessions continue to takes questions right now from his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/jurors-hear-closing-arguments-dylann-roof-trial/story?id=44673859,"Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof today told the jury members who will decide his fate, ""I still feel like I had to do it.""

Roof, convicted of opening fire and killing nine churchgoers at a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015, will be sentenced to death or life in prison at the conclusion of this federal trial. The jury began deliberating around 1 p.m. today.

He said today in his closing argument, according to ABC affiliate WCIV, ""I think that it's safe to say that no one in their right mind wants to go into a church and kill people.

""In my confession to the FBI, I told them that I had to do it.""

""But obviously that's not really true. I didn't have to do it, and no one made me do it,"" Roof said, according to WCIV. ""What I meant when I said that was I felt like I had to do it, and I still feel like I had to do it.""

Sketch by Robert Maniscalco

""Anyone who hates anything in their mind has a good reason to hate,"" Roof said to the jury.

The government is asking the jury to sentence Roof to death. In the sentencing phase of the federal trial, the government laid out its case over four days, with testimony from the loved ones of victims. The family members and friends shared personal stories about the victims and described what life has been like since the shooting. Jurors cried in court during some of the emotional testimony.

Roof, 22, who is representing himself, refused to testify and did not call any witnesses to the stand. Last week Roof spoke for less than five minutes in his opening statement, telling the jury there is nothing wrong with him psychologically. He did not apologize for his actions.

The jury must be unanimous to sentence Roof to death; a split decision will yield a life sentence.

He said to the jury today as he concluded his remarks, ""Only one of you has to disagree.""

""I know that at least some of you were asked during jury selection ... if you were willing to stand up for your own opinion,"" Roof said.

In the government's closing argument today, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson laid out the government's argument for the death penalty.

He recounted to the jury how on the night of the shooting, the unsuspecting victims, who had gathered for a Bible study, welcomed Roof, a stranger, to join them. Roof then opened fire on them; the victims were vulnerable targets with their eyes closed in prayer, Richardson said, according to WCIV.

Sketch by Robert Maniscalco

When Roof shot pastor and South Carolina state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, another churchgoer tried to intervene, Richardson said. Then Roof executed them one after another, Richardson said.

Richardson reminded the jury of how Roof stood over survivor Polly Sheppard, told her to shut up and said he was leaving her alive to tell the story.

Tywanza Sanders, who was fatally shot by Roof, told his killer they meant him no harm. Meanwhile, Tywanza Sanders' mother, survivor Felicia Sanders, shielded a small girl from the bullets, and they played dead during the shooting, Richardson said, WCIV reported.

After each shot, Richardson said, Roof paused and considered his next move, WCIV reported.

""He continued to believe it was worth it,"" Richardson said. ""Not one ounce of remorse.""

During the shooting, Clementa Pinckney's wife, Jennifer Pinckney, was in a nearby room with her daughter, hiding in fear. Richardson told the jury that in Jennifer Pinckney's testimony, they ""heard what it was like to be crouched"" under a desk, ""desperately"" trying to keep her 6-year-old daughter quiet.

Richardson said that before the killings, Roof's racist hatred built up for years.

Roof scouted the Emanuel AME Church months before, calling and visiting, Richardson said. After buying the murder weapon with his birthday money, Roof bought enough magazines to have 88 rounds, which had racist symbolism, Richardson said: 88 is an abbreviation for the Nazi salute ""Heil Hitler,"" as ""h"" is the eighth letter in the alphabet.

Besides a website where he shared his message of ""hate,"" Richardson said, Roof mentally and physically prepared for the shooting; he took photos with his gun pointed at the camera and recorded video of his target practice.

""He chose to videotape himself doing it so he could see the very last images these victims would see,"" Richardson said, according to WCIV. ""He wanted to see what he would look like as he stood over them, executing them.""

""This is calculated. Misguided but thoughtful,"" Richardson said, according to WCIV. ""He spent years acquiring this deep hatred, this deep hatred we would all like to believe could not exist in someone. But it does. You've seen it.""

Richardson said that after Roof left the scene of the shooting on June 17, 2015, he ""fully understood the horrific nature"" of his crime. Roof fled on back roads to North Carolina, knowing police were looking for him, and he avoided using his debit card, knowing it could be tracked, Richardson said.

While Roof expressed sorrow to his parents and pity for himself, he didn't shed a tear for the people he killed, Richardson said. Roof showed multiple times that he didn't have remorse, according to Richardson, from his jailhouse manifesto with racist language to the shoes he wore in court during this trial that had racist symbols on them.

Roof was willing to plead guilty if the government would take the death penalty off the table, which Richardson said shows ""that he wants to spend his life in prison, listening to the radio, and writing more racist filth,"" WCIV reported.

Roof's defense attorney David Bruck told the court last month that Roof ""did it,"" but, Bruck added, ""our society does not order the death penalty if there are reasons to choose life.""

The 33 federal counts against Roof included hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death.

Roof also faces a state trial in which he may again face the death penalty. The state trial, which was scheduled to begin this month, has been delayed indefinitely.",abcnews.com,True

Get his task. He isn't famous story about him Clare Boothe Luce the diplomat former congressman Goss and in 1962 he asked her what's on your mind she says. The greater demand the easier it is described him in a single sentence and fined him what's your sentence. What's your sentence what was your fears are I don't care what history thanks. I'm sure he did. I'd like to thank that. Maybe the sentences. President Obama. Believe deeply in this democracy. And the American people because. As I reflect back on what's worked for me in this office. It's been. That I've I've gotten people who maybe. Didn't believe in the process. To get engaged. Ironically I've even gotten the other side that maybe didn't believe in the process to get engaged I gather the father of the Tea Party. I invigorated the grassroots of the Republican Party as well democratic part so. You know a high eight. If it health care got done because there were a lot of people out there. Core professional politician but our citizens who pushed for even when politics was. But did you succeed on your own terms back in the campaign you talked about Ronald Reagan changing the trajectory. Of the country sitting on a fundamentally different path. Do you think you did that I think I did in the sense that there's a whole generation coming up behind us. That. Was engaged inspired. Worked. For change during the course of my presidency saw what was possible. And that generation that's coming. They're not the majority up at but they're going to be the majority so when they if you look at how they value diversity how they. Believe in science how they care about the environment. How they believe in. Not discriminate against people for sexual orientation and of their belief that. We have to work with other countries two. Create a more peaceful world and until we get poverty. That's the majority. Of an entire generation that's coming up behind this thing come out to vote well you know. They came out to vote for me. And and they came out to vote. Where. That. Spirit was touch. The next phase in this part of what I'm interest of doing after presidency. Is to make sure that I'm working with that next generation. So that. They understand. You can't just rely on. Inspiration. There's little perspiration involved in bringing about change to that you have to be organized you have to. Vote. Even when. It's not exciting. I imagine you think the presence he said he had better over time ago. At what point does experienced become a liability would they put this in my mind was reading them by cases memoir he talks about being in the meetings in view. I'm talking about the rate of asylum laws saying maybe he's getting too cautious he's been there too long that are risk. Well what what officers this I believe in term moments presence. Because I think that. That there is no doubt I'm a better president now that I was when I start. I am the best president I've ever been. Over the last year or are too. My team has more effective than it's ever. But what is also true is is that. Number one. This is growing and sustaining. The energy and focus involved in doing a good job. I think starts to. Search gets tougher. The longer you do it. The second thing is the bubbles the bubble and and I think we've done a pretty good job staying in touch with the American people but at a certain point. You can't help but. Lose. Some feel for what's on the ground because. You're not on the ground. And if you didn't think from could win. Case in point. So. So that tells me that there's a utility. In the democracy refreshing itself on an ongoing basis. And and that's part of what I tried describes my team and supporters after the election there's a lot of disappointment. In a white what I said to them is what we we ran our light of the hours. And we did it darn good job. I can document in fact this past week were we've put out memos from every agency. Short what did we do try to be as honest as possible. There's a little hype involved obviously we feel supplied about it but try to be self critical as well you can argue that we didn't get everything done that we want to give them. But I can make a really strong argument and I think prove that by almost every measure the country's better off now but when I start what that means that is. That. If we started here and we're now here just like I describe in health care. Yeah. Somebody comes and they got new ideas maybe ideas that are completely operas are my ideas maybe some of it goes maybe some of that progress goes back. Maybe they think are some things we don't think of in sewing some other areas. We can learn something. But. That just gives. Serve the democracy or an opportunity to test ideas. For those who lost. Catch their breath and regain energy. Reenergize themselves and then get back and they don't know animal makes more progress in. Here's one possible big exception in the first line your bags try to be first African American president. Heart of your promise we first burst on the national scene bringing everyone together. And you look now and most African Americans think you're going backwards on race relations. Over the last eight years what do you say to that. I am absolutely convinced that race relations. On the whole are actually better now than before towns yes B. But. We have greater awareness. Of where we're falling short them when used but let's just take root example of community police relations. And the truth the matter is that. The problem of police shootings and reactions in the community. George you and I are about the same age. I think you remember. What happened in Los Angeles after Rodney King I think you're what the divisions that happened after the OJ trial I think you're. That the notion that somehow any of that is new. Isn't the case what is true though is now we've got a bunch of videos that. What ever side of the issues are wrong raises. The temperature obvious issues and makes people really focused in and and and trying to figure out what exactly is this. And I think that is a healthy thing. I also I'm not so out of touch that I don't see how young people in Iraq today. And what's great like FaceBook like video yesterday well it was horrific. It's not as if that's the first time that the hate crime has taken place. In this country hate crimes have been taken place for. Hundreds of years in this country but it's there on video. Seeing cruelty and callousness. Of that sort. From young people. Is heartbreaking and so naturally if you see a video like that you're gonna save yourself. My god this is horrible. And and rightfully so but that allows us than to talk about. How how how do we break free from those kinds of attitudes during the course my presence. Crime has been the lowest it's been charged since the sixties. You wouldn't know it if you're watching TV you're looking at the Internet and you certainly when north. Listening to this past campaign. They there are some exceptions Chicago my hometown in particular. But overall in the country there's a much safer place than it is today. And so. We have to recognize. We've got some big problems on race just like we get still big problems on crime just like we're got big problems on just about everything. But we also have to make sure the we've draw confidence from the progress that we have made because otherwise. You get in this cycle of cynicism. And you also you get into. Unrealistic expectations where you expect that. What we're gonna eliminate racism like that after Obama collected how could there be any racism. You know that that that was never realistic expectation of one final question. That very strong memory of your inaugural. In that moment your walking out of the capital. People president elect of United States Barack. Bates whole club are. People often first and pause. And take it all. You remember what you're thinking feeling at that moment. I was just thinking. To myself let's make sure I don't screw this. I think there is a a do people always talk about a quarter. I don't care how quarry. JFK gave private greatest inauguration speech ever that first time but I get to you when he first walked out there respect. Goodness gracious. This is this is this has been. And I better be up to protest. I think the second inauguration. You may were call. I finish my speech. Was walking out and I decided you know what let me turn. Remember. And what I remember thinking. At that point having gone through both the ups and downs of my first four years. And seeing this sea of people. Was. What a remarkable country business and how lucky am. And that. That we live in a place where. The son of single mom. Not born and any kind of fame or fortune and a pretty remote state. Somehow. Can end up. Being in a position to to make a difference. And at that moment just a little under two weeks from now. When presently have finished his dios. Power passes from you'd hand what emotionally be left with. It's hard to say it's hard to anticipate I can't tell you what I'm feeling right now is. That I'm. Busier than I expected these last two weeks. A great deal of emotion around. The people. But I've worked worked and the gratitude I feel for the sacrifices they've made on behalf of the American people but also on behalf for me personally. And I think I will still. Feel that same appreciation. For. What. Churchill and others it's. Is the worst former governments that all the alternatives. To present thank you very much thank you. Just twelve days left another president coming in we'll be right back.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-president-barack-obama/story?id=44630949,"WALK-AND-TALK INTERVIEW

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President, thank you for doing this. As we're walking towards your office I have to think you're going to miss this short commute.

BARACK OBAMA: [laughs] I am, it's one of the biggest benefits of being president that you really don't think about until you get here. I have never had to travel more than thirty seconds from home to office, and it's because of that that I've been able to maintain, you know, really a family life that has nurtured and sustained me during this time.

STEPHANOPOULOS: How long did it take for the White House to feel like home though?

OBAMA: You know, it, it took shorter, I think, for us, just because when you've got little kids, and you're tucking them in –

STEPHANOPOULOS: It's home.

OBAMA: It's home, right? When you open a door and they're in their pajamas and they're, you know, wrestling with you and asking you, you know, to read to them and stuff, you know it starts feeling like home pretty quick. Not to mention having a mother-in-law upstairs, and the dog, and now two. It feels even more like home now because you have all these memories that were formed watching your kids grow up.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You know you talk about the kids, and I know you all were pretty, a little bit apprehensive coming into the White House, they were young. Was it a good experience for them?

OBAMA: You know, you don't know how it would have turned out if they'd grown up in Chicago instead, and a more normal environment. All I can say is they have turned out to be terrific young women. We were concerned mostly about whether they'd develop an attitude, right?

STEPHANOPOULOS: How not, yeah.

OBAMA: And they are, you know, sweet, kind, funny, smart, respectful people, and they treat everybody with respect. That's not just the biases of a parent. You know, we feel pretty good when we hear back from friends, cause they still have sleepovers and they go to other folks houses and when the parents say, oh you know, Malia, she's just so sweet, or Sasha helped to pick up the dishes, what is it that you're doing to –

STEPHANOPOULOS: They never complain about it?

OBAMA: You know, they complained about Secret Service as they became teenagers, and Secret Service has done the very best job they could accommodating them, so it hasn't restricted any of their activities, but as you might imagine, if you're a teenager having a couple of people with microphones –

STEPHANOPOULOS: Always on your tail, yeah.

OBAMA: and guns always following you around, that could grate on them. But you know, they've handled it with grace and I give Michelle most of the credit for how well they've done, but I also just think they are graceful, good young, young women.

STEPHANOPOULOS: This part of the White House is so iconic.

OBAMA: It's my favorite, yeah. This walk. It--it doesn't matter what time of day it is, in some ways I feel more attached to this walk even than the Oval Office.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe it.

OBAMA: Yeah. There's something about these steps and thinking about everybody who's walked here and all the business that's been done here.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And business gets done on this walk.

OBAMA: Yes, exactly. And even when you go up this ramp, and you think about FDR wheeling himself up, you know, got a little cigarette holder in his mouth, and it, that, that awe that you feel, that reverence that you feel for the place never entirely leaves.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well that's one of the things I was going ask you, because I know you kept in touch with people by reading those letters every day.

OBAMA: Yes.

STEPHANOPOULOS: How did you keep in touch with the presidency?

OBAMA: It's an interesting question. I, more than anything, obviously the presidency is the people, and it's been interesting the emotions in the last few months. What you realize is that you may never have the team that is together in the same way, under the same pressures, and the attachments that you make to folks from your chief of staff down to –

STEPHANOPOULOS: It's the ultimate bunker.

OBAMA: It is, and the people here have been extraordinary. We had a farewell dinner for some of my senior staff, and generally everybody likes to talk about how cool I was. I had trouble getting through just a few remarks, because not only do you appreciate the sacrifices they've made and the hours they've kept and the soccer games they missed and the birthday parties, but I also had a lot of young people who came in here, and this probably, you know, echoes with you, in your own experience, you were young when you got here.

STEPHANOPOULOS: It didn't feel like it when I left.

OBAMA: Yeah, but you know, now suddenly you got members of your team who were 23, 24. They've met their wives here, or their husbands here.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And you have a lot of eight year people.

OBAMA: Yeah, and you, and they start bringing in their kids, who you think should be babies and now are in second grade or something, and you've watched them grow up. So I think what ends up happening is you end up maintaining those networks and those contacts, but the concentrated interactions and experience that you have here, I don't think, I don't expect you can duplicate anyplace else.

STEPHANOPOULOS: We're about to walk into the Oval, and I was just wondering, the big gut-check decisions, did you make them in there or up in the Treaty Room at home?

OBAMA: I think I made them on this walk sometimes. You know, there are times where I'd say the Oval Office, you use to gather the facts. The decisions you probably make late at night, or at least I do, I'm kind of a night owl, up there. But there are some times where you think you've made a decision, but during that walk, where you're announcing the decision, you've just got to make sure that, you're prepared to live with it, because as you know George, a lot of these decisions are not-- the outcomes are uncertain.

OVAL OFFICE INTERVIEW

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: As you said, it is very busy, newsy day here, that shooting down in Fort Lauderdale this afternoon. Do we know enough now to know if it was an act of terror?

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: As a general rule, until I've got all the information, George, I don't wanna comment on it other than just to say how heartbroken we are for the families who've been affected. These kinds of tragedies have happened too often during the eight years that I've been president. The pain, the grief, the shock that they must be going through is enormous. I've asked me staff to reach out to the mayor down there and make sure that coordination between the state and local officials is what it should be. But I think we'll find out over the next 24 hours exactly how this happened and what motivated this individual.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And also just a few minutes ago, this intelligence report came out on the Russian activities, declassified version. Pretty stark opening sentences. ""Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign. We further assess that Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-Elect Trump."" President Putin was trying to elect Trump?

OBAMA: Well, I think the report is very clear. Number one, the Russians sought to interfere with the election process-- that the cyber hacking that took place by the Russians was part of that campaign, and that they had a clear preference in terms of outcomes.

What-- what I've repeatedly said is that you know, our intelligence communities spend a lot of time and effort gathering a lot of strands and a lot of data. There are times where they're very cautious and they say, ""We think this is what happened, but we're not certain.""

STEPHANOPOULOS: You're saying high confidence here--

OBAMA: The-- this time they've got high confidence, and having seen some of the underlying sources and information that they're basing this on I stand fully behind the-- the report.

STEPHANOPOULOS: What does that tell you about what President Putin is trying to do right now? And I-- I think back to 2012 when Mitt Romney talked about Russia being the number one geostrategic threat, you kinda dismissed him in the second debate--

OBAMA: I did.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Did you underestimate Vladimir Putin?

OBAMA: You know, I don't think I underestimated him, but I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation for cyber hacking and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating.

And so part of the reason that I ordered this report was not simply to re-litigate what happened over the last several months, but rather to make sure that we understand this is something that Putin has been doing for quite some time in Europe, initially in the former satellite states where there are a lot of Russian speakers, but increasingly in Western democracies.

There are gonna be elections coming up among our NATO allies that we have to pay attention to. I anticipate that this kind of thing can happen again here. And so in addition to the report assessing what exactly happened, what we have also done is to make sure that the Department of Homeland Security and our intelligence teams are working with the various folks who run our elections.

And one of the things that I've urged the president-elect to do is to develop a strong working relationship with the intelligence community and I think it's important that Congress, on a bipartisan basis, work with the next administration looking forward to make sure that this kind of influence is minimized--

STEPHANOPOULOS: He-- he met with the intelligence leaders this afternoon.

OBAMA: Yeah--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Praised their work at the top. Still didn't seem to accept their conclusions fully. He talked about Russia and China and-- and other countries. They made no assessment on whether this affected the outcome of the election. He said very clearly it had no effect on the outcome. What do you think?

OBAMA: You know, I think there are a lot of factors going into an election. I think the bottom line is-- is that Donald Trump is gonna be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States of America. And it's not necessarily profitable to sort of try to untangle all the different factors that went into it.

The issue here is you have I think the-- the clear example of how, if we're not vigilant foreign countries can have an impact on the political debate in the United States in ways that might not have been true 10, 20, 30 years ago in-- in part because of the way news is transmitted and in part because so many people are skeptical of mainstream news organizations that-- everything's true and everything's false. You know nothing-- nothing is-- is settled. Everything is contested.

In that kind of environment, where there's so much skepticism about information that's coming in, we're gonna have to spend a lot more time thinking about how do we protect our democratic process and as I've been saying for years, we're gonna have to spend a lot more time on cyber security. That's one of the reasons why I'd ordered a commission--

STEPHANOPOULOS: But bottom line, this time Vladimir Putin got what he wanted.

OBAMA: Well-- look, I-- I think that what is true is that the Russians intended to meddle, and they meddled. And it could be another country in the future. It could be another election where you know, the-- the alignments between Republicans and Democrats are different than they were this time and—and--who a foreign country prefers.

And that's why I hope that this does not continue to be viewed purely through a partisan lens. I think there are Republicans as well as Democrats who are concerned about this. And the-- the two things we need to do, George-- number one, we have to spend a lot more time, energy, resources on cyber security. And it makes--what makes this difficult is because it's not just a government problem. It is a private sector and government problem. And there's gotta be a lot more cooperation. That was one of the key recommendations of this commissions that I got a report from just a few weeks ago.

And the second thing we have to do is to make sure that all of us think about how we approach our elections and our democracy not only to secure them from vote tampering, but also to make sure that we understand when propaganda is being churned through the system.

And-- and one of the things I-- I'll be honest with you, George. One of the things that I am concerned about is the degree to which we've seen a lot of commentary lately where there were, there are Republicans or pundits or cable commentators who seemed to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans because those fellow Americans were Democrats. That cannot be.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Does that include the president-elect?

OBAMA: Well, what I will say is that--and I said this right after the election--we have to remind ourselves we're on the same team. Vladimir Putin's not on our team. If we get to a point where people in this country feel more affinity with a leader who is an adversary and view the United States and our way of life as a threat to him, then we're gonna have bigger problems than just cyber hacking.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You-- you've talked to the president-elect Trump now several times over the course of this transition. What have you tried to impress on him about the job?

OBAMA: Well, as I've said before, the-- the conversations have been cordial. He has been open to suggestions, and the main thing that I've tried to transmit is that there's a different between governing and campaigning, so that what he has to appreciate is as soon as you walk into this office after you've been sworn in, you're now in charge of the largest organization on Earth.

You can't manage it the way you would manage a family business. You can't manage it the way you would manage a Senate office. I-- I was a senator before I became president. And so you have to have a strong team around you. You have to have respect for institutions and the process to make good decisions because you are inherently reliant on other folks.

So when I talked to him about-- our intelligence agencies, what I've said to him is-- is that there are gonna be times where you've got raw intelligence that comes in and in my experience, over eight years, the intelligence community is pretty good about saying, ""Look, we can't say for certain what this means."" But there are gonna be times where the only way you can make a good decision is if you have confidence that the process is working, and the people that you put in charge are giving you their very best assessments.

STEPHANOPOULOS: How has he impressed you?

OBAMA: You know, he is somebody who I think is very engaging and gregarious.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you like him?

OBAMA: You know, I've enjoyed the conversations that we've had. He is somebody who I think is not lacking in confidence, which is I think--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Some say that about you too.

OBAMA: Well, that's what I was saying. It-- it's-- it's probably a prerequisite for the job, or at least you have to have enough craziness to think that you can do the job. I-- I think that he has not spent a lot of time sweating the details of, you know, all the policies that--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Does that worry you?

OBAMA: Well, I think that can be both a strength and a weakness. I think it depends on how he approaches it. If he-- if it gives him fresh eyes, then that can be valuable. But it also requires you knowing what you don't know and putting in place people who do have the kinds of experience and background and-- and knowledge that can inform good decision making. And look, I-- I-- I think it's fair to say that he and I are-- are sort of opposites in some ways.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Voters often do that, don't they?

OBAMA: Yeah. Yeah. But so-- so let's say I'm on the-- the policy wonk end of the spectrum. As much as I can dive into a briefing book and really work to-- to master various subjects that come before my desk, I'm still not an expert on a huge amount of the stuff that we work on. But I do make sure that I've got people who are experts that are helping me make the best decisions possible.

And if you don't have good people, and you don't have a good process and you don't have, at some level, the basic reverence for this office, and an understanding of the-- the incredible responsibilities and obligations, then, I think you can get into trouble.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You're also not much of a tweeter. He was on a tirade (LAUGH) this morning, sent out a lot of tweets early this morning. Clearly, according to him and his people, he's gonna keep on doing it when he's sitting there behind that desk. Good idea?

OBAMA: On the one hand information is--is moving quick, and-- I-- I-- or-- or the way in which people consume information is changing so fast. Clearly this worked for him, and it gives him a direct connection to a lot of the people that voted for him.

I-- in-- I've said to him, and I think others have said to him that the day that he is the President of the United States, there are world capitals and financial markets and people all around the world who take really seriously what he says, and in a way that's just not true before you're actually sworn in as president.

STEPHANOPOULOS: People take seriously what you say as well. And during the campaign-- many of your speeches you say, ""All the progress we've made in the last eight years go out the window if we don't win."" Still think that?

OBAMA: No. (SIGH) I think that the-- the risk to all the progress we've made was at stake in the election because not just the president-elect but a lot of members of Congress, including now the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader, have said that their principal agenda was to undo a lot of this progress. But as I've been talking about over the last several days when it comes to health care, the gains that we've made are there. Twenty million people have health insurance that didn't have it before. The uninsured rate is the lowest it's ever been.

The rise in health care costs since Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act was passed, have been at their lowest rate in 50 years. Those savings have extended the Medicare trust fund by 11 years. So we-- we've got-- we've got a baseline of facts. Here-- here-- here's-- here's where we were, here's where we are now. So it is true theoretically that all that progress can be undone, and suddenly 20 million people or more don't have health insurance.

But as I think Republicans now are recognizing that's-- may not be what the American people, including even Trump voters, are looking for. And my hope is that the president-elect, members of Congress from both parties look at, ""Where have we objectively made progress, where things are working better?"" Don't undo things just because I did them. I don't have pride of authorship. I said today in a forum on health care if the Republicans can come up with a system that insures more people cheaper, better I will be the first one--

STEPHANOPOULOS: And I can tell by your smile you don't think they can do it?

OBAMA: Well, I'm skeptical that they can do it mainly because for seven years now, including when we first tried to pass health care, I said to 'em, ""Okay, if-- if this doesn't work tell me what does."" In this room I remember having meetings with Republican senators who initially had been trying to engage but saw that the politics of ‘no’ were growing inside the Republican Party. And I remember having a conversation in the Oval Office with one of those senators who was-- was starting to get a little sheepish about (LAUGH) what compromises might-- garner his support.

And finally I asked him, ""Is there any changes I could make that would get you to support this?"" And he said, ""Probably not, Mr. President,"" which was a nice change in terms of just candor. But what-- what that means then is, is that now the burden is to take a look. All right, if-- if-- if-- if you think that we've overregulated in the environmental space what I can show you is that we have tripled the amount of wind power in this country, increased by tenfold the amount of solar power. We are producing as much oil and gas as we've ever produced.

Gas is at two bucks a gallon. Utility rates and electricity rates are low. So you will, it seems like the energy policy we got right now is working pretty good. If you think you got a better idea in terms of how to approach this that's not gonna result in more pollution, and more asthma, and more illness then put your ideas out there. But don't just oppose things because, ""This was Obama's agenda.""

STEPHANOPOULOS: Sounds like that's what's happening right now.

OBAMA: Well, that's what's happening at the moment. But you know, the American people-- are-- are both anxious for change. We're in a time of-- of flux. You know, the-- the globe is shrinking, the inform age-- information age is-- is bringing a lot of changes. People are anxious about their future and their children's futures. But they don't want folks to be reckless and they don't want this town to just be tit-for-tat. And-- you know, one of the gratifying things, I think, about the end of my presidency-- even though admittedly-- my successor ran against a lot of what we stood for, is when you look at the individual issues and the progress that we've made on a lot of those issues, we got the support of a pretty decent majority. Even on health care what you've seen is a lot of stories surfacing lately about people who said, ""Well, I voted for Trump but I don't think he's really gonna take away my health care--""

STEPHANOPOULOS: So is Obamacare gonna survive?

OBAMA: I think it will. Or-- it may be called something else. And-- and as I said (LAUGH) I don't-- I don't mind. If in fact the Republicans make some modifications, some of which I may have been seeking previously, but they wouldn't cooperate because they didn't wanna-- make the system work, and re-label it as Trumpcare, I'm fine with that. Because what I'm thinking about are the millions of people, many of whom write me very personal letters-- ""Dear Mr. President: I did not vote for you. I was against Obamacare. And then my son who didn't have health insurance signed up and we just found out that he had an illness. And thankfully he's now covered, otherwise he might not have gotten treatment and I might have lost my house.""

""Dear Mr. President: You know, my husband got hooked on opioids and thank God we have coverage and were able to access substance abuse. He's clean now, he's gone back to work."" You have people around the country who are benefitting from the steps that we've taken and as long as they continue to get helped, then at least I'll know in my own mind that the work we did here had a lasting impact.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You've often said that your toughest day in office was the day of the Newtown shootings. What was your toughest decision?

OBAMA: (SIGH) Toughest decision was early in my presidency when I ordered 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan. As somebody who had run to end a large troop presence overseas. Now, I had said from the start that I thought Iraq was a mistake, that we should have stayed focused on Afghanistan. I think it was the right decision because the Taliban at that point had gotten a lot of momentum before I'd gotten into office, partly because we hadn't been paying attention as much as we needed to to Afghanistan.

And since that time we've been able to build up the Afghan security forces and stabilize it. But that was the first time in which I looked out at a crowd of West Point graduates and knew that some of those might not come back because of-- because of that decision--

STEPHANOPOULOS: How disappointing --then how disappointing is it to you that even though it's far fewer, there would still be troops in Afghanistan, still be troops in Iraq as you leave?

OBAMA: Yeah. Well, one of the things that I've learned, and I think we've all learned, is that we are not going to get the kind of decisive, permanent victories in this fight against terrorism that we would get from fighting another country. We're not going to get that MacArthur/Emperor moment, because by definition, even after decimating Al Qaeda in the Fata, even after taking out bin Laden there's still people there who have both the--the interest and the capacity if we don't maintain vigilance to strike against the United States.

And these are still countries that are fragile enough that we're gonna have to partner with them in some way. But what we have done, I think, is build a model from a lot of hard lessons in Afghanistan and Iraq-- but in other places around the world, where we are working with them in an advisory capacity.

It still puts burden on some troops of ours who are there as advisors and facilitators. But we don't have this huge footprint, we are less likely to be targeted as, you know, occupiers. And if you look at the current Mosul campaign again-- against ISIL, for example the-- the few thousand troops that we have there to support that effort allows the Iraqi military to move forward in an effective way.

Now, would they do it as fast as if we had 50,000 or 100,000 Marines in there? Obviously not. But it does give us the ability to make sure that we are strengthening those folk who are interested in building up their countries rather than destroying them, and doing so in a way that is sustainable and doesn't put a constant burden on the amazing men and women that we've got in uniform.

STEPHANOPOULOS: What has to be a disappointment on the home front is that-- it looks like the Democratic Party got pretty hollowed out on your watch, about 1,000 seats lost in the Congress, Senate, governors, state houses. Is that on you?

OBAMA: I take some responsibility on that. I-- I think that some of it was circumstances. If you look at-- what happened, I came in in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And unlike FDR who waited-- well, didn't take office until about three years into the Great Depression, it was happening just as I was elected.

I think we did a really good job in saving this economy and putting us back on the track of growth. But what that meant is in 2010 there were a lot of folks who were still out of work. There were a lot of folks who had lost their homes or saw their home values plummet, their 401k's plummet.

And we were just at the beginnings of a recovery. And the, you know, whoever is president at that point is gonna get hit and his party's gonna get hit. That then means that suddenly you've got a redistricting in which a lot of state legislatures are now Republican. They draw lines that give a huge structural advantage in subsequent elections.

So-- so some of this was circumstances. But what I think that what is also true is that partly because my docket was really full here, so I couldn't be both chief organizer of the Democratic Party and function as Commander-in-Chief and President of the United States. We did not begin what I think needs to happen over the long haul, and that is rebuild the Democratic Party at the ground level.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Part of your job now?

OBAMA: Well, I think that it's something that I have an interest in. As-- as you know, George, my entire career, I started as a community organizer. Every one of my campaigns was premised on getting new people involved. And if there's a theme in my public career it's that if ordinary people get involved then good things happen. So I want to see the Democratic Party move in that direction. And what that means is that we aren't just micro-targeting to eke out presidential victories; it means that we're showing up in places where right now we're not winning a lot.

And if you look at sort of how politics has divided itself here in this country, the big divide right now is between urban areas, which have become increasingly Democratic, and rural or exurban areas that feel as if they're being ignored. And if Democrats are not showing up in those places, even if you-- even if you're not gonna win right away but if you're not in there at least making an argument that, ""Hey, you know what? It's the Democrats who are trying to raise your minimum wage.

""It's the Democrats who are trying to make sure you got health care or that your health care costs aren't killing ya. It's Democrats who were making sure that your kids aren't drinking polluted water. It's Democrats who are trying to reign in the banks if they engage in excesses so that you don't end up having a problem."" If we're not there making the argument then the-- the cultural gulf that Republicans try to exploit saying, ""Ah, these city slickers: they're all looking down on you, they don't care about you. They're just trying to help out their various special interest constituencies,"" that argument ends up being successful. And so we've got to do a better job of showing up. And I was able to do that when I was the candidate. But I have not-- I've not seen or-- or presided over that kind of systematic outreach that I think needs to happen.

STEPHANOPOULOS: This is JFK's desk, right?

OBAMA: Yeah. He used it.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Famous story about him: Clare Booth Luce, the diplomat, former Congresswoman goes to him in 1962. He asks her, ""What's on your mind?"" She says, ""The greater the man, the easier it is to describe him in a single sentence."" And she said to him, ""What's your sentence?"" What's your sentence?

OBAMA: What was JFK's answer?

STEPHANOPOULOS: “I don't care what history thinks.""

OBAMA: (LAUGH) I'm sure he did. (LAUGH) (PAUSE) I'd like to think that-- maybe the sentence is-- ""President Obama believed deeply in this democracy and the American people."" Because-- as I reflect back on what's worked for me in this office it's been that I've-- I've gotten people who maybe didn't believe in the process to get engaged. Ironically, I've even gotten the other side that maybe didn't believe in the process to get engaged. I, you know, I-- I-- I'm-- I gather I'm the-- the father of the Tea Party. I-- I invigorated the grassroots in the Republican Party as well as the Democratic Party. So, you know, I-- if-- health care got done because there were a lot of people out there who aren't professional politicians, but are citizens, who pushed for it even when the politics was hard.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But did you succeed on your own terms? Back in the campaign you talked about Ronald Reagan changing the trajectory of the country, setting on a fundamentally different path. Do you think you did that?

OBAMA: I think I did in the sense that there's a whole generation coming up behind us that was engaged, inspired, worked for change during the course of my presidency, saw what was possible. And that-- that-- that generation, it's coming. They're not the majority yet but they're gonna be the majority soon. And when you look at what they believe in, when they, you look at how they value diversity, how they believe in science, how they care about the environment, how they believe in, you know, everybody getting a fair shot, how they believe in not discriminating against people for sexual orientation and you know, their belief that we have to work with other countries to create a more peaceful world and-- and to alleviate poverty, that's the majority of-- of an entire generation that's coming up behind us.

STEPHANOPOULOS: They didn't come out to vote?

OBAMA: Well, you know, they came out to vote for me. And they came out to vote where that-- spirit was touched. The next phase and this is part of what I'm interested in doing after I get out of the presidency is to make sure that I'm working with that next generation so that they understand you can't just rely on inspiration. There's a little perspiration involved in bringing about change too. That you have to be organized, that you have to vote even when it's not exciting.

You have to be involved during midterm elections, you have to care about what happens at a school board level. You have to be involved in terms of what's happening in your local neighborhood and what issues are there. So-- so I think that there's gonna be a lot of work to do in order to consolidate the transformations that I was interested in. But I--but the spirit's there and-- and that's not just my imagination. I think if you look at surveys and attitudes among young people, you see it.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I imagine you think the presidency's something you get better at over time?

OBAMA: You do.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But at what point does the experience become a liability? And what put this in my mind was reading Bob Gates' memoir. And he talks about being in the meetings with you and talking about the raid on Osama bin Laden, saying, ""Maybe he's getting too cautious; he's been there too long."" Is that a risk?

OBAMA: Well, what I'll say is this: I believe in term limits for presidents because I think that there is no doubt I'm a better president now than I was when I start. In fact, I-- I would argue that I-- I am the best president I've ever been over the last year or-- or two. My team is more effective than it's ever been. But what is also true is that number one, this is grueling. And sustaining the energy and focus involved in doing a good job I think starts to-- starts to gets tougher the longer you do it.

The second thing is, the bubble's the bubble. And-- and I think we've done a pretty good job staying in touch with the American people. But at a certain point you can't help but lose some feel for what's on the ground because you're not on the ground and-- and--

STEPHANOPOULOS: You didn't think Donald Trump could win?

OBAMA: Case in point. So-- so that tells me that there is-- there-- there's a utility in the democracy refreshing itself on an ongoing basis. And-- and that's part of what I tried to describe to my team and supporters after the election, there was a lot of disappointment. You know, I--what I've said to them is, ""Look, we-- we ran our leg of the race and we did a darn good job."" I can document-- in fact, this past week we're-- we've put out memos from every agency showing what did we do. Try to be as honest as possible. There's a little hype involved obviously. It's spin because it's our agencies. We-- we feel some pride about it. But tried to be self-critical as well. And-- and I can honestly say, George-- and I don't think there's a lot of dispute for this. You-- you can argue that we didn't get everything done that we wanted to get done, but I can make a really strong argument, and I think prove, that by almost every measure the country's better off now than when I started.

STEPHANOPOULOS: W--

OBAMA: And so just to finish the thought, what that means then is that if we started here and we're now here, just like I described in health care, yeah, somebody comes in, they got new ideas, maybe ideas that are completely opposite of my ideas. Maybe some of it goes, maybe some of that progress goes back. Maybe they think of some things we didn't think of, and so in some other areas-- we can learn something.

But that just gives sort of the democracy an opportunity to test ideas, for those who lost to catch their breath, regain energy, reenergize themselves and then get back in the arena, and then we'll make some more progress in the future.

STEPHANOPOULOS: One-- one possible big exception: In the first line of your biography it's probably going to be ""first African-American president.""

OBAMA: Yeah.

STEPHANOPOULOS: The heart of your promise when you first burst on the national scene, bringing everyone together. And you look now and most African-Americans think we've gone backwards on race relations over the last eight years. What do you say to that?

OBAMA: I-- (SIGH) I am absolutely convinced that race relations on the whole are actually better now than they were 20 years--

STEPHANOPOULOS: Better now?

OBAMA: Yes. But we have greater awareness of where we're falling short than we used to. Let's just take the example of-- community police relations. I mean, the truth of the matter is that-- that the problem of police shootings and reactions in the community-- George, you and I are about the same age. I-- I think you remember what happened in Los Angeles after Rodney King, I think you remember what-- the divisions that happened after the O.J. trial. I think you -- the-- the notion that somehow any of that is new isn't the case.

What is true, though, is now we've got a bunch of videos that whatever side of the issue you're on, raises the temperature on these issues and makes people really focused and-- and-- and-- and trying to figure out, ""What exactly is this?"" And I think that is a healthy thing. But I also-- I'm not so out of touch that I don't see how young people interact today. And what's--

STEPHANOPOULOS: That horrific Facebook Live video yesterday--

OBAMA: And, well, it was horrific. And that's an example of something that it's not as if that's the first time that a hate crime has taken place in this country. Hate crimes have been taking place for hundreds of years in this country, but it's there on video. And the-- the-- the sort of seeing cruelty and callousness of that sort from young people is heartbreaking. And so naturally if you see a video like that you're gonna say to yourself, ""My God, this is horrible,"" and-- and rightfully so.

But that allows us then to talk about how-- how-- how do we break free from those kinds of attitudes? And I think that we are in a position to continue to make progress, but it's gonna require us to both recognize what the problems are, also recognize the-- the-- the progress we've made. Last point I'd make on this, since we're on criminal justice: During the course of my presidency crime has been the lowest it's been probably since the '60s.

But you wouldn't know it if you were watching TV or looking at the internet, and you certainly wouldn't know it, listening to this past campaign. There are some exceptions: Chicago, my hometown, in particular. But overall in the country this is a much safer place than it used to be.

But if you ask the average person they'd tell ya, ""Naw, it's much more dangerous,"" despite the fact that violent crime has dropped precipitously. And so we have to recognize we've got some big problems on race, just like we got still big problems on crime, just like we got big problems on just about everything. But we also have to make sure that we've-- draw confidence from the progress that we have made, 'cause otherwise, you get into this cycle of cynicism.

And you're also-- and I warn young people that I interact with about this-- you get into unrealistic expectations where you think that, ""Oh, we're gonna eliminate racism like that. After Obama's elected how could there be any racism?"" (LAUGH) Well, you know, that-- that-- that was never a realistic expectation.

STEPHANOPOULOS: I have one final question. I have a very strong memory of your inaugural. In that moment you're walking out of the Capitol, you see them all for the first time and you kind of pause and take it all in. Do you remember what you were thinking and feeling at that moment?

OBAMA: The two inaugurations were different. The first inauguration I was thinking to myself, ""Let's make sure I don't screw this up."" I think there is-- people always talk about how cool I am. I don't care how cool you are. JFK gave probably the greatest inauguration speech ever that first time, but I guarantee you when he first walked out there he was thinking, ""Goodness gracious (LAUGH) this is-- this is-- this is big and I better be up to the task."" I think the second inauguration you may recall I-- I finished my speech—

STEPHANOPOULOS: You turned around--

OBAMA:--I was walking out and I decided, ""You know what? Let me turn back and-- and remember this."" And-- and what I remember thinking at that point, having gone through both the ups and downs of my first four years, and seeing the sea of people was, ""What a remarkable country this is and how lucky am I that-- that we live in a place where the son of a single mom, not born into any kind of fame or fortune, in a pretty remote state somehow can end up be in a position to-- to make a difference.""

STEPHANOPOULOS: And at that moment, just a little under two weeks from now, when President-elect Trump finishes the oath, power passes from you to him, what emotion will you be left with?

OBAMA: It's hard to say. It's hard to anticipate. I can tell you what I'm feeling right now is that I'm busier than I expected these last two weeks. A great deal of emotion around the people that I've worked with and the gratitude I feel for the sacrifices they've made on behalf of the American people, but also on behalf of me personally. And I think I will still feel that same appreciation for what Churchill and others have said is the worst form of government except all the alternatives.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President, thank you very much.

OBAMA: Thank you.",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/US/bail-denied-suspects-accused-alleged-facebook-torture-video/story?id=44604218,"An Illinois judge has denied bail for the four suspects charged in connection with a Facebook video that allegedly showed them torturing an 18-year-old man whom police characterized as having ""mental health challenges.""

The suspects' public defenders were seeking that they be released on a ""reasonable bail,"" but Cook County Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil denied the request. When announcing her decision, Kuriakos Ciesil stared at the defendants and asked, ""Where was the sense of decency that each of you should've had when you were allegedly committing this crime?""

The suspects looked back at the judge but did not answer her question.

During the ordeal, 18-year-old suspect Jordan Hill of Carpentersville had contacted the victim's mother seeking $300 in cash, prosecutors said in court.

Hill and the three other suspects -- Tesfaye Cooper, 18, of Chicago, Brittany Covington, 18, of Chicago and Tanishia Covington, 24, of Chicago -- were arrested and charged with hate crime, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Hill, Cooper and Covington were additionally charged with residential burglary. Hill also was charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle, according to the Cook County State Attorney’s Office in Illinois.

On Wednesday, the suspects allegedly broadcast a 30-minute Facebook Live video that showed them violently assaulting the victim, who had his mouth taped shut.

At one point, the victim is threatened with a knife and told to curse President-elect Donald Trump.

""Say f--- Donald Trump,"" someone is heard saying in the video.

""F--- Donald Trump,"" the victim says.

In another part of the video, someone is heard yelling, ""F--- white people."" Chicago Police Cmdr. Kevin Duffin said Thursday that the ""primary reason"" the suspects were charged with the hate crime was because of racial slurs and references to the victim's mental capacity heard in the video.

The suspects admitted in video statements to police to beating and kicking the victim as well as making him drink toilet water, Duffin said.

The victim had been reported missing by his parents Monday after they dropped him off on New Year's Eve at a McDonald's in Streamwood, a suburb northwest of Chicago, under the premise that he would be spending the night with Hill, who police said was an acquaintance of the victim's from school.

After two days of visiting friends, Hill and the victim went to the home of the Covington sisters, where the police said the assault took place. The ordeal seen in the video began after a ""play fight"" between the victim and Hill escalated, police said.

The victim was able to escape after the sisters retaliated against a neighbor on a lower floor who complained about the noise by kicking in her door. Officers responding to a damaged property call found the victim on the street wearing shorts, flip flops and a tank top that was inside out and backward, despite the frigid temperatures.

In a press conference Thursday evening, the victim's family said he is doing ""as well as he could be at this time.""

http://abcnews.go.com/US/alleged-chicago-hate-crime-streamed-live-facebook/story?id=44596745,"Four suspects facing hate crime charges made their first appearance in a Chicago court this afternoon after they allegedly kidnapped and tortured a man, whom a police official characterized as having “mental health challenges,” while streaming it live on Facebook.

The Illinois suspects — identified by prosecutors as Jordan Hill, 18, of Carpentersville; Tesfaye Cooper, 18, of Chicago; Brittany Covington, 18, of Chicago; and Tanishia Covington, 24, of Chicago — were arrested and charged with hate crime, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Hill, Cooper and Brittany Covington were additionally charged with residential burglary. Hill also was charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle, according to the Cook County State Attorney’s Office.

The four appeared in Central Bond Court at the Leighton Criminal Courts Building on Friday afternoon. They have not yet entered pleas.

Here’s what we know so far about the investigation and how the alleged incident unfolded:

Victim With ‘Mental Health Challenges’ Reported Missing

The victim, an 18-year-old man who a police official said has “mental health challenges,” was dropped off by his parents at a McDonald’s restaurant in Streamwood, a suburb northwest of Chicago, on Saturday. They believed he would be spending the night with Hill, his friend and school acquaintance, according to Cmdr. Kevin Duffin of the Chicago Police Department.

Hill allegedly picked up the victim in a stolen van, which the victim assumed was Hill’s. The two drove to Chicago’s West Side, where they visited with friends for two days and slept in the van overnight, Duffin said.

The victim’s parents went to Streamwood police and reported him missing on Monday night. They told police they had not heard from their son since Saturday when they dropped him off, according to the Streamwood Police Department.

Victim Allegedly Bound and Tortured in ‘Sickening’ Video

On Tuesday the victim and Hill went to the apartment of the Covingtons, who are sisters. Several hours later, a “play fight” between the victim and Hill escalated, and the suspects bound him and began to assault him, Duffin said.

“That’s when racial slurs and [references] to his mental capacity starts coming out,” Duffin said at a news conference Thursday. “That’s primarily one of the reasons why they were charged with the hate crime.”

Video of the incident was posted live on Facebook but was later removed. The social media company said it “does not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook.”

The video shows the victim, a white man, with his mouth taped shut as his captors appear to repeatedly assault him.

“It’s sickening,” Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson said of the incident during a news conference Wednesday. “It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat someone like that.”

In the video, someone is heard yelling, “F--- white people.” And at one point, the victim was threatened with a knife and told to curse President-elect Donald Trump.

“Say, ‘F--- Donald Trump,’” someone is heard saying.

“F--- Donald Trump,” the victim says.

‘Battered’ Victim Escapes, Is Located by Police

After nearly six hours of being tormented by his captors Tuesday, the victim managed to free himself and escape after the suspects left the apartment to confront a neighbor on a lower floor who had complained about the noise they were making, according to Duffin.

The neighbor complained to the Covingtons and threatened to call the police if the noise didn’t stop. The sisters were angry about being asked to quiet down, so they left the apartment and went downstairs to kick in the neighbor’s door, according to Duffin. That provided the alleged victim with an opportunity to flee the building, Duffin said.

Chicago police officers were dispatched on Tuesday to respond to a damaged property call at the Covingtons’ apartment building, stemming from the sisters’ kicking the neighbor’s door. That’s when Officer Michael Donnelly spotted the victim on a street nearby, he told reporters at Thursday’s news conference.

The officer said the victim was wearing jean shorts, sandals and an inside-out and backward tank top, despite the frigid temperatures. The man was “bloody” and “battered” when Donnelly approached, he said.

He said he called an ambulance and left the victim with two other officers, then went to investigate at the Covingtons’ building. The man was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment, police said.

Suspects Arrested, Charged in ‘Brutal Act’

While investigating at the Covingtons’ apartment, Chicago police said they observed “signs of a struggle and damage to the property and were able to link this evidence to the disoriented male.”

Meanwhile, as Streamwood police officers were investigating the victim’s disappearance, the parents “began receiving text messages from persons claiming to be holding him captive,” the Streamwood Police Department said in a statement. Soon after that, Streamwood police discovered the video on Facebook, and they were informed by the Chicago Police Department that the victim had been located.

The four suspects were arrested Wednesday and charged the next day in connection with what a police official called a “brutal act.” In video statements to investigators, the suspects admitted to beating and kicking the victim and making him drink toilet water, police said.

Cook County Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil denied public defenders’ request for bond in the suspects’ court appearance Friday.

Obama Addresses ‘Horrific’ Attack

In an interview on Thursday with ABC’s Chicago station, WLS, President Obama called the alleged incident “horrific” and “terrible.”

Obama noted that technology can play a useful role in exposing racism and hatred that still exists in the country.

“Part of what technology allows us to see now is the terrible toll that racism and discrimination and hate takes on families and communities. But that’s part of how we learn and how we get better,” he told WLS. “We don’t benefit from pretending that racism doesn’t exist and hate doesn’t exist. We don’t benefit from not talking about it. The fact that these things are being surfaced means we can solve them.”

Victim and Family Trying to Heal

The victim’s family held a news conference Thursday in Crystal Lake, Illinois. “He’s doing well — as well as he could be at this time,” the victim’s brother-in-law, David Boyd, said. “We’re so grateful for all the prayers and efforts that led to the safe return of our brother.

Boyd confirmed that the family is “fully aware of the charges being brought against the offenders.” He said that family members have been “overwhelmed and surprised” by the outpouring of support from the public and that they are “trying to stick together” as they “cope and heal.”

“We’re happy everyone is concerned,” he told reporters. “This should never happen.”

The suspects, scheduled to appear in court Friday afternoon, posted a video on Facebook that allegedly shows them assaulting the man. The video was later removed by the social media company, which said it does ""not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook.""

The victim was found outdoors in the frigid temperatures Tuesday, confused and wearing sandals, shorts and an inside-out tank top, Chicago police officer Michael Donnelly said on Thursday. He described the victim as ""bloody"" and ""battered.""

Around the same time, the suspects were taken into custody for another incident near the address where the victim was found, police said, and they were able to link ""signs of a struggle and damage to the property and were able to link this evidence to the disoriented male.""

At one point, the victim was threatened with a knife and was told to curse President-elect Donald Trump.

""Say, 'F--- Donald Trump,'"" someone is heard saying.

""F--- Donald Trump,"" the victim says.

Detectives later determined that the victim was listed as a missing endangered person from a nearby suburb, Duffin said.

According to a press release issued by the Streamwood Police Department, the victim's parents reported his disappearance late Monday night, telling police they had not heard from their son since Saturday, when they dropped him off at a McDonald's restaurant.

As officers were investigating, the victim's parents ""began receiving text messages from persons claiming to be holding him captive,"" the Streamwood Police Department stated in the press release. Soon after that, Streamwood police discovered the video on Facebook, and they were told by the Chicago Police Department that the victim had been located.

Police believe the victim is an acquaintance of one of the suspects, who have given video statements, according to Duffin.

A Facebook spokesperson said the video was taken down because the company does ""not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook.""

“We do not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook and have removed the original video for this reason,"" the spokesperson said in a statement obtained by ABC News today. ""In many instances, though, when people share this type of content, they are doing so to condemn violence or raise awareness about it. In that case, the video would be allowed.""

Four people were arrested in Chicago on Wednesday in connection with the video, which allegedly shows the individuals committing a ""brutal act"" toward a man ""with mental health challenges,"" Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a press conference following the arrests.

The suspects -- two men and two women -- allegedly assaulted the victim and then broadcast it ""for the entire world to see,"" Johnson said.

""It’s sickening,"" Johnson said of the video. ""It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat someone like that.""

While on patrol on Chicago's West Side on Tuesday, police officers encountered the victim, who ""didn't seem right"" and was in ""in distress,"" Chicago Police Department Capt. Steven Sesso said at the press conference. The victim was then transported to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Around the same time, the suspects were taken into custody for another incident near the address where the victim was found, police said. A Chicago Police press release explained that the officers ""responded to a battery at a residence ... where they discovered signs of a struggle and damage to the property and were able to link this evidence to the disoriented male.""

Police determined that the individuals arrested were responsible for the ""injury and maltreatment"" of the victim, Sesso said.

Officials later became aware of a social media video depicting a battery of an adult male which is believed to be the same individual, police said.

The video of the violent assault shows a white man with his mouth taped shut as his captors repeatedly torture him. Someone is heard yelling, ""F---- white people.""

At one point, the victim was threatened with a knife and told to curse President-elect Donald Trump.

""Say f--- Donald Trump,"" someone is heard saying.

Soon after, Streamwood police discovered the video on Facebook and they were informed by the Chicago Police Department that the victim had been located.

Police believe the victim is an acquaintance of one of the suspects. According to Duffin, the suspects stole a van from the suburbs and drove to Chicago. The victim voluntarily went with them, Duffin said, and he may have been held captive for 24 to 48 hours.

Police believe the suspects eventually unbound the victim and let him go. He was later released from the hospital but has been ""traumatized"" by the incident, Duffin said.

The suspects, three of whom are Chicago residents, are expected to be charged in the next 24 hours, Duffin said at the press conference Wednesday. Police will determine whether kidnapping or hate crime charges will be given to the suspects, whom he described as ""young adults."" They have all given video statements.

Police do not believe any additional suspects were involved in the incident. The investigation is ongoing.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/sentencing-phase-begins-dylann-roof-federal-death-penalty/story?id=44544348,"Dylann Roof, addressing the jurors who will decide whether or not he will be sentenced to death, said in an opening statement today, ""there's nothing wrong with me psychologically.""

Roof, who is representing himself for the sentencing phase of his federal trial, spoke for less than five minutes, telling the jury, ""Other than I trust people I shouldn't ... there's nothing wrong with me psychologically,"" ABC affiliate WCIV reported.

When Roof began his statement, one woman spoke out and walked out of the courtroom. Two other women walked out shortly after.

Roof said he's acting as his own lawyer because he doesn't want mental health evidence to be presented at his sentencing. Roof asked the jurors to ""forget"" anything his defense attorneys may have told them about his mental health during the guilt phase of the trial. Last month, the jury found Roof guilty of shooting and killing nine parishioners at a Charleston, South Carolina, church, in June 2015.

The government is asking the jury to sentence Roof to death. In the government's opening statement today, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathan Williams said the government plans to break down Roof's motive, his lack of remorse and the impact his crime had on the victims.

Sketch by Robert Maniscalco/Reuters

Williams said Roof targeted his victims because of the color of their skin and said he preyed upon their vulnerability.

Williams presented a letter Roof penned six weeks after his arrest, in which he wrote in part, ""I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed.""

Survivors and victims' families packed the courtroom today, and many people sobbed during the government's opening statement. The husband of survivor Felicia Sanders stood up during the government's statement to move to another row to comfort someone.

Roof's grandparents, including his grandfather, who is a longtime attorney, were the only family in the courtroom this morning on Roof's behalf. They sat in silence and showed no emotion.

The first witness called by the government today was Jennifer Pinckney, wife of slain pastor and South Carolina State Sen. Clementa Pinckney.

Jennifer Pinckney told the jury her husband was a loving, devoted and involved father to their two young daughters, ages 12 and 7. His nickname for one of his daughters was ""grasshopper.""

Jennifer Pinckney said the family loved going to the movies and Clementa Pinckney would often surprise her with gifts.

Sketch by Robert Maniscalco/Reuters

She said he was a great catch and described him as the person that every mom would want her daughter to meet.

Jennifer Pinckney and her youngest daughter were at the church the night of the shooting; they were in an office while her husband was at the Bible study where the shooting took place. Today she recounted to the jury how she and her young daughter hid under a desk as gunshots rang out; she said they put their hands over each other's mouth.

Jennifer Pinckney testified that she heard Roof say he was not crazy and had to do this. She said Roof tried to open the door to where she was, but it was locked.

Her emotional 911 call was also played in court; in the call, she told the dispatcher she could hear people moaning.

RICHARD ELLIS/EPA

She said the hardest thing she ever had to do was tell her 6-year-old and 12-year-old that their father had been killed.

She told the jury she and her daughter could have easily been victims, but she thinks her life was spared so she could continue her husband's legacy.

Clementa Pinckney's colleague South Carolina State Sen. Gerald Malloy said on the stand that Clementa Pinckney was a considerate, compassionate and eloquent man who was devoted to public service. A voicemail was played in court that Clementa Pinckney left a woman with cancer; in the voicemail, Clementa Pinckney said she's in his prayers and that he's praying for her recovery.

Malloy testified that he's not surprised that Clementa Pinckney invited Roof into the Bible study because he had an open-door policy for people from all walks of life.

Rev. Anthony Thompson, victim Myra Thompson's husband, also took the stand today, describing his late wife's devotion to teaching and counseling.

Myra Thompson was a mother and grandmother, and the couple was planning to move to Charlotte, North Carolina, to be closer to their grandchildren.

After the shooting, it was church survivors Sanders and Polly Sheppard who told him his wife was dead, according to WCIV.

""I just lost it. For the first time I lost control,"" Thompson, in tears, told the jury, according to WCIV. ""She was everything I had and everything I ever wanted and my life will never be the same.""

The government is expected to call more than 30 witnesses, mostly survivors and victims' family members, to testify. Survivors Sheppard and Sanders, who were called to the stand during the first phase of the trial, are expected to testify again.

Roof told U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel last week he has ""no plans whatsoever to call witnesses"" during the sentencing phase.

During the sentencing phase, Roof cannot approach the jury, the witness stand or the bench, Gergel wrote in an order. Roof's standby counsel will sit in the first two seats at the defendant's counsel table closest to the center aisle and Roof will sit in the third seat, Gergel ordered.

Roof, who is white, was convicted last month of shooting and killing nine parishioners at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church on June 17, 2015. The 33 federal counts against Roof included hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death.

Roof entered the church armed and ""with the intent of killing African-Americans engaged in the exercise of their religious beliefs,"" according to the federal indictment against him. The parishioners welcomed Roof into their Bible study group, according to the indictment, after which Roof drew his pistol and opened fire.

Defense attorney David Bruck told the court last month, ""He did it ... You're probably wondering, so what we are doing here? Why does there need to be a trial? ... The practical reason is that the government has asked for the death penalty after conviction, and because of that, we have a procedure to go through.”

""Our society does not order the death penalty if there are reasons to choose life,"" Bruck added. ""You're going to want to understand who this person was and why on earth he would want to cause so much grief.""

Roof appeared in court Monday at a sealed competency hearing, wearing a prison jumpsuit with his hands and feet shackled. The hearing was sealed, Gergel said, because of the risk of jurors’ being exposed to new information through the press or social media. Gergel said he would release information from Monday's hearing in 10 days, after Roof is sentenced.

""This is an incredibly sensitive moment in this trial,"" Gergel said.

After Monday's “day-long” competency hearing, according to a court filing, Roof was found to still be competent to stand trial and to self-represent. Roof asked that the sentencing phase be delayed by one day, and begin Wednesday instead of Tuesday; his request was granted by the court.

""The way our community is treated in the media is unfortunately very monolithic,"" MPAC spokeswoman Rabiah Ahmed told ABC News today. ""When one person acts out -- whether it's making a false report or some other type of bad behavior -- it's often looked upon as if the whole community is responsible for it, and it's saddening.""

One recent false report was made in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where a woman fabricated a hate crime incident in November, city police announced on Wednesday.

The woman, whom police are not naming at this time, alleged at the time that a man approached her near the University of Michigan campus and threatened to set her on fire if she did not remove her hijab, according to a spokesman for the Ann Arbor Police Department.

After poring over multiple surveillance videos, and after interviewing multiple witnesses, investigators determined ""the incident in question did not occur,"" the police department spokesman told ABC News today. He added that the results of the investigation have been forwarded to the county's prosecutor's office, which will determine whether the woman will face charges.

In a separate case in New York City, police arrested an 18-year-old woman named Yasmin Seweid on charges of filing a false report and obstructing governmental administration, according to ABC's New York station WABC.

The NYPD said last week that Seweid falsely claimed that three men taunted her aboard a subway train on Dec. 1, yelling ""Donald Trump"" and calling her a ""terrorist."" The NYPD added that Seweid also falsely claimed that the men tried to take off her hijab and told her to ""Get that f------ thing off your head!""

Seweid may have made up the story to get attention because of family issues at home, according to the NYPD.

Seweid's attorney, Benjamin Jon West, could not immediately be reached for comment on the case, nor the Manhattan Criminal Court for additional information, including if Seweid has entered a plea to the charges.

Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), told ABC News today that he believes the false reports are ""statistically inevitable when you have such a large pool of reports.""

""I think these cases are a function of the tremendous spike in the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes in recent weeks, particularly after the November election,"" Hooper said. ""As with any type of reporting, a certain small percentage of them are going to turn out to be false.""

Hooper added that he was concerned about how such reports are used against the Muslim-American community at large, which has been hurting and experiencing tremendous levels of fear, especially after the presidential election.

""These false reports unfortunately give ammunition to the industry of Islamophobes who promote the demonization and dehumanization of Islamic Muslims,"" he said. ""But one or two false reports should not take away from the credibility of dozens of other real ones.""

Hooper also told ABC News that the Muslim community ""is under great psychological stress and tension right now, and that that in itself can cause mental health issues that lead to these types of incidents.""

Ahmed echoed Hooper, saying that ""we have youth going through a variety of issues"" and ""the community isn't immune to all the societal pressures out there that could lead someone to not tell the truth, exaggerate or report a false crime.""

""We, as a community, need to do our best to try and make sure our people are supported and that we're verifying claims before they're shared,"" she said. ""But at the same time, we really are facing an increase in anti-Muslim sentiment and hate crimes, and we need to shed a light on these issues and challenges.""",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/US/accused-church-shooter-dylann-roof-showed-tremendous-hatred/story?id=44208371,"Dylann Roof showed ""tremendous cowardice"" and ""tremendous hatred"" when he gunned down nine helpless worshippers at a Charleston, South Carolina, church last year, the prosecution said Thursday in its closing arguments in Roof's federal death penalty trial.

Roof, 22, who is white, is accused of fatally shooting nine black parishioners during a Bible study at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church on June 17, 2015. He allegedly entered the church armed and ""with the intent of killing African-Americans engaged in the exercise of their religious beliefs,"" according to the federal indictment against him.

The Prosecution

Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathan Williams began the prosecution's closing arguments by describing church as a sanctuary, ""a place of safety, fellowship and welcoming."" Williams said hatred doesn't have a place in such a venue.

Nonetheless, Roof felt hatred and targeted the church, Williams said. ""It was a cold and calculated hatred that had been developing for months ... that had been seeking out the most vulnerable people to target,"" Williams said, according to local ABC affiliate WCIV. ""He sat there with them, and he waited until they were at their most vulnerable.""

Williams continued, ""When they stood to pray, when they had their eyes closed ... in those actions we see exactly who this defendant is ... a man whose actions show him to be a man of tremendous cowardice, shooting them when their eyes were closed, shooting them when they were on the ground.""

Williams said that Roof believes black people are a problem for America and that he thinks society should go back to a time when slavery was allowed, ""one of the most dismal and shameful in this country's history,"" WCIV reported.

""[He believes] the color of a person's skin makes them less than human,"" said Williams.

Williams pointed to Roof's manifesto, in which he said Roof identified himself as the one who had to act. ""We've seen in these writings a racist retribution,"" said Williams. ""[Roof] literally wants there to be a race war.""

Next, Williams spoke about the steps Roof took to prepare for his deadly rampage. Roof worked to find ""the most vulnerable people to attack,"" Williams said, saying Roof made several trips to Charleston, scouting the church. Roof considered a black festival but decided against it because of its security, Williams said. So instead he turned to a church, Williams said, and began stockpiling ammunition.

On June 17, Roof drove to the church, taking a route he had practiced, Williams said. The church he chose, Emanuel AME, was at the top of a list of possible targets, Williams said.

""That tells you the depth, the vastness of his hatred,"" Williams said.

He then asked how someone could shoot a person on the ground. ""The answer, in part, is because he thinks they're less than human,"" Williams said, WCIV reported.

The worst part of Roof's hatred, Williams said, is that he carried out his attack in a church. Roof drove for 90 minutes to Charleston, then sat outside Emanuel AME for 28 minutes before going inside, Williams said. Roof was ""planning and preparing for what he was about to do,"" Williams said. Then Roof loaded his gun and went inside, Williams said.

For 40 minutes, Roof sat with his victims, ""waiting for the chance to kill them"" before opening fire, Williams said. ""For every person he killed, he must be held accountable.""

Williams then pointed out that each victim was shot repeatedly. He commended the bravery of those who faced Roof as he fired, including victim Tywanza Sanders, who tried to draw Roof's attention away from the other people in the church, Williams said.

During his video ""confession,"" Roof laughed over and over, Williams said.

""This defendant's hatred was overwhelming,"" Williams said.

But Roof's nine victims triumphed over his hatred, Williams continued. ""[Roof] thought it would spread his message of hate, but that message was stopped by their goodness ... He chose the wrong good people.""

He added, ""That church was a sanctuary because these good people created a sanctuary ... And this defendant's hatred has no place in that sanctuary.""

Williams concluded by asking the jury to find Roof guilty of every count.

The Defense

Attorney David Bruck spoke next, saying in the defense's closing arguments that the answer is simple when it comes to the issue of what happened and who did it.

He asked the jury to consider the why of this case and understand what was going on in Roof's head.

Bruck called Roof a boy with an ""obsession"" and described the repeated trips to Charleston as ""ritualistic.""

""He had nowhere to go,"" said Bruck. ""Just a car full of dirty stuff, like he'd been living there.""

Bruck pointed to the fact that Roof told the FBI that he had saved his last bullets for himself. Bruck said that this indicates Roof wasn't going to kill other people; instead, he had decided to kill himself, Bruck said.

He appeared to have no friends, Bruck said. ""He didn't get this from anyone else that he knew,"" Bruck said.

Bruck described Roof as a lonely dropout reading things online in his room. Bruck brought up the Trayvon Martin case, which Roof cited in his manifesto as what piqued his interest.

Bruck said Roof proceeded to find an explanation for every bad thing that had happened and placed the blame at the feet of black people.

""He is simply regurgitating,"" Bruck said, ""bits and pieces of stuff that he has downloaded into his brain from the internet.""

Bruck said Roof never adequately explained why he carried out his deadly rampage. ""He repeats 10 times in confession, 'I had to do it,'"" he said.

Bruck pointed to Roof's warped perception of reality, saying Roof appeared shocked to learn in his interview with the FBI he had killed nine people. ""There is something wrong with his perception,"" Bruck said.

Bruck noted various peculiarities in Roof's behavior, such as having hundreds of pictures of his cat.

He then asked the jury to consider the senselessness of the crime and how illogical it was. He told the jury to question whether there's more to the story.

Bruck concluded by asking the jury to approach the case with the same grace that survivor Polly Sheppard displayed when she took the stand.

Government Response

In response, prosecutor Stephen Curran said that ""none of what Mr. Bruck just told you comes close to undermining what that man [Roof] did.""

Curran said Roof was 21 when he carried out the attack, old enough to understand what he did.

Curran continued, ""He did act alone. No one forced him do this. No one made him do it. His choices, his decisions, his actions.""

Curran told the jury to look at the ""confession"" video, saying what's seen is not someone who's ""delusional.""

The answers to why Roof carried out this attack are in the evidence, Curran said. The reason is racism, he said.

""There are still people who will kill, simply because of the color of someone's skin,"" Curran said.

For Roof, race wasn't a complicated issue, said Curran. Roof believed African-Americans are lesser people, said Curran. He lamented that white people are no longer superior, Curran said.

""Don't be distracted by the defense counsel's argument,"" Curran said. ""It's not that complicated. He told us why.""

With that, closing arguments concluded.

The jury was read the charges and was sent to deliberate just after 1 p.m.

The 33 federal counts against Roof include hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death. If convicted, Roof faces the death penalty.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/dylann-roof-federal-trial-key-points-governments-case/story?id=44162401,"The government has laid out its death penalty case against Dylann Roof, the 22-year-old accused of killing nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.

Roof, who is white, is accused of shooting and killing nine black parishioners at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church on June 17, 2015. Roof allegedly entered the church armed and ""with the intent of killing African-Americans engaged in the exercise of their religious beliefs,"" according to the federal indictment against him. The parishioners welcomed Roof into their Bible study group, according to the indictment, after which Roof allegedly drew his pistol and opened fire.

The 33 federal counts against Roof include hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death. If convicted, Roof faces the death penalty. Roof has pleaded not guilty.

Here are some of the key points from the government's case ahead of Thursday's closing arguments.

Survivor Felicia Sanders

Felicia Sanders, a survivor of the shooting, was the government's first witness. When Roof opened fire that June night, Sanders said she clutched her granddaughter tight and told her to play dead.

""I could feel the warm blood flowing on each side of me,"" she said.

""I was just waiting on my turn,"" she added. ""Even if I got shot, I just didn't want my granddaughter to get shot.""

Amid the chaos and the bloodshed, her youngest son, Tywanza Sanders, stood up and confronted the assailant: ""Why are you doing this?"" he asked, according to Felicia Sanders' testimony.

""And he told our son, 'I have to do this because y'all raping our women and taking over the world,'"" Felicia Sanders said. ""And that's when [the gunman] put about five bullets in my son.""

Felicia Sanders then tearfully recalled watching her son die.

""We watched him take his last breath,"" she said. ""I watched my son come into this world, and I watched my son leave this world.""

Gruesome Photos

Investigators showed pictures from the gruesome scene at the basement hall where the shooting happened. The images showed bodies with numbers labeling what investigators believe was the order in which they were shot. The images also showed streams of blood. Many of the victims were under the rickety tables. Some Bibles were still on the tables.

Roof's Video 'Confession'

In a video interview of Roof conducted by an FBI agent shortly after he was captured and played in court, Roof laughed as he admitted to the shooting.

He also said he used a .45-caliber Glock to do it, according to the video. ""I didn't say anything to them before I pulled it out, not even one word,"" Roof says of the gun in the video. ""I mean, they reacted after I shot them.""

Asked in the video when he decided to do the shooting, Roof say, ""I can't tell you.""

Roof's voice was mostly monotone during the interview, though it was often punctuated by laughter.

""I am guilty,"" he says, laughing.

Roof said he did not expect to survive the shooting because he expected police to respond to the church and shoot him. Once he escaped, he said he spontaneously decided to go to Charlotte, North Carolina, because he didn't want to go home to Columbia.

After an agent tells him he killed nine people and asks how he feels, Roof responds in the video in a monotone voice, ""It makes me feel bad.""

Roof's Journal of Racist Language

Testimony also addressed letters Roof wrote to his parents and a journal he kept with racist entries -- all found in his car after he was apprehended.

In a note to his mother, Roof apologized and said he loved her, and he wrote, ""Childish as it sounds I wish I was in your arms.""

In the journal, Roof degrades African Americans and Jews, and a state law enforcement agent on the witness stand read the racist entries aloud. Some jurors leaned on their hands as they read the journal entries on monitors and appeared shocked.

Families of the victims were quiet, some wrapped in colorful blankets to stay warm in the cold courtroom.

Roof wrote that he was not raised in a racist place. He also wrote that after reading a Wikipedia entry about the Trayvon Martin case, it was obvious to him that George Zimmerman, the man who fatally shot Martin, was in the right, and he was never the same again.

Roof also wrote that one of his only regrets is that he was never able to fall in love.

Roof's Note Listing Churches

Roof had a handwritten note in his car with the names of several churches on it, according to testimony from a former South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) agent who processed Roof's car after the shooting.

Besides the note listing churches, notable items in Roof's car included a Confederate flag, a burned American flag, a gun, an empty box of ammunition and a laser attachment for a gun that helps with accuracy.

Survivor Polly Sheppard

Polly Sheppard was the government's final witness. One of the deadly rampage's three survivors, Sheppard said she initially thought the gunshots were an electrical problem. But then Felicia Sanders screamed that it was a gun, Sheppard said. Sheppard said she saw Roof shoot Rev. Daniel Simmons, then she ducked under a table.

She told the court that she listened to the gunshots ring out as she hid. She said she saw the casings bounce and roll across the ground, and watched as Roof's boots came closer and closer. When Roof got to the tables, he told her to shut up as she was praying out loud, she said.

Then she said Roof asked her if she was shot. She told him no, she said, and he replied that he wouldn't shoot her. ""I’m going to leave you alive to tell the story,"" Sheppard said Roof told her.

Sheppard's emotional 911 call was also played in court.

The Defense

Defense attorney David Bruck said in opening statements that Roof committed the crime but the trial involves understanding ""who this person was and why on earth he would want to cause so much grief.""

""He did it,"" Bruck said of Roof. ""... You're probably wondering, so what we are doing here? Why does there need to be a trial? ... The practical reason is that the government has asked for the death penalty after conviction, and because of that, we have a procedure to go through.""

Bruck said the jury must ""go deeper than the surface with this awful crime.""

""Among the elements of the crime are racial hatred. In considering that issue, ask yourself where this extraordinary degree of racial feeling came from. ... How much sense does this crime make? Does it make any sense at all? And if not, what does that tell you?"" he said.

After the prosecution rested its case, Roof told the judge that he did not want to testify, and the defense called zero witnesses before it, too, rested.

Closing arguments are slated for Thursday, then the jury will begin deliberations.

Roof also faces a state trial, set for early next year, in which he may also face the death penalty.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/charleston-church-shooting-survivor-prayed-dylann-roof-gunned/story?id=44185820,"The federal trial for Dylann Roof, the 22-year-old accused of killing nine people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church, continued today with one of the three survivors of the deadly rampage taking the stand.

Polly Sheppard, 72, told the court of how Roof opened fire on her and her fellow parishioners as they stood to pray at the end of Bible study. Sheppard's emotional 911 call was also played in court.

Roof, who is white, is accused of fatally shooting nine black parishioners during a Bible study at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church on June 17, 2015. Roof allegedly entered the church armed and ""with the intent of killing African-Americans engaged in the exercise of their religious beliefs,"" according to the federal indictment against him.

Roof was captured in North Carolina the day after the shooting.

Sheppard told the court that she chose to attend Emanuel because her husband was a third-generation member there. She said she was a member of the trustee board together with victim Myra Thompson.

On June 17, 2015, Sheppard said she went to the quarterly conference meeting at the church at 6 p.m. She told the court she planned to leave after the meeting, but ended up staying for Bible study that day because Thompson had asked her to.

Sheppard spoke fondly of the victims on the stand. ""She sang like an angel,"" she said of Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor. She told the court that Sharonda Coleman-Singleton was working on a Ph.D. at the time of her death. ""She could preach real well,"" Sheppard said. Cynthia Hurd loved to read and ""was just a lovely person,"" while Susie Jackson sang in the choir and would do anything for you, said Sheppard.

That fateful day, Sheppard said she sat in the back of the room for Bible study, hoping to sneak out. When asked why she didn't, Sheppard said of Thompson, ""She kept watching me.""

Roof joined them, Sheppard told the court. Sheppard said that Rev. Clementa Pinckney asked Roof to sit beside him and gave him the lesson and Bible.

As Bible study ended, Sheppard said they planned to finish with a prayer and the benediction. They did not get to the benediction because Roof opened fire as they began praying, she said.

At first, she told the court, Sheppard thought it was an electrical problem. But then Felicia Sanders, one of the other survivors, screamed that it was a gun, she said. Sheppard said she saw Roof shoot Rev. Daniel Simmons, then she ducked under a table.

She told the court that she listened to the gunshots ring out as she hid. She said she saw the casings bounce and roll across the ground, and watched as Roof's boots came closer and closer. When Roof got to the tables, he told her to shut up as she was praying out loud, she said.

Then she said Roof asked her if she was shot. She told him no, she said, and he replied that he wouldn't shoot her. ""I’m going to leave you alive to tell the story,"" Sheppard said Roof told her.

Sheppard said she saw victim Tywanza Sanders, Felicia Sanders' son, sit up and try to draw attention away from the living. He told Roof that none of them meant him any harm, but Roof responded that he had to kill them, Sheppard said. He then shot and killed Tywanza Sanders right at Sheppard's feet, she said.

After killing Tywanza Sanders, the gun clicked twice, which made Sheppard think it was empty, she said.

""My first thought was to call somebody,"" Sheppard said. She found Ethel Lance's phone covered in blood on the floor next to her and called 911, she said.

The call was played in court. In it, Sheppard can be heard sobbing and begging for help. ""He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. Please!"" she tells the dispatcher. In the background, moaning can be heard.

""There’s so many people dead,"" Sheppard says in the call. The dispatcher then tells her to be quiet.

The defense declined to cross-examine Sheppard.

Earlier, the prosecution called Erin Presnell, the head forensic pathologist at the Medical University of South Carolina, who performed all nine autopsies on the victims. Presnell testified that each victim was shot multiple times.

The prosecution rested its case once Sheppard was done speaking.

Roof told the judge that he did not want to testify, and the defense called zero witnesses before it, too, rested.

Former South Carolina Law Enforcement Division agent Brittany Burke, who processed Roof's car after the shooting, was on the stand this morning, recounting items found in the car after the then-21-year-old was captured.

Besides the note listing churches, notable items in Roof's car included a Confederate flag, a burned American flag, a gun, an empty box of ammunition and a laser attachment for a gun that helps with accuracy.

Personal items were also in the car like a GPS, deodorant and cigarettes, Burke said.

Roof was captured in North Carolina the day after the shooting.

The federal courtroom was packed today on the victims' side. Roof appeared in court wearing a green sweater and grey pants.

A prosecution witness, Ronald Thrailkill, who sold the Glock used in the attack to Roof, also testified today.

Roof purchased the Glock in April -- two months before the shooting, Thrailkill said. Surveillance video was played in court showing Roof coming into the gun store and looking around. Video also shows Roof coming back to the store to buy the gun three business days later.

Roof filled out paperwork, including background information that asked about drugs and mental health, Thrailkill testified. If the perspective buyer answers ""yes"" to any of those questions, the sale is canceled, he said.

Any licensed firearm dealer has access to the national instant criminal check (NICS), which can allow, deny or delay a purchase within three business days, he said. Thrailkill testified that he can sell a gun if there's no response from the NICS system after three business days.

During cross-examination, Thrailkill testified that when NICS didn't respond to him in three days, he decided to go ahead with the sale to Roof.

Thrailkill testified that on June 29, 2015 -- after the church shooting -- he received communication from NICS that the sale was to be denied. Roof, then in custody, had at that point admitted to authorities that he used narcotics.

FBI agent Tracy Sicks also testified today about a website believed to belong to Roof that included a manifesto with racist language, according to ABC affiliate WCIV.

On Friday, a video interview of Roof conducted by law enforcement was played in court, in which Roof laughed as he admitted to the shooting.

He also said he used a Glock 45 to do it, according to the video. ""I didn't say anything to them before I pulled it out, not even one word,"" Roof said of the gun in the video. ""I mean they reacted after I shot them.""

During a break from testimony, Roof, who wore a grey sweater and khakis, left the courtroom with a smile and his eyes half-closed after sitting through some of the video. None of his family was in court this morning as the beginning of the video was played.

More of today's testimony below is according to ABC affiliate WCIV, which also reported on the video-taped interview played in court.

During the interview, Roof ""was sitting there eating a hamburger. He was not upset, crying, or showing any emotions,"" Stansbury said, adding that Roof was calm and showed no remorse.

In the video interview, Stansbury asked Roof why he had to do it, and Roof told him he believed that someone had to do something about what he said were crimes committed by blacks against white people.

""I don't like what black people do,"" Roof says in the video, but notes that no black person was ever violent to him or his family to prompt the attack.

Roof said no one else was brave enough to do anything, referencing the KKK and skinheads.

He said he chose Charleston because ""it's a nice historic city"" and ""at one time it had the highest ratio of black people to white people in the whole country.""

""I just like Charleston,"" he said, adding, ""I just knew there was a historic African Methodist church.""

Roof said he knew the church ""would be a place where there would be, you know, at least a swarm of black people in one area. I thought about a black festival or something like that but they have security.""

""I wasn't going to go to another church because there could be white people there,"" he said.

Roof said in the video he tries not to think about the people he killed being innocent.

""I'm not in the position by myself to go to, like, a black neighborhood or something like that, and shoot up a drug dealer,"" Roof said.

Roof said he drank ""a little alcohol"" while sitting in his car before going in the church.

He said he thinks there were ""two people"" in the church ""I didn't shoot at all."" He said during the shooting ""there were pauses in between and I was thinking about what I should do."" Roof said no one in the church charged him to try and stop him.

When Roof left the church, he said he was shocked that no one was outside. ""I peeked out the door because I thought there would be someone there waiting to shoot me,"" he said.

Roof said in the video he considers himself a white nationalist and that he thinks the white race should be the dominant race.

""I didn't think I would start a race war or anything like that. A race war would be pretty terrible,"" Roof said, adding that he would want to reinstate segregation or ""something like that,"" saying segregation wasn't bad.

Asked how long he had thought this, Roof said, ""The first thing that woke me up would be the Trayvon Martin case,"" referring to the 2012 shooting death of the unarmed black teen in Florida.

He said after reading a Wikipedia page about Trayvon Martin, ""for some reason I typed in 'black on white crime.' And ever since then.""

Roof said he never ""talked about race around other people,"" including family members.

During the interview, agents showed Roof several photos they obtained from his father's home, including one of the number ""1488"" scratched in the sand.

Roof tells the agents ""88 stands for Heil Hitler. ... I support Hitler.""

He says he drew in the sand on Sullivan's Island, a beach town just outside of Charleston.

When agents ask if he has any remorse, Roof replies, ""I think it's too soon.""

Asked if he has regrets, Roof says, ""A little bit. ... I don't know how many people are killed or anything.""

When an agent asks what the purpose of the nine deaths was, Roof replies, ""I don't know.""

http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/victor-cruz-speaks-racist-graffiti-found-teammates-home/story?id=44073016,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz said Thursday that he views the racist graffiti drawn during a break-in of the home of teammate Nikita Whitlock as a reflection of the current state of the country.?

Police in Moonachie, New Jersey, are investigating the Tuesday night robbery, during which burglars drew a swastika and ""KKK,"" as well as the word ""Trump,"" on walls inside Whitlock's home.?

The incident is being investigated as a hate crime,?Moonachie police Sgt. Richard Behrens told The Record.?

On Thursday, Cruz spoke out against what happened.?

""I think it's definitely a direct reflection of how this country is being run and how this country is reacting maybe to some of the decisions and some of the ways that this country is being run and the things that are being said by the people at [the] helm of this country and at the helm of our day-to-day lives,"" the veteran Giants receiver said.

""From social media all the way up to the White House, these are things that are being spoken of and talked about on a daily basis, the good and the bad -- more so the bad at this point right now because that's all we have to work with. It's just an unfortunate situation that we're going through right now.""

Cruz thinks Tuesday's incident at Whitlock's home reflects the mindset of people who support President-elect Donald Trump.

""Absolutely,"" Cruz said. ""I think there's a specific mindset that comes with supporting a guy like Donald Trump and supporting what he stands for, and there's a certain type of person that comes with that. I'm not sure that person is always a positive-minded person, if you know what I mean. You've just got to be careful.

""As [a] minority, you have to be careful, as a person of influence you have to be careful and you've just got to make sure your family is safe and give them the knowledge that they need to stay safe in this world.""

Cruz doesn't think all Trump supporters fit into that category; he said some likely just wanted change while others wanted a businessman in charge of the country.

After the presidential election, Cruz made it known that he wasn't a Trump fan. The former Pro Bowl receiver made that even clearer Thursday.

""You can't think of anything that that person that follows Donald Trump -- that they're going to do something positive,"" Cruz said. ""And for someone to vandalize someone's house and write Trump's name or whatever they wrote on the walls, it's just proving that exact fact that I'm saying -- that people that may follow him aren't necessarily the most positive people in our community.""

Cruz seemed unfazed by potential backlash from his politically based comments.

""That's fine with me,"" he said. ""I'm comfortable with that. I'm comfortable with people's reactions to that. That's my opinion, that's my mindset, that's the way I think, so I'm not upset at anybody else that thinks otherwise.""

For Cruz, a native of Paterson, New Jersey, which is about 10 miles northwest of Moonachie, the incident at Whitlock's house hit home.

""Absolutely. That's what is most shocking to me about this specific incident with Nikita Whitlock,"" Cruz said. ""It's just 20 minutes from where I grew up. This could have easily happened in Paterson. It could have easily happened in Clifton or Passaic or Lyndhurst even for that matter. This could have happened anywhere.

""To see something like that happen around here and to happen the way that it did -- breaking into a home, the vandalism ... Nikita has children. He's got to explain that to his children. Not just right now. Five years from now, 10 years from now when they ask, 'Hey, dad, remember when that happened?' They have to answer those questions. He has to answer those questions to his children. It's unfortunate. No one should have to go through that.""

Whitlock served a 10-game ban earlier this season for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing substances.

“We triggered the world,” Spencer told “Nightline.” “I think it’s good to trigger people a little bit. When you get triggered it means that you’re shocked, you thought something that you haven’t thought before. It means that you have an open mind and you can start to see the world differently.”

But what Spencer actually triggered on campus was the unified presence of thousands of people demonstrating their opposition to his views by attending a competing event at a the university’s football stadium.

Spencer is credited with coining the term “alt-right,” which he described as “the identity politics for white people in the 21st century.”

“I think the alt-right has gained a great deal of ground, precisely because we are provocative,” he added. “And precisely because, to use bad language, we don’t give a ---- on some level.”

Spencer, 38, came to national attention when video surfaced of him at a Washington, D.C. conference in November shouting “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory,” as some members of the crowd raised their hands in a Nazi salute.

Spencer said he yelled out “Hail Trump,” “in the spirit of irony and exuberance.” He added that he saw the president-elect as someone who “sling-shotted our movement into fame.” The moment he found out Trump won the presidency, Spencer said if felt like a kind of “miracle.”

“If someone had told me two years ago that Donald Trump would be the alt-right hero and he would be president, I would be like, ‘What ridiculous movie are you talking about like this is not real life,’ but it is real life,” Spencer said.

Trump has said he disavows and condemns the alt-right movement.

In an interview with “Nightline,” Spencer claimed he is not a white supremacist or a racist, but it is difficult to understand his incendiary rhetoric any other way.

He told Mother Jones magazine that “Hispanics and African Americans have lower average IQs than whites and are more genetically predisposed to commit crimes” -- a pseudo-science argument of white supremacists which has been widely discredited. But Spencer called it “an empirical fact.”

“When you study, say average intelligence say around the world, and you keep getting the same answer, at some point you are going to have to look towards genetics as a cause,” Spencer said.

His deeply inflammatory world view involves an all-white “ethno state” where races are segregated through peaceful “ethnic cleansing,” though he has been quoted before as saying that it could be bloody.

“I think the current paradigm we’re living under is going to lead to blood and tears,” Spencer said. “I don't know exactly what is going to happen but yes I do think that if there is going to be a major crack up… predominantly on racial lines.”

Spencer’s organization, the National Policy Institute, is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for promoting far-right, white-nationalist views.

“The term alt-right is really nothing more than a re-branding of white supremacy for the digital age,” said Southern Poverty Law Center president Richard Cohen. “I don’t think anybody should be fooled by what it is at its core and that is white supremacy.”

Spencer, who was raised in Dallas but now lives in Montana, has been banned by local businesses in his neighborhood. His own parents, he says, ""think I'm a little crazy.” Alums from his Class of 1997 at the elite prep school St. Marks he attended in Dallas started a fund for immigrants to repudiate his views. He said he has been banned from 25 European countries for his views.

“I’ve been banned from most of Europe,” he said, with a smile. “A lot of things have been strained because of my activism, yes, it’s been very difficult.”

But Texas A&M decided not to ban him, citing freedom of speech. The university did not invite Spencer to speak on Tuesday, but a room was booked on campus by a former student.

“Our leadership finds his views as expressed to date in direct conflict with our core values,” Texas A&M spokeperson Amy Smith said. “Private citizens are permitted to reserve space available to the public as we are a public university.”

Texas A&M President Michael Young said, “I believe we live in a world where differences actually makes us stronger.”

Rather than keep quiet about Spencer’s visit, the university managed to turn it into a teachable moment -- allowing Spencer’s freedom of speech, while supporting protesters' freedoms of expression as well.

Hundreds gathered outside the university’s student union hours before Spencer was scheduled to speak, holding signs and essentially drowning out Spencer's speech with chants and jeers. One yelled out, “Go home Spencer, we don’t want you.” Students wrote messages on a makeshift ""unity wall"" on the campus that included ""Aggies Against Hate,"" ""Love & Respect,"" and ""United We Stand.""

Former Texas A&M student Adam Davies was one of the protestors shouting at Spencer.

“I want people to … see through their lies and their misguidance. They are not alt-right, they are not racial realists, they are Neo-nazis,” he said. “It’s unacceptable even remotely feasible, try to make it so they can have a conversation about ethnic cleansing.”

A&M Ph.D. candidate Adam Kay, who helped organize Tuesday’s protests, said, “We're here to celebrate diversity and protest at the same time. It’s been crucial since the beginning not devolve into hate ourselves.”

In the end, the vast majority of Spencer’s audience inside his Texas A&M appearance were there in protest.

Tensions erupted during Spencer’s speech several times and the night ended with police in riot gear pushing people out of the building where he spoke.

“I see myself as mainstream,” Spencer said. “I'm trying to normalize racism… I'm trying to normalize my ideas, our ideas of the alt-right, yes. I do not want the alt-right to be a fringe movement, I want the alt-right to be a dominant movement.”

The Southern Poverty Law Center said there has been a spike in hate crimes since after the election with 867 hate crimes reported in 47 states. The organization said the first line of defense is spotlighting what they consider dangerous hate speech.

“[Spencer] is the head of the alt right … and quite frankly Mr. Trump ran a racially divisive campaign, so I think the media has an obligation to cover Richard Spencer,” said SPLC’s Richard Cohen.

In the end, the protestors who showed up at the Texas A&M Kyle Stadium -- including students, anti-hate groups and the university’s president -- sent a powerful message of tolerance and diversity to drown out what they considered was a repugnant and unwelcome din nearby on campus, with loud, boisterous chants of “Aggies United” filling the air.",abcnews.com,True

Tonight we take you to a showdown between a self-proclaimed white nationalist and hundreds of protesters. Richard Spencer, founder of the so-called alt-right movement which has gained national attention in recent months, became infamous when video went viral of his supporters hailing trump with Nazi salutes. When he accepted an invitation to speak on a college campus, the community stood against him. Reporter: Emotions bubbling over at Texas A&M. With the university becoming an ideological battleground. Last night, thousands came together to protest one man. White people are ruling right now. White people have tremendous amount of power. Reporter: Richard Spencer, the man who coined the term alt-right, who critics are now calling a suit and tie racist. Hail trump! Hail our people! Hail victory! Reporter: Last month this video of Spencer at a so-called alt-right conference exalting in trump's win. Going viral after some in attendance went as far as throwing the deeply disturbing Nazi salute, propelling him into the national spotlight. A white country, designed for ourselves and our policy boss perty. Reporter: His movement he says boosted by trump's win. You went from obscurity to notoriety. I think Donald Trump slingshoted our movement into fame. Reporter: We traveled to Texas to examine the roots of the new generation of racial extremism, meeting up with a 38-year-old just before his next event. You gave a speech, it went viral on ""The atlantic."" At the end you said, hail trump. Hail victory. You laugh. Why? Because that was said in a spirit of irony and exuberance. What is exuberant about genocide? What is fun about mass murder? I said hail trump, but I held up a glass of whiskey. There's some people that, a half dozen in the audience, who gave a Roman salute. It's not a Roman salute, you know that, it is a Nazi party salu salute. Are you trying to normalize racism? Yes, I'm trying to Normal it racism as you call it, absolutely, I'm trying to norm normalize my ideas, our ideas of the alt-right, yes. I do not want the alt-right to be a fringe movement, I want the alt-right to be a dominant movement. Reporter: He claims he's not a white supremacist or a racist but it is difficult to understand his inflammatory rhetoric in any other way. You told ""Mother Jones"" his pan ins and African-Americans have lower average iqs than whites and are more genetically predisposed to commit crimes. Yes. That is a classic tenet of white supremacy. It's empirical fact. Genetically predisposed? That is not a fact. When you study average intelligence around the world and you keep getting the same answer, at some point you're going to have to look towards genetics as a cause. What do your parents think of your ideas? They think I'm a bit crazy. They do? It's actually strained your relationship, according to you? A lot of things have been strained because of my activism, yes. It's been very difficult. Businesses in the Montana have banned you, restaurants have said you can't come? Sure. I've been banned from most of Europe. Reporter: Texas A&M denounced his views but decided not to ban him, citing free speech. He was invited by a former student, hoping to spread his incendiary views. His presence today not without considerable controversy. We don't like him! Go home Spencer, we don't want you, that's what he's saying. Right. I'm here. I think that's good. Do you feel like a pariah, though? Do you feel like a skunk at the garden party? A skunk at the garden party? No. What kinds of things were you shouting? I want people to see through their lies and misguidance. They are not alt-right. They are not racial realists. They are neo-nazis. Look, they're just like -- they're gutter punks. They're not good people. Let's be honest. Hey, could I borrow a marker? Thanks. Reporter: With our cameras rolling Spencer further defies his detractors, writing on a wall the students set up to voice messages against him. You enjoy being a provocateur? Yeah, who wasn't? Reporter: Spencer and his supporters feel emboldened by a political landscape he never dreamed of. Thank you very much. What was your reaction the moment you knew that trump won the presidency? It was a kind of miracle. If someone told me two years ago that Donald Trump would be the alt-right hero and he would be president -- I would be like, what ridiculous movie are you talking about? This is not real life. But it is real life. Reporter: Although the president-elect publicly distanced himself from the alt-right in an interview with the ""New York Times."" Alt-right. You say you coined the phrase. Yes. What does it mean to you? The identity politics for white people in the 21st century. Look. I think the alt-right has gained a great deal of ground precisely because we are provocative and precisely because -- to use bad language, we don't give a . The term alt-right is really nothing more than a rebranding of white supremacy for the digital 18 age. I don't think anybody should be fooled by what it is at its core, and that is, white supremacy. Reporter: According to the southern poverty law center there's already been a spike of hate crimes and harassment in the days after the presidential election. More than 800 reported in 47 states. They believe the first line of defense is spotlighting what they consider dangerous hate speech. Richard Spencer. He's the head of the alt-right. The godfather of the alt-right. And quite frankly, Mr. Trump ran a racially divisive campaign. I think the media has an obligation to cover Richard Spencer. No kkk! The shouting, this pretty rowdy group of protesters, a coalition of student groups and anti-hate groups who says, he has every right to say what he says, but it's their first amendment right to protest. This is us uniting together to have fun and come together. Reporter: Spencer says his ideal world is an all-white ethno-state where races are segregated, with a peaceful ethnic cleansing. Would I be allowed to live in your ethno-state? No, but you could have your own ethno-state. Very gracious of you. This would be a new type of society. A big empire for all Europeans -- How do you remove 100 million blacks, Latinos, Asians from your ethno-state? The ethno-state is an ideal. It's not going to happen tomorrow morning. You're quoted as saying it could be horribly bloody and terrible. That that's a possibility. Of course that's a possibility. I think the current paradigm that we are living under is going to lead to blood and tears, period. You're predicting a race war? Basically. I don't know exactly what's going to happen, but yes, I do think that it will be a crack-up predominantly on racial lines. Reporter: As night pfalls, several hundred have gathered for Spencer's talk. We're about ten minutes away and he has a packed house. I would expect fireworks. Across the street the university's president signs that very wall that Spencer wrote on earlier in the day. Well, I believe we live in a world where the differences actually make us stronger. Reporter: And he, along with a series of musicians, students -- Aggies united! Reporter: Literally drowning out his hateful message at the nearby football stadium. When there's fear and hate inside us, when our differences divide us, let love lead the way. I love you all. I'm referring to people like you -- Reporter: Back at Spencer's event, the vast majority of his audience indeed was there in opposition. With multiple outbursts and clashes erupting during his speech. Security had to intervien to de-escalate several volatile exchanges. At one point, police in riot gear entered the student union. But none of the hostility took Spencer off message. This is out of goddamn country. Our goddamn country. Reporter: At the football stadium, it is the soaring message of tolerance and diversity that unites the aggies and drowns out that hateful and unwelcome din next door. ???

http://abcnews.go.com/US/prosecutor-accused-charleston-church-shooter-dylann-roof-stood/story?id=44031417,"Dylann Roof, the 22-year-old accused of killing nine people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church, stood over his victims, shooting them over and over again, the prosecution argued this morning at Roof's federal trial.

The victims — including the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a church pastor and a member of the South Carolina Senate — ran for cover, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson, as each magazine was emptied and shell casings tumbled across the parish hall. Then Roof ""reloaded ... standing over victims, and he kept shooting and shooting,"" Richardson said.

After the shooting ended, Richardson said, Roof “left behind a scene that nobody can fathom. He walked out calmly, looking both ways … Expecting law enforcement to respond to his horrid attack.""

Richardson said today — as Roof appeared dressed in prison blues and whites in the packed courtroom — that the government will prove that Roof's ""attack was cold and calculated"" and was ""racist retribution for perceived offenses against the white race.""

Roof, who is white, is accused of fatally shooting nine black parishioners during a Bible study at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church on June 17, 2015. Roof, who was 21 at the time, entered the Emanuel AME Church armed and ""with the intent of killing African-Americans engaged in the exercise of their religious beliefs,"" according to the federal indictment against him. The parishioners welcomed Roof into their Bible study group, according to the indictment, after which Roof drew his pistol and opened fire.

Richardson argued that Roof prepared for the attack, stockpiling ammunition and conducting target practice. Richardson told the court Roof called the church four months before the attack and made frequent stops there to check it out. Roof ""chose that church because of the impact it had, the manner in which it would resonate across the nation,"" Richardson said.

On that night, as the Bible study came to a close, the parishioners stood to pray, Richardson told the court. ""It was at that time that defendant made clear what he had been planning for months,"" he said. ""Instead of a Bible to study, the defendant chose to bring a .45-caliber pistol.

""Still seated in a chair that Rev. Pinckney had provided for him, he pulled the .45-caliber Glock and shot Rev. Pinckney,” Richardson said. People then ran for cover, but Roof reloaded and kept shooting, Richardson said.

""As the defendant continued with his assaults, Polly Sheppard could see his boots walking closer and closer to her,"" Richardson said. Roof allegedly told her he would keep ""her alive to tell the story of what he had done,"" Richardson said.

Victim Tywanza Sanders interjected and stood up, even though he had already been shot, and allegedly told Roof that he didn't have to do this, Richardson said.

Roof allegedly responded, ""Y'all are raping our white women. Y'all are taking over the world,"" and then shot Tywanza repeatedly, Richardson said.

Richardson said in his opening statement that Roof ""wrote a manifesto that he wanted to be read around the world,"" that Roof ""claimed white superiority ... His manifesto was a call to arms. A belief that it was not too late take this country back from black Americans.""

After Roof was arrested, he wanted to continue to share his message and he confessed fully in an interview, Richardson said.

He said Roof's two-hour confession was recorded and will be played in court.

""He admitted that he almost didn't do it, that he almost walked out the door,"" Richardson said. ""But in the end he decided, that he just had to do it.""

In the video confession, Roof described pacing around the room, shooting victim after victim, Richardson told the court. ""He also talked about a call to arms,"" Richardson said, and hoped that ""this would lead to a race war ... that he could send a message to other white people to stand up and do something.""

Richardson continued: ""After months of planning ... he chose to execute nine of those innocent men and women. ... He pulled the trigger on that Glock 45 more than 70 times that night.""

Warning that ""this is going to be a long and difficult trial,"" Richardson said, ""We're going to ask you to find the defendant guilty.""

Richardson added: ""His assault on a house of worship will not win in this courtroom.""

In the defense's opening statements, attorney David Bruck told the court, ""He did it. ... You're probably wondering, so what we are doing here? Why does there need to be a trial? ... The practical reason is that the government has asked for the death penalty after conviction, and because of that, we have a procedure to go through.

""... The question is not just did Dylan Roof commit this crime, but who is he? Where did this come from?"" Bruck said.

""Our society does not order the death penalty if there are reasons to choose life,"" Bruck added. ""You're going to want to understand who this person was and why on earth he would want to cause so much grief.""

He continued: ""Among the elements of the crime are racial hatred, in considering that issue, ask yourself where this extraordinary degree of racial feeling came from. ... How much sense does this crime make? Does it make any sense at all? And if not, what does that tell you?""

Bruck said the jury must ""go deeper than the surface with this awful crime, and it won't be easy to do that. ...This is going to be hard. It's going to be unbearable at times. You are going to see things you don't ever want to see.""

Tywanza Sanders' mother, shooting survivor Felicia Sanders, took the stand today after opening statements, telling the court that she saw her son get shot about five times.

A tearful Sanders then recalled watching her son die.

""We watched him take his last breath,"" she said. ""I watched my son come into this world, and I watched my son leave this world.""

Sgt. Justin Kniess of the Charleston police testified today as well, saying there were victims on the ground, shell casings on the ground and a child running and screaming at the scene.

Video from his body camera was played in court, in which the sounds of people crying for help inside can be heard. In the video, someone points to the door the gunman apparently left through.

The video shows someone from the church come in weeping; police take her out.

As the video was played in court, Roof looked down toward the desk.

According to the federal indictment, Roof hoped the attack would ""increase racial tensions across the Nation"" and bring ""retribution for perceived wrongs he believed African-Americans had committed against white people.""

According to the indictment, Roof maintained a website on which he posted ""a manuscript and photographs expressing his racist beliefs."" In the manuscript, he used racial slurs and decried integration, the indictment states. The photos include one of Roof holding a confederate flag, according to the indictment.

The 33 federal counts against him include hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death. If convicted, Roof faces the death penalty.

""I was just waiting on my turn,"" she said. ""Even if I got shot, I just didn't want my granddaughter to get shot.""

Amidst the chaos and the bloodshed, her youngest son, Tywanza, stood up and confronted the assailant: ""Why are you doing this?"" he asked, according to Sanders' testimony.

""And he told our son, 'I have to do this because ya'll raping our women and taking over the world,'"" Sanders said. ""And that's when [the gunman] put about five bullets in my son.""

Roof, who is white, is accused of fatally shooting nine black parishioners during a Bible study at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church on June 17, 2015. One of the nine victims killed was Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a church pastor and a member of the South Carolina Senate.

Roof, who was 21 at the time, was arrested the day after the shooting in Shelby, North Carolina, about 250 miles north of Charleston.

Opening arguments in the federal case against Roof are expected to take place Wednesday.

According to the federal indictment, Roof maintained a website on which he posted ""a manuscript and photographs expressing his racist beliefs."" In the manuscript, he used racial slurs and decried integration, the indictment states. The photos include one of Roof holding a confederate flag, according to the indictment.

In the months before the shooting, Roof ""decided to attack African-Americans because of their race,"" and he selected black worshipers at a predominantly black church ""to make his attack more notorious,"" according to the indictment.

On June 17, 2015, Roof entered the Emanuel AME Church armed and ""with the intent of killing African-Americans engaged in the exercise of their religious beliefs,"" the indictment states.

""I forgive you,"" the daughter of victim Ethel Lance said through tears to Roof, who appeared at the bond hearing via video conferencing from jail. ""You took something very precious from me and I will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again. But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.""

Roof was originally granted permission to represent himself in court on Nov. 28 after requesting to move forward without his counsel, according to ABC affiliate WCIV in Charleston. However, Roof then sent a letter to the judge on Sunday asking that his lawyers be rehired until a verdict is reached and that he would then represent himself in the penalty phase. The judge has agreed to this new request.

There are 33 counts against Roof in the federal trial: counts 1-9, hate crime act resulting in death; counts 10-12, hate crime act involving an attempt to kill; counts 13-21, obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death; counts 22-24, obstruction of exercise of religion involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon; counts 25-33, use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/trial-starts-suspect-nfl-star-smiths-murder-alleged/story?id=43980969,"Two former NFL players have been gunned down in separate, apparent road-rage incidents in the New Orleans area this year: former New Orleans Saints player Will Smith in April, and former New York Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs player Joe McKnight less than a week ago, on Dec. 1.

While McKnight's family mourns his shocking death and the man suspected of shooting him remains free without charges while the investigation continues, the trial for Smith's accused killer gets underway today.

Smith, who was 34 when he died, was drafted by the Saints in 2004 and spent all nine of his NFL seasons with the team. He was a star on the divisional playoff-winning 2006 team that help lift the city's spirits after Hurricane Katrina a year earlier. He also helped the team win Super Bowl XLIV, its only championship, in 2010. He last played in 2012.

Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images

The Associated Press pieced together the following picture of events on the night of April 9, when Smith was killed, based on surveillance video from near the scene, police statements and testimony at pretrial hearings. Smith, his wife and two friends left a restaurant in New Orleans' Lower Garden District and were heading downtown when, at one point, an SUV that appeared to be Smith's seemed to bump the rear of a Hummer that had come to a stop on the street. Rather than stop, the driver of the SUV swerved around the Hummer and continued downtown. Soon after, a Hummer, whose driver was identified by authorities as Cardell Hayes, 29, allegedly hit Smith’s SUV from behind, shattering the rear window and pushing it into the rear of another car — in which friends of Smith were riding.

An off-duty officer, the first police officer on the scene, testified at a pretrial hearing that as he approached the site of the crash he heard an argument between Smith and Hayes grow more heated. Hearing gunshots, the officer took cover, according to his testimony. When he approached again, he found Smith slumped across the front seat of his car, one hand extended toward his glove box.

Hayes stayed at the scene, police said, and a handgun was recovered from the area.

Hayes, a former semiprofessional football player, was charged with second-degree murder to which he pleaded not guilty. If convicted, he will face a mandatory life sentence, according to the AP. Hayes is also charged with attempted second-degree murder, because Smith's wife was shot and injured in the incident, the AP reported. He has been in jail since the shooting.

New Orleans Police Department

Jury selection for Hayes' trial starts today and is expected to take one to two days. Once jury selection is complete, jurors will be sequestered for the trial, according to The Times-Picayune.

Meanwhile, family members are mourning another NFL player, 28-year-old McKnight, who died on the afternoon of Dec. 1 in Terrytown, about 5 miles south of New Orleans across the Mississippi River.

The shooting, which authorities called a road-rage incident, happened after an altercation that started on a nearby bridge proceeded into Terrytown, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said at a news conference on Friday, Dec. 2.

Authorities said Ronald Gasser, 54, admitted to the fatal shooting and that Gasser was allegedly inside his car when he fired three shots at McKnight. Three bullet casings were found in Gasser's vehicle, authorities said.

McKnight was found suffering from multiple gunshot wounds and died at the scene, the Sheriff's office said.

Gasser stayed at the scene, cooperated and was released after being questioned, authorities said.

His release led the NAACP in New Orleans to call on Kenneth Polite Jr., U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, to get involved in the case. The NAACP also urged witnesses to the shooting to come forward to federal authorities.

""We are demanding answers,"" said Morris Reed, president of the NAACP chapter in New Orleans.

Jefferson Parish Sheriff Normand said at last week's news conference that there was no evidence the shooting was a hate crime and that it “isn't about race.""

Normand also stressed that the investigation is ongoing and said, ""External influences will not motivate this office ... as to how we are going to conduct this investigation.""

Normand added that many people in his office are close to the McKnight family.

A grand jury or the district attorney will decide whether or not charges should be filed against Gasser, a Sheriff's office representative told ABC News last week.

Maryann Weileman, the mother-in-law of Gasser’s sister, told ABC News, ""Ronnie's a good boy. His life had to be threatened for him to have done something like this. That's the way I feel."" Weileman added that she has known Gasser 35 years.

A spokesperson for the McKnight family said last week, ""The family is distressed, distraught. This tragedy is something that changes all of our lives so dramatically. We are in the process of trying to deal with the grief and what we need go through legally. We want to give Joe his just due.""

McKnight went to high school in Louisiana before heading to the University of Southern California in 2006, where he became a football star. He later played for the New York Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs. This season, McKnight played in the Canadian Football League, according to the AP.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/suspect-fatal-shooting-nfl-player-joe-mcknight-released/story?id=43925806,"The shooting that killed former NFL player Joe McKnight in Louisiana on Thursday is considered a road rage incident, not a hate crime, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said.

Ronald Gasser, who allegedly admitted to fatally shooting McKnight, is cooperating with the ongoing investigation, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said this afternoon. Authorities released Gasser, 54, after questioning him overnight. There was no reason to continue holding Gasser, the sheriff's office said.

The shooting happened Thursday afternoon near an intersection in Terrytown, which is about 5 miles south of New Orleans across the Mississippi River. When police arrived, they found 28-year-old McKnight suffering from multiple gunshot wounds; he died at the scene, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office said McKnight was not armed and there was no gun near his body.

Gasser stayed at the scene after the shooting, and was then taken into custody, the sheriff's office said. He ""relinquished his weapon to our officers,"" Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said Thursday.

""We are interviewing a number of witnesses as well as Mr. Gasser,"" Normand said.

The NAACP in New Orleans today claimed the football player, who is black, was lynched. Gasser is white.

The NAACP called on Kenneth Polite, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, to get involved, and urged witnesses to the shooting to come forward to the local FBI Civil Rights Division.

""We are demanding answers,"" NAACP New Orleans President Morris Reed said today.

Normand said at a news conference this afternoon that ""this isn't about race.""

Normand revealed more details about the shooting, which he described as a road rage incident. Gasser was inside his car when he fired three shots at McKnight; three casings were located in Gasser's vehicle, he said.

“We have no witness account of an apology being made by Mr. McKnight to Mr. Gasser,"" Normand added.

Normand stressed today that the investigation is ongoing and said ""external influences will not motivate this office .. as to how we are going to conduct this investigation.""

A grand jury or the district attorney will decide whether or not charges should be filed against Gasser, a sheriff's office official told ABC News this morning.

Normand said many people in his office are close to the McKnight family.

A spokesperson for the McKnight family said in a statement that ""the family is distressed, distraught. This tragedy is something that changes all of our lives so dramatically. We are in the process of trying to deal with the grief and what we need go through legally. We want to give Joe his just due.""

And in an interview with ABC affiliate WGNO, McKnight's brother Jonathan McKnight said, ""My brother would never lay a hand on nobody. Even when he was going through problems, he would never hurt nobody.""

Asked about his reaction to his brother's death, McKnight told WGNO, ""I didn’t believe it ... Joe ... was getting everything together. It just happened out of nowhere. That’s why it hurts so bad for us.""

He added, ""My family was never brought up in the streets, we was always doing the right thing. My family put us on the right path. It’s going to be hard for a long time, just not seeing his face. We never lived that kind of life.""

McKnight went to high school in Louisiana before he headed west for college in 2006, where he became a football star at the University of Southern California.

Judge Richard Gergel told Roof that he did not advise the move, but Gergel granted the motion for Roof to represent himself, and Roof took over the lead defense counsel seat from attorney David Bruck, who will remain on standby.

""After carefully considering the record before the court, the relevant legal standards and the arguments of counsel, the court now finds and concludes that the defendant is competent to stand trial,"" Judge Richard Gergel wrote in his order.

A psychiatric review of Roof was completed on Nov. 15, the court document said, and a competency hearing was held on Nov. 21 and 22.

In his order, Gergel said jury selection in the case would begin on Monday.

The Charleston church massacre was quickly characterized as a hate crime by officials. Images and other evidence found online suggest that Roof held white supremacist views, authorities said.

He is thought to have spent an hour attending the Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church with his victims before opening fire, police said at the time.

After the shooting, Roof was quickly identified as the suspect and was apprehended the next morning in North Carolina, after a citizen spotted his car and reported it to police.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/outrage-grows-scheduled-appearance-white-nationalist-texas/story?id=43761020,"Word of a forthcoming speech to be delivered by white nationalist Richard Spencer at Texas A&M University next month has jolted many at the school and its surrounding community, sparking multiple petitions that have already accrued thousands of signatures -- including one calling for the university to cancel the speech.

Spencer recently gained national media attention after The Atlantic posted a video of a speech he gave at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank that is headed by Spencer.

In the video, he declared, “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” and members of the crowd can be seen throwing up their hands in a Nazi salute.

Texas A&M spokesperson Amy B. Smith on Wednesday said in a statement to The Battalion, the university's student newspaper, that Spencer’s views were not shared by the university, but added that there was little it could do to stop him from speaking on campus.

“Private citizens are permitted to reserve space available to the public as we are a public university,” the official said.

Spencer is expected to speak at Texas A&M on Dec. 6, according to The Battalion.

One petition denouncing Spencer's appearance at the school, posted on Change.org, has collected well over 7,000 signatures.

The petition originally asked Texas A&M to cancel Spencer's speech, but now features a correction that acknowledges the university's statement to The Battalion.

""It should be known that Texas A&M University was not the inviting party for this speaker and were unaware this event was taking place on campus. A private donor is holding this event under Class 5: non-Texas A&M University-related use of public space,"" the petition said. ""While it seems that canceling this event may not be possible, we can still send the message, loud and clear, that hatred is not tolerated by the Aggie community.""

The host of the event is Preston Wiginton, a white nationalist who the Southern Poverty Law Center, an advocacy group that monitors hate crimes and hate speech, claims has rented an apartment from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

Spencer's appearance at Texas A&M emerges at a time when white nationalists appear to have become emboldened in the wake of Donald Trump's election.

Trump, whose staunch anti-immigration policies were embraced by some of his supporters, disavowed and condemned the support of white nationalists and the alt-right movement in an interview with The New York Times this week. Subsequently, Spencer expressed ""disappointment"" with Trump's verbal rejection of his movement in an interview with The Associated Press, saying that he would ""wait and see"" how Trump would govern.

Spencer has been called ""arguably the father of the alt-right,"" by the SPLC, which notes on its website that alt-right supporters embrace white ethno-nationalism as a fundamental value.

Steve Bannon, who was named chief strategist and senior counselor by the president-elect, has been labeled a white nationalist by critics largely because of his former position as executive chairman of the right wing website Breitbart News. The site has been accused of giving a platform to the alt-right movement. Bannon has rejected those labels.

""I'm not a white nationalist, I'm a nationalist. I'm an economic nationalist,"" Bannon said in a recent interview with columnist Michael Wolff in The Hollywood Reporter.

During an interview with veteran newscaster Roland Martin of News One, Spencer downplayed the Nazi salutes captured on video. Martin asked Spencer if the associations with Nazism were ""offensive to WWII veterans,"" given that the U.S. fought against that ideology during the war.

Spencer replied by chalking up the behavior of the crowd to ""exuberance.""

He said that the ""liberal media"" had overblown the incident, and argues that his alt-right movement would have to make a better effort to avoid negative attention in the future. During his speech in Washington, D.C., Spencer referred to the media as ""lugenpresse,"" which means ""lying press."" The word has been characterized as a German slur and was popularized by Nazis, although it has been used in other contexts by German writers.

""People are paying attention to us now,"" Spencer said, referring to the need to present a more acceptable image to the public.",abcnews.com,True

On Monday around 8:45 p.m., according to the criminal complaint, Charleston police responded to a report of a shooting in East Charleston, Kanawha County.

According to the complaint, James Means, 15, bumped into William Pulliam, 62, of East Charleston, and the two ""exchanged words."" Pulliam then went into a store but when he came out and made his way home, he and Means again had a ""verbal dispute.""

Pulliam admitted to shooting Means twice in the stomach with a .380 revolver ""because he felt threatened,"" according to the complaint. Means was taken to a hospital but later died.

Pulliam expressed no remorse for the slaying, according to the criminal complaint, which also noted Pulliam said that after the shooting, he'd eaten dinner and visited a friend.

""The way I look at it, that's another piece of trash off the street,"" he said, according to the complaint.

He has since denied making that comment. On Tuesday, he spoke to ABC affiliate WCHS-TV in Charleston, saying he feared for his life Monday night and that the shooting had nothing to do with race. Means is black and Pulliam is white.

""I don't care if they're white or black. Nobody is going to do me like that. It doesn't make any difference he's black,"" Pulliam said.

Pulliam said that Means and two friends were taunting him that night.

""Believe me, I didn't want to kill anybody but you know, they are not going to kill me,"" he told WCHS-TV. ""I felt my life was in danger. I'm sorry but, I mean, I'm 62 years old. ... I work. I'm a good citizen. I don't do anything to anybody, never have done anything to anybody.""

In an email to ABC News, the U.S. Attorney's Office confirmed that federal authorities had been asked to review whether the shooting falls within the federal hate crimes statute.

""That review is in its early stages, and the fact that a review is being conducted should not be taken as any indication of what the review's outcome will be,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Ruby said.

The hate crimes statute ""establishes a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for willfully using a firearm to kill another person because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion or national origin.""

Means' family also spoke out, saying they did not want friends or family to retaliate.

""I'm going to leave everything up to the courts to take care of this man and to do whatever they have to do to make him be punished as well as my son had to suffer and my family had to suffer through this,"" Means' mother, Nafia Adkins, told WCHS-TV.

http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/election-leaden-swollen-empty-walked/story?id=43743767,"The morning after the election, I wrote to a friend, ""I'm so devastated I can barely love.""

The last word was a typo. I'd meant to write ""move."" After I read the line, I realized that the word ""love"" worked too. I was numb. Angry. All the stages of grief mixing together and battling for expression.

To me, the election results were less about the candidates than what the candidates revealed about we, the people. About who counted and who didn't. All those fears we chew over in the dark, all those unspeakable dialogues we imagine are happening, confirmed en masse, right there on the evening news.

As a female journalist who has worked for more than 25 years in a field where I was often the only woman on the scene, I am no stranger to sexism or any of the other -isms that pollute our population. I have been groped by male bosses. I have been sexually assaulted and raped (a linguistic delineation that feels absurd to me). I have been threatened online, the standard ""rape and kill"" shoutouts, but with them, insults so convoluted in their hatefulness that my teenage children would repeat them back to me as a joke, all of us laughing, treating it like farce, because really, what else could we do? You can't block the universe. You can't mute the world. Especially now.

And yet, I was laid low by the election results in a way I'd never been before, my breath taken.

""I mean, I can barely move,"" I corrected in the letter to my friend. I wasn't exaggerating. My body felt leaden, swollen and empty at the same time. I couldn't stop checking the news feeds, feverishly hoping for some small bit of something that would remind me that this world was still a welcoming place for my daughters, for my family ""of difference,"" for my friends and neighbors and extended family who did not look like Children of the Corn. I knew what I was doing was unhealthy. I didn't care. Mercifully, I have dogs.

And so, on went their leashes and my sneakers as I forced myself to do the most basic human thing I could manage: I put one foot in front of the other and lurched forward.

I ended up walking for five hours. It was windy, and the November breeze pushed the clouds past the sun so quickly the light flickered as if coming from an old-time film projector. Leaves blew at my feet, into my hair. Air filled my lungs. I meandered through neighborhoods toward downtown. At first I avoided looking at other people. I felt raw, ugly. But after a mile or so, I began to make eye contact.?

When I did, some passersby smiled. Others rolled their eyes. One woman, a stranger, asked, ""How you doing today?"" Before I could answer, she burst into tears. I followed suit, blotting the stream with the corner of my hoodie. Later, when I paused to allow the dogs to drink from a fountain, a man approached on a bicycle and asked for permission to pet them. I nodded, and he squatted down and leaned in, hugging my 90-pound pit bull around the waist, pressing his cheek to his dripping jowls.

""I'm sorry,"" he said, looking up at me. ""I'm a veteran and I really need this today. I just, I don't know what I was fighting for all that time,"" he continued, before standing and brushing fur off his shirt.

As he pedaled away, I began to sob again. And so it went. Walking and weeping, like a scene from an Ingmar Bergman movie that wouldn't end.

It was dark when I finally got home. My calves burning, my skin pinked from cold. I fed the dogs, both exhausted now, then reached out to the women in my life.

My daughters told me they'd gone hiking at their school. A colleague said she'd ridden her bike in fast circles around her neighborhood. My 79-year-old mother-in-law emailed that she'd attended two spin classes in a row. Woman after woman shared that they had taken to the streets or the athletic court or the field or the gym, trying to reassert themselves, their significance, their essential goodness and glory, with the simple act of moving.

I understood. I understood all of it. The veteran, so weary, wondering what he'd been fighting for all that time. The stranger, so vulnerable the mere act of eye contact leveled her. My daughters, my kin, my co-workers, running, stretching, sweating -- each of us forcing our heart to pound hard enough that we couldn't ignore it, that we felt it battering inside our chest like a bird. In action, we are alive. Our aches self-inflicted. Our limits pushed by ourselves. Our victories earned. Our value unquestioned.

Yesterday,? Hillary Rodham Clinton was photographed walking her dog in the woods near her Chappaqua house, face flush, hair windswept. Another woman, hiking with a baby in a carrier, spotted her. In the picture, Clinton holds the dog leash loosely at her side, a poop bag knotted on the end. She is smiling. She looks tired, but not unhappy. She, too, moving, breathing, trusting her body to hold her up.

Since the results of the election, a mere 48 hours ago, a rash of hate crimes have been reported throughout the nation. Against Muslims, against those identifying as LGBT, against brown and black people, against women. These crimes are being documented in every state, many of them occurring in schools, where racial slurs have found a new bookend in exhortations for Trump.

As any management expert can tell you, the culture of a company is determined from the top down. However your head boss behaves, so go the workers below. A sexist bigot is now the boss of our nation. And for some time, it will feel to many of us that we can barely love.

But love we must. The world is out there. We can -- and will -- move through it.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jeff-sessions-urged-caution-federal-lawsuits-alleging-discrimination/story?id=43690665,"President Barack Obama’s Justice Department has been unabashed in its use of federal resources to sue state and local governments over alleged discrimination, even hosting press conferences to announce lawsuits against the city of Ferguson, Missouri, for racially motivated policing practices and against North Carolina for its so-called bathroom bill targeting transgender individuals.

But Donald Trump’s nominee to become the next attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., may think twice before bringing such cases. In the past, he urged caution in how the Justice Department brings “its tremendous resources to bear” in court.

“It is a power that ought not to be abused,” Sessions warned a top Justice Department official in 2002. “Just because someone says it’s [a matter of] civil rights, maybe they haven’t done their homework. Maybe they haven’t studied the facts or researched the laws quite enough.”

During a Senate hearing reviewing the department’s civil rights division, Sessions expressed particular concern over legal action taken by the Justice Department under Bill Clinton years earlier.

He questioned the wisdom of a civil rights division lawsuit in 1999 that forced a North Carolina high school to drop its Native American mascot, and he cited a failed federal lawsuit a year earlier that accused the city of Torrance, California, of discriminating against minorities applying for jobs as police officers and firefighters.

“The civil rights division persisted, sued, and a federal judge found the suits so unfounded and frivolous that she ordered the government to cover Torrance’s legal fees of approximately $2 million,” Sessions said in the May 2002 hearing. “You should be aggressive. You should not allow and tolerate racial discrimination in America. But at the same time, you want to be professional and balanced.”

Under Attorneys General Eric Holder and then Loretta Lynch, the Obama Justice Department has used “fact-driven investigations” and legal action to “drive real reform,” one department official recently said.

Most notably, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit in February against Ferguson, looking to overhaul “clear racial disparities” in its policing, as a civil rights division report put it.

A month later, Ferguson agreed to a series of reforms, including the appointment of an independent monitor to oversee implementation of the agreement, known as a consent decree.

In all, Obama’s civil rights division has opened 23 investigations into law enforcement agencies and is currently enforcing 19 agreements with police departments.

Sessions has recognized that “within every department there are some officers who subtly, if not otherwise, are biased in the way they go about enforcing the law,” and he has said it’s vital that such bias be addressed.

In fact, he told a Justice Department official during the 2002 hearing that the civil rights division “has played an important role in delivering on this promise [of equality] by enforcing Congress’ civil rights laws in housing, employment and in the voting booth.”

Sessions said the civil rights division’s efforts “made civil rights a reality for poor minorities in the South and around the country,” but since then he has said little about using federal law to protect the civil rights of those discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender or disability.

For years he opposed the Matthew Shepard Act — which expanded the definition of hate crimes to include such discrimination.

Earlier this year, when the Justice Department was publicly criticizing North Carolina for its law barring people from using bathrooms that don’t correspond to the gender indicated on their birth certificate, Sessions was relatively quiet on the matter. But Trump weighed in publicly, telling Fox News that “the federal government should not be involved.”

In 2002, Sessions said, “There must be a consideration of balance” in the cases the Justice Department brings, and he expressed concerns over several lawsuits from the Clinton era, including a case out of the senator’s home state of Alabama.

In that case, the Justice Department unsuccessfully claimed that a white politician was elected in a predominantly black district of Dallas County only because more than 50 white voters were improperly moved into the voting region, according to The Montgomery Advertiser, a local newspaper.

“[We] lack the power to remedy the damage done to race relations in Dallas County by the unfounded accusations of purposeful discrimination made by the Department of Justice,” Sessions quoted the court as saying in its ruling.

Years later, race was at the core of a controversy over why the Obama Justice Department decided to abandon charges against members of the New Black Panther Party who allegedly intimidated voters outside a polling station in Philadelphia on Election Day in 2008.

Department attorneys had decided the evidence was not strong enough to warrant continued prosecution, but Sessions accused the Justice Department of playing politics and failing “to ensure that guilty parties did not disenfranchise other voters in the future,” as he put it during an April 2010 Senate hearing.

The department’s inspector general later exonerated the Obama Justice Department, saying “the legal and factual reasons” that prompted the case’s dismissal “were well considered” and there was no evidence that the case was abandoned “for improper political reasons.”

Holder came into the Justice Department promising to “reinvigorate” a department that had been rocked by a series of political scandals under George W. Bush’s administration, including what the inspector general found was “inappropriate” hiring practices based on politics in the civil rights division.

Many critics at the time said the division had deserted of its traditional mission to protect minorities, no longer prioritizing cases that targeted discrimination against black men and women.

But Sessions has rejected that sentiment, telling lawmakers in April 2010, “I don’t think it’s fair to say the previous administration shut down civil rights enforcement.”

And the Justice Department’s inspector general seemed to agree three years later, saying a review of civil rights division cases during the Bush administration “found insufficient evidence to conclude that improper racial or political considerations affected division leadership’s enforcement decisions.”

http://abcnews.go.com/US/san-antonio-cop-shot-giving-traffic-ticket/story?id=43672428,"A San Antonio police officer was shot and killed while writing a traffic ticket this weekend, a shooting that appeared to be a targeted attack, officials said.

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus told reporters Sunday that while the officer was writing a ticket, someone pulled up behind the squad car, stepped out of his vehicle and shot the officer twice, once in the head. The shooter then drove off.

""It's always difficult, especially in this this day and age, where police are being targeted across the country,"" McManus said.

San Antonio wasn't alone: cops were shot and wounded in Sanibel, Florida, in a drive-by style shooting this weekend; shots were also fired at police in Gladstone, Missouri. It's unclear what the motives were behind the attacks at this time.

""Unfortunately, like Dallas, like Baton Rouge, it's happened here,"" McManus said, referring to other cities where police officers were killed in targeted attacks.

""Attacks against law enforcement officers will not be tolerated in Texas and must be met with swift justice,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement, referring to his desire to sign the Police Protection Act, a law that would make targeted attacks on police officers a hate crime.

McManus identified the officer who was killed as Det. Benjamin Marconi, 50, a 20-year police veteran.

San Antonio Police Department

He said Sunday night that the suspect had not been caught, and investigators had not identified a motive, but it did not appear there was any relationship between the shooter and the person who had been pulled over.

A $10,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the suspect's arrest.

Police scanner recordings offer a frightening account of what took place, and indicate that the attack took place in the vicinity of police headquarters.

""I've got an officer down in front of headquarters,"" the voice on the recording said. ""Black male in a black Nissan. I need EMS right now in front of headquarters.""

The San Antonio PD posted a photo of a man on its Facebook page, asking for help identifying him and saying he ""might have information on the murder.""

San Antonio Police issued a photo on social media of the black Nissan fleeing the scene after the shooting.

""This is the vehicle seen fleeing headquarters after the shooting. The suspect is described as a black male wearing a hoodie, baggy pants, and beard. Approximately 5'7. Please call Crime Stoppers at 224-STOP with any info,"" the post said.

""We consider this suspect to be extremely dangerous and a clear threat to law enforcement officers and the public,"" McManus said.

The shooting comes in what has been a year of heightened tensions surrounding police.

Following the widely covered police shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in St. Paul, Minnesota, a gunman killed five police officers in Dallas who were protecting a protest rally.

Also in July, a man wearing a ski mask and armed with two rifles and a pistol killed three officers near a gas station and convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Earlier this month, Scott Michael Greene of Urbandale, Iowa, allegedly shot and killed two police officers in an ambush-style attack.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jeff-sessions-race-civil-rights/story?id=43633501,"The man who Donald Trump has tapped as his nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., is being criticized anew for decades-old allegations that he made racist remarks as a federal prosecutor in his home state.

Even then, Sessions insisted he harbored no racial bias and disputed the allegations made against him during hearings on his nomination to be a federal judge. Others alleged -- under oath -- that he once called a white civil rights lawyer a “disgrace to his race” and dubbed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ""un-American.""

But what has Sessions said on other matters involving race? And what does his record otherwise reveal about how he may lead what he’s called the nation’s “greatest department”?

His remarks and actions have run the gamut, from prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan and promoting legislation that honors civil rights leader Rosa Parks, to opposing gay marriage and the inclusion of sexual orientation as a federal hate crime.

Here are some of Sessions' remarks on topics such as bias in policing, gay rights, investigative priorities and affirmative action.

BIAS IN POLICING: COMMUNITIES VS. LAW ENFORCEMENT

During an August 2001 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was looking at legislation to penalize police departments that continue to make traffic and other stops based on race, Sessions acknowledged bias in policing.

“I think it is likely that within every department there are some officers who subtly, if not otherwise, are biased in the way they go about enforcing the law. I think that is just life. We know that to be true,” Sessions said. “It is not legitimate that an American citizen feels that they are more likely to be arrested or held to account or stopped and searched than someone else simply because of the color of their skin. ... Most people are not going to file a lawsuit if they have been mistreated. They are just going to nurse a grudge and feel like their country hasn't treated them fairly. So that is why we need to deal with it and keep talking about it and see if we can come up with a policy that will work.”

Sessions also welcomed the “heightened attention” on racial profiling, saying more discussions had already “improved some of the things that have happened.”

But the senator expressed concern that police “might be in a Catch-22” -– navigating the prospect of disproportionate policing and “legitimate” concerns of a minority community “afraid for their lives and their children's lives.” If police are “more aggressive in a neighborhood where the high crime rate is, which may be a minority neighborhood, [they] might be criticized statistically in some way under this,” Sessions said. “It could cause an officer to be intimidated from doing the very things necessary to protect the African-American community if we misread the data, if we over-read the data.”

Fourteen years later, during another Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sessions said he believes “community-based policing is a great thing,” but, “it is clear that police officers all over America are concerned” about legal actions taken by the Justice Department against police officers and police departments.

“I do think it’s a real problem when we have Black Lives Matter making statements that are really radical, that are absolutely false,” Sessions said during the November 2015 hearing. He expressed concern that, in his view, officials within the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division had yet to criticize statements made by Black Lives Matter such as ""Pigs in a Blanket, Fry ‘Em Like Bacon.""

During the hearing, Sessions said an “experienced law enforcement officer” in Alabama told him “the kinds of problems we’re seeing and the legal actions that have been taken and the marches in protest about police do have the tendency to cause [police]...to stay under the shade tree, and not walk the streets.”

GAY, LESBIAN AND TRANSGENDER RIGHTS ISSUES

In June 2015, when the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, Sessions issued a statement saying the nation’s highest court had “redefined a sacred and ancient institution.”

“It is not an act of courage but supreme arrogance to pretend that the wisdom of five judges is greater than all the men and women who have voted upon this issue in the 50 states, and the men and women whose convictions have defined the course of western civilization,” the statement continued. Sessions said the Supreme Court’s decision was “part of a continuing effort to secularize” the country “by force and intimidation.” He concluded: “[W]hether these progressive victories are transient, or permanent, depends on us.”

In January 2015, Sessions said the Obama administration’s decision to abandon the Defense of Marriage Act “still galls me.” “It was shameful and disgraceful and an abandonment of the rule of law,” he said.

When the U.S. government in late 2010 was considering a repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” Sessions said he was “inclined” to believe the policy “has been pretty effective, and I'm dubious about the change, although I fully recognize that good people could disagree on that subject.” He also said the public discussion on the matter was “probably” having “some disruptive effect on the military.” “It's probably not been good for morale,” and problems “have arisen from it,” he told the Senate Armed Services Committee in December of that year.

For years, Sessions opposed the Matthew Shepard Act -- which would expand the definition of “hate crimes” to include attacks on people based on their sexual orientation, gender or disability. During a June 2009 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions said the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which boosted protections of African-Americans, “was based on a demonstrated need” – unlike those covered by the new legislation. “When we now carve out a different class of people that may also deserve that kind of protection, we need … to explain why these cases are such that they are not being adequately prosecuted by state courts, why they're not being adequately prosecuted throughout the system, and why we need to have the federal government take over prosecutions that they have not taken over before,” Sessions said. “People are concerned with how we are picking and choosing the people who receive the extra protection.”

More than a decade earlier, in 1997, when Senate Democrats were planning to introduce legislation making it a federal civil rights crime to target someone based on their sexual orientation, gender or disabilities, a spokesman for Sessions said the Alabama lawmaker ""would be reluctant to expand the definition of hate crimes but will wait to see the actual legislation before making a final decision,"" according to the Times-Picayune at the time.

VOTING RIGHTS AND VOTER ID

“I do believe we have voter fraud in America,” Sessions told former Attorney General Eric Holder during a June 2012 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “And if you do not have voter ID, I would observe that somebody can walk in to a voting place where they know there is a registered person on the rolls who was not a citizen, not alive or in another state and just say they are John Jones and vote for that person.”

He said states have “every right, and in fact, a duty, to try to maintain clear rolls that have integrity to them.”

PROSECUTING AND INVESTIGATING OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS CASES

It’s unclear exactly what types of cases Sessions would seek to prioritize in his civil rights division. But the cases he has chosen to support may offer some insight.

While U.S. Attorney in Alabama, Sessions prosecuted members of the Ku Klux Klan who killed Michael Donald, a young black man, and hung his body from a tree in 1981. One of them was sentenced to death, and when another was sentenced to life in prison, Sessions issued a statement saying, “Although Donald's family can never be made whole, it may perceive some sense of justice by the most severe sentence permissible here.”

Then during his confirmation hearing for a federal judgeship in 1986, a lawyer who had worked with Sessions alleged that he said the Ku Klux Klan was, “OK until I found out they smoked pot.” Sessions apologized and said the remark was a joke. “The comment ridiculed the Klan,” Sessions insisted ""I detest the Klan.” Nevertheless, amid several allegations of racially-charged comments, Sessions was blocked by the Senate from becoming a judge.

Then in 1999, Sessions sought federal involvement in what he viewed as civil rights violations against religious voters. He and other Senate Republicans urged then-Attorney General Janet Reno to launch a federal probe of Americans United, the outspoken group advocating for separation of church and state, which sent information to churches about the implications of getting involved in the political process. Reno refused to launch an investigation.

Sessions wasn’t as aggressive a year later, when more than 30 women were targeted in Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. At least one New York City official described the incident as a hate crime, but Sessions said federal authorities should not get involved in the matter, believing the attackers should not be charged with civil rights violations. “That's the kind of crime that's just essentially a state offense. It's the kind of street crime that ought to be done in state court,” Sessions said in a TV appearance days after the attack. Eventually, several of the attackers were charged in state court, and many police officers were disciplined for failing to properly respond to the attacks.

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

In 1997, Sessions told the Senate Judiciary Committee affirmative action was a “very, very difficult subject.""

""We certainly want to reach out and make sure that every minority individual has full chances and rights in America. But when we make that a part of a legal requirement of this nation, that the benefits and privileges of belonging to each American should be dispensed because of what group you belong to, and according to certain complex formulas of race and gender and those kind of things, we get into very troubling issues,"" he said. ""I think it has, in fact, been a cause of irritation and perhaps has delayed the kind of movement to racial harmony we ought to be going forward [with] today. I think it makes people unhappy if they lost a contract or a right to go to a school or a privilege to attend a university simply because of their race.”

IMMIGRATION

In 2013, Sessions stood by his push for legislation that would make all government services only in English. ""I think that is good policy,"" Session told ABC News in 2013. ""We want Americans who come here lawfully to be able to operate in the English language. ... I do believe English should be the common language and it helps immigrants to effectively advance if they do master English and I think that's perfectly reasonable.""

Sessions has said that comprehensive immigration reform “is not the civil rights movement.” In January 2015, he said it is “a huge erosion of constitutional powers of the United States Congress when the president of the United States, in contradiction to law, gives lawful status to people who are here unlawfully under the law and not only that, creates a Social Security number for them, a photo ID and an authorization to work and a right to participate in Social Security and Medicare. This is a stunning event.”

RACE

Sessions has sponsored legislation on several occasions to recognize and honor the contributions made to America by Rosa Parks, whom he said “sparked the civil rights movement when she refused to give up her seat on a bus.” In 1999, he co-sponsored a Senate bill to award Parks with the Congressional Gold Medal, one of the nation's top civilian awards.

“Ms. Parks has come to be a living embodiment of this principle,” he said. “True equality, the total elimination of discrimination, and a real sense of ease and acceptance among the races has not yet been achieved. But it is fair to say that in the history of this effort, the most dramatic and productive chapter was ignited by the lady we seek to honor.”

Six days before Brian Kinder, a poor, African-American man, was to go on trial in Missouri for a 1990 murder and rape, the judge presiding over the case issued a statement saying “the Democrat party places far too much emphasis on representing minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to work, and people with a skin that's any color but white. Their reverse-discriminatory quotas and affirmative action, in the work place as well as in schools and colleges, are repugnant to me.” Kinder unsuccessfully tried to remove the judge and was convicted. In 2001, during a Senate hearing, Sessions called the judge’s remarks “insensitive at worst” (he initially said ""insensitive at best"" but indicated that wasn't what he meant). He supported the judge in continuing to preside over the case, saying, “I would believe that if the judge conducted a fair trial, there was not one hint that he did anything to bias that case, the [decision] should not be reversed.”

In the late 1990s, federally-funded research found that minority youths were being arrested and confined at disproportionate rates, and some state-focused studies found that young minorities received stiffer sentences than their white counterparts for the same offenses, according to the Associated Press at the time. But Sessions co-authored a bill that “would scrap the federal mandate requiring states look into ways of reducing disproportionate minority confinement,” the Associated Press reported in 1999.

OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION

During an April 2010 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions weighed in on housing discrimination.

“I'm a strong believer that many people are discriminated against and unfairly handled with regard to big items like homes and end up paying a lot more interest, and they may not have realized, as you said, just how significant that is; how every month they may be paying another $50, $60, $100 that they don't have really and could be avoided,"" he said. ""... And I spent a lot of time having meetings over in my state and with the housing people to make sure that our African-American community particularly took advantage of the housing opportunities the federal government had provided.”

During a May 2014 hearing before the Senate Budget Committee, Sessions commented on challenges facing women. “There's no question that … despite some progress, women do still face challenges, unique challenges, and discrimination,"" he said. ""They must have, in America, a fair and equal workplace for all our citizens.” He noted that the “workforce participation rate for women is now at its lowest level in 23 years,” and that “real wages for women have been stagnant since 2009.”

And he called working moms “heroes in the American economy.”",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/big-questions-donald-trumps-week-president-elect/story?id=43576306,"It’s been just over a week since Donald Trump was declared the president-elect, and he has kept a relatively low profile, holed up in Trump Tower in New York City, assembling his incoming Cabinet and White House staff and tweeting occasionally.

His inauguration is more than 60 days away, but questions are already starting to percolate about how Trump will lead once in office.

Here are five big questions about how Trump will govern that we’re asking after his first seven days as president-elect:

Will Trump’s Presidential Policies Reflect His Campaign Promises?

Among Trump’s first priorities once in office, which he mentioned when he visited Capitol Hill last Thursday, are immigration, health care, jobs and lowering taxes.

“We’re going to look very strongly on immigration, health care, and we’re looking at jobs, big league jobs,” Trump told reporters, after emerging from his meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

However, it’s looking likely that some of his policy positions will change or be tweaked after he moves into the White House.

In his first TV interview as president-elect, Trump did not dip into specifics of the wall he promised would be built on the U.S.-Mexico border. “For certain areas I would [consider a fence], but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,” he said in an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday night.

During his campaign, Trump promised to “repeal and replace” “Obamacare,” President Barack Obama’s signature health care law.

But in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week, Trump said he would consider preserving certain parts of the Affordable Care Act, including protecting patients with existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26.

“I like those very much,” he told the newspaper.

Will Trump Do as Others Say He’ll Do?

In the past seven days, those who have spoken with Trump have speculated about what he will do in office.

According to Obama, Trump said he will maintain a strong commitment to the 28-member NATO security alliance.

“In my conversation with the president-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships, and so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the trans-Atlantic alliance,” Obama said in a press briefing at the White House on Monday.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is said to be under consideration for a Cabinet post, suggested on CNN last Thursday that Trump isn’t inclined to forget his promise to hire a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton’s use of private email server when she was secretary of state and that Trump may use an executive order to build the border wall.

At The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council gathering on Monday, Giuliani said Trump’s foreign policy early on will most likely focus on destroying ISIS.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, “We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump’s not planning on that.”

Will Trump Cut Ties to His Businesses?

Another issue for Trump is whether he will sever ties to his businesses, which could present a conflict of interest for him when he is president.

Trump still has a stake in more than 500 companies worldwide and has not been clear about how his properties, assets and brand will be managed while he is in the White House.

He has been conducting his transition efforts from Trump Tower, the headquarters for the Trump Organization, and three of his children — Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump — sit on his transition team while managing his businesses.

How Will His Administration Mesh?

In his first major staffing decisions, Trump announced Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus as his chief strategist and chief of staff, respectively. Bannon is an anti-establishment figure, while Priebus is considered a Washington insider for his three terms as Republican National Committee chairman.

Priebus, along with Vice President–elect Mike Pence, will be Trump’s liaison with Congress.

Pence, who’s now leading the White House transition team, decided all lobbyists should be removed from his team, effectively dismantling the structure that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie built, according to two people familiar with the transition process.

Nevertheless, a top Trump aide denied turmoil, telling ABC News, “Transition process is not chaotic. Everyone is calm, but it could be sewn up better. Besides the public backlash over Bannon, there was internal backlash from Trump loyalists over the Reince hire. So, moving forward, the campaign hopes to be more strategic in their rollouts.”

Will Trump Be Different From on the Campaign Trail?

Will America see less of the bombastic persona we saw before the election?

At least for now, Trump seems to be using less divisive, us-versus-them rhetoric, instead opting for themes of unity.

In his victory speech last week, he said, “Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.”

In his interview with “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Trump addressed a small segment of his supporters who have been carrying out racist attacks and hate crimes, telling them to “stop it.”

After meeting with Obama at the White House last Thursday, Trump said he has “great respect” for Obama.

However, there are still hints that Trump’s temperament in office will remain a wild card.

He has still pretty active on social media. On Twitter, his favorite forum, he recently criticized the people demonstrating against him, before amending his tweet with a softer tone, and railed against the media.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/200-reports-hateful-harassment-intimidation-post-election-splc/story?id=43491050,"There have been more than 400 reports of hate-based intimidation and harassment since Election Day, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).

The civil rights organization tallied 437 incidents nationwide through Monday evening, based on direct submissions and reports on social media and in the news. The number has more than doubled since the group's initial analysis on Friday. However, the majority of reports came immediately after the election.

""It's way outside of the norm,"" SPLC spokesperson Heidi Beirich told ABC News, noting that such a quantity of incidents usually occur over several months. ""We do not see hundreds of incidents over a couple days ever. The only thing that is really analogous is the rash of hate crimes that occurred after the Brexit vote.""

According to the organization's analysis, anti-immigrant, anti-black and anti-LGBTQ incidents were the most common. Harassment targeting women and the Muslim community as well as incidents involving Nazi symbolism were also highly reported, the SPLC reports. The SPLC says that many of the incidents -- but not all of them -- directly referenced President-elect Donald Trump's campaign. The organization had the highest number of reports from California (51), followed by Texas (30), Washington state (27), New York (26), and Florida (23). These findings are consistent with those reported by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).

In upstate Wellsville, NY, a baseball dugout was vandalized with a swastika and the words ""Make America White Again."" The graffiti has since been painted over and police are investigating, according to local media. In addition, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced in a statement Saturday that State Police and the State Division of Human Rights have launched a joint investigation into the incident, calling it an alleged hate crime.

Nazi graffiti was also found painted on a building in South Philadelphia along with the words ""Sieg Heil"" and ""Trump"" with the ""T"" replaced by a swastika. Philadelphia police are investigating. In Rochester, NY, two rainbow flags were burned. According to the local ABC affiliate WHAM, local police are working with the Gay Alliance to investigate the acts of arson.

According to the SPLC findings, many of the incidents have occurred at universities. At the University of Pennsylvania, for example, a group of black freshman were targeted by ""violent, racist and thoroughly repugnant images and messages"" after being added to a GroupMe messaging account, according to school officials. The officials say the account appears to be based in Oklahoma; the president of the University of Oklahoma announced in a statement that school has suspended a student while they investigate their alleged involvement in the incident. A spokesperson for the University of Pennsylvania told ABC News that they have reached out to the FBI's cyber crimes division for assistance.

At San Diego State University, a female student wearing a hijab was robbed the day after the election by two men ""who made comments about President-Elect Trump and the Muslim community,"" according to a statement from the University Police Department. The university president said in a statement that the robbery is being investigated as a hate crime. At San Jose State University, a female student was attacked from behind by an assailant who grabbed her hijab, choking her and causing her to fall, police said. In a separate attack, an assailant attempted to kick a student and told him to ""go back to his own country,"" according to police. The university is investigating both incidents.

A woman wearing a hijab near the University of Michigan was forced to remove her headscarf Friday night after a man approached her and threatened to set her on fire, according to the university's crime report. Ann Arbor and university police consider the incident to be a hate crime and are investigating.

However, these incidents of harassment and intimidation have been most prevalent at K-12 schools, according to the SPLC. Middle school students in a suburb of Detroit were caught on camera chanting ""build the wall"" during lunchtime the day after the election. At a high school in Maple Grove, Minnesota, a bathroom stall door was found defaced with the words ""White America,"" ""Whites only"" and other racial slurs. In letters to the community, the principal and superintendent have condemned the incident and said the Maple Grove Police Department is investigating.

In addition to the occurrences reported to authorities, the SPLC has documented numerous others that have been shared on social media.

The SPLC, ADL and CAIR have all called on Trump to openly condemn these hate-based incidents. The SPLC also asks that those who experience or witness harassment or intimidation report it to both law enforcement authorities and to the organization.

""We would like people to let us know if this is happening in their community,"" Beirich told ABC News. ""This is very important to us to understand what’s happening in the country.""

These incidents come amid massive protests against Trump and divisive rhetoric protesters say was espoused by his campaign.

ABC News was not able to independently verify all 437 incidents included in the SPLC report.

Another Muslim woman in Columbus, Ohio, reported to police that a man verbally attacked her and her family while they were stopped at a traffic light, shouting, ""Go back to your f------ country.""

Other adherents of Islam in the U.S. have reported having their headscarves ripped off or ethnic slurs hurled at them in the days since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, and more than 200 bias incidents — mostly against blacks, immigrants and Muslims — were reported over the past week by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Trump said Sunday he was surprised and saddened to hear about hate crimes, racial slurs and threats reportedly made by some of his supporters since the election and told them to ""stop it.""

""I am so saddened to hear that,"" he said in an interview Sunday with CBS News' ""60 Minutes."" He added that the many demonstrating against him since his election should not be ""afraid"" of his presidency.

But anti-discrimination advocates say Trump's positions as a candidate have emboldened some who are prejudiced against Muslims to voice or act out their biases.

On the campaign trail, Trump called for barring all foreign Muslims from entering the U.S. His recent appointment of conservative firebrand and former Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor has drawn heated criticism from anti-discrimination and Muslim groups.

Nevertheless, some Muslim political and community activists told ABC News that they see Trump's election as an opportunity for greater political participation by the 1 percent of Americans who are Muslim and that they look to African-Americans' civil rights struggles as a model.

Antar Hanif

""Donald Trump is who he is, and he's our president. I'm not going to say he's not my president. He is my president,"" said Mirriam Seddiq, a Virginia-based criminal defense attorney and the founder of the American Muslim Women Political Action Committee, which she launched earlier this year. ""The things we have to worry about really have to go beyond our own fears of being singled out by this administration.""

""There have been so many people fighting this fight against injustice … far, far longer than we have as a group,"" she said. ""You can take off a hijab. Black people can't take off their skin.""

""I don't want to be the group that as soon as somebody targets us, we run and hide,"" she said.

Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, agreed that ""people need to step up their civic participation. I think Trump was elected because a lot of people stayed home.""

He said it is equally important that American Muslims continue to report bias incidents as a way of asserting their rights.

""You stand up for yourself, you stand up for your faith, you stand up for social justice and civil rights, and you let people know what's actually going on on the ground,"" he said.

Pat Eaton-Robb/AP Photo

Like Seddiq, Hooper said bias against Muslims must be viewed alongside the history of discrimination against other minorities, including African-Americans and Jews.

""It's the same phenomenon that has to be challenged,"" he said.

But seeing the need for Muslims to become more politically active doesn't mean many don't feel fear, some activists said.

A Spike in Hate Crimes Before the Election

Even before the election, the U.S. was seeing a spike in hate crimes against Muslims.

Hate crimes — which the FBI defines as any crime such as assault or vandalism with the added element of bias — targeting Muslims surged 67 percent last year, from 154 incidents in 2014 to 257 in 2015, the second most number on record since 1992, when the U.S. began tracking such crimes, according to the latest statistics published Monday by the FBI.

Then there are the slurs that may not rise to the level of a crime.

Asma Inge Hanif, the founder of Muslimat al-Nisaa, a Baltimore-area shelter for Muslim women seeking refuge from violence, extremism and religious persecution, said many women who have gone to her shelter recounted being harassed about their hijabs in recent months and being told to ""take that rag off.""

She, like others who spoke to ABC News for this story, likened the experience of Muslims in the U.S. today to discrimination against African-Americans.

Antar Hanif

Hanif is African-American and a convert to Islam and is among the one-third of U.S. Muslims who are black, according to Pew's 2015 religious landscape study.

""If someone can attack you based on the color of your skin and now someone can attack you because you're Muslim, you have no idea how angry someone can be or what they would actually do. That's why there's a whole element of fear,"" she said.

""It's reminiscent of being in the South and a black man running,"" Hanif said. ""You could be running, and someone would see you and say, 'You must be guilty' because you were running. And now the women are feeling similar — 'You must be guilty because you are Muslim.'""

She hopes that the divisive presidential election and Trump's victory will raise awareness among light-skinned Muslims of the need to see themselves as part of a larger fight for civil rights.

""Now they realize we need to join with those who have already gone through this and learn from their experience,"" Hanif said.

Antar Hanif

""The main thing African-Americans did not do is we did not give up,"" Hanif said. ""I would say the same thing to the Muslims who are here, to not give up.""

Experience With Harassment but Holding Hope

Seddiq said she experienced harassment by Trump supporters in the past week.

She was in New York on election night, hoping to celebrate a historic win for Hillary Clinton, whom Seddiq's PAC had endorsed. After she and a friend left Clinton's election watch party, they stumbled on a local restaurant where, it turned out, a group of young white men were cheering as states were called in Trump's favor.

Some of the men turned to Seddiq and accosted her, telling her she should be deported, she said.

""I can't take these people seriously. If comes from such a deep place of ignorance,"" she said, adding that she thinks that to some of Trump's supporters he ""represents masculinity and [the feeling] that woman are to blame for every problem they've ever had.""

Seddiq said she recently received death threats in her inbox, sparked by a post on a conservative aggregator site that linked to one of her PAC's press releases containing her and her colleagues' names and phone numbers.

Still, she said it's important to keep such experiences in perspective.

""I think that for Muslims to be afraid or to shirk responsibility or to shrink or act like victims right now — it's a little bit embarrassing for me to feel that way,"" she said. ""This is not just about Donald Trump. The only way we can make sure we don't get left behind is to be actively involved in the political process.""

Mirriam Seddiq

She and her PAC are already making a list of potential candidates, Muslim and not, for the 2018 midterm elections, ""with an eye, of course, on 2020,"" she said.

""That's what our faith tells us to do — not to despair,"" Seddiq said. ""All things that befall a believer are good. We need to take those words to heart.""",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/churches-vandalized-trump-racist-graffiti/story?id=43538621,"At least two more churches have been vandalized with what appears to be pro-Donald Trump racist graffiti, according to the houses of worship.

One of the churches, St. David's Episcopal, in Beanblossom, Ind., was targeted sometime Saturday, a Facebook post from the church says.

""Three tags were painted on the outside of the church,"" the post says, including ""Heil Trump"" and a swastika.

""We are disappointed that our safe haven has been vandalized but will not let the actions of a few damper our love of Christ and the world,"" the statement says. ""We will continue to live out our beliefs and acceptance of all people and respecting the dignity of every human being. We pray for the perpetrators as well as those who the derogatory marks were directed at.""

Rev. Kelsey Hutto said ""we must be doing something right,"" according to the Indianapolis Star. ""We stated one time that doing the right thing was not always the popular thing. We were targeted for a reason, and in our mind it was for a good reason.""

And in a statement, Indianapolis Bishop Cate Waynick said the tone of the election has ""emboldened"" some.

""We do not know who is responsible for the vandalism,"" Waynick said in the statement. ""What we do know is that the kind of language used during the recent Presidential campaign has emboldened some people to become openly abusive and insulting. Our option as faithful people is to be sure we don’t respond in kind.""

Separately, in an Episcopal church in Silver Spring, Md., a sign advertising the Spanish-language mass was vandalized with ""Trump Nation, Whites Only,"" according to the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, DC.

""I am heartsick, and can only imagine how the people of Our Saviour, one of the most culturally diverse parishes in the diocese, feel,"" Bishop Marian Budde said in the Facebook post.

More than 200 incidents of reported harassment and intimidation have been reported since Election Day, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Earlier this month, a black church in Mississippi was vandalized with ""Vote Trump"" and burned.

""This matter is being investigated as a hate crime,"" Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons said in a statement at the time. ""This act is a direct assault of people’s right to freely worship. Moreover, this matter is being investigated with all deliberate speed and we will not rest until the culprit is found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

Trump has been criticized for not immediately disavowing the support of former KKK grand wizard David Duke, although he later did so. He also has been criticized for choosing former Breitbart chief and alt-right hero Steve Bannon as his chief strategist.

Trump, for his part, has said he is the ""least racist"" person and, when questioned about the heated rhetoric that has flared up around the campaign, he told CBS News that he would tell perpetrators to ""stop it.""",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/hate-crime-rise-united-states-fbi-report/story?id=43529882,"Hate crimes in the United States ticked back up in 2015, after a 20-year low the year before, fueled in part by a 67 percent increase in crimes against Muslims, according to an FBI report released today.

Crimes against religious groups overall were up by 23 percent since 2014 and anti-black, white and LGBT incidents were all up last year as well. Most incidents -- nearly 30 percent -- in 2015 were anti-black crimes, the data show.

Crimes ran the gamut from simple assault to murder and rape.

In 2015, there were 257 anti-Muslim hate crimes, compared to 154 the year before, the data show. Overall hate crimes were up just under 7 percent, to 5,850 reported incidents.

The FBI publishes an annual compilation of bias-motivated incidents throughout the nation and the latest report was based on data submitted by 14,997 law enforcement agencies across the nation.

This was the first year that anti-Arab hate crime was recorded in the FBI numbers. There were 37 incidents and 48 victims. It was also the first year that crimes against Mormons, Sikhs, Buddhists, Eastern-Orthodox and Jehovah's witnesses were broken down.

The rise of hate crimes doesn't come as a surprise to John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and a professor at Rutgers School of Criminal Justice, as well as a former Department of Homeland Security official.

The numbers validate two trends that have emerged in the past couple of years, said Cohen. First, the country has become increasingly polarized and there has been a rise in the lack of willingness to engage in healthy discussions with people who may have different opinions, said Cohen. This polarization has been along political, racial and religious lines, said Cohen.

In 2015, of the 7,121 victims (there may be more than one victim per incident) targeted for a ""single-bias,"" rather than multiple factors, 59.2 percent were targeted because of race, ethnicity or ancestry bias. Nearly 20 percent were targeted over religion and 18 percent were victimized because of sexual orientation, the FBI found.

Cohen also argues that there has been an increased willingness of individuals to use violence to take action against a perceived grievance.

This has manifested in mass casualty incidents, assaults and in this case, hate crimes.

""At the end of the day, as our ability to have healthy public discourse had eroded, more and more we are seeing people turn to violence or destructive behavior in furtherance of an ideological agenda,"" said Cohen.

Hate crimes against Muslims haven't been this high since 2001, when there were 481 incidents.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations(CAIR)said that the FBI numbers track with its own reporting on anti-Mosque incidents, which include hate crimes as well as harassment, intimidation and zoning issues. The number of incidents last year were ""off the charts,"" said Corey Saylor, CAIR Director of the Department to Monitor and Combat Islamophobia.

There are usually one to two incidents a month, but in November and December of last year there were 17 incidents each.

He attributes this to the ""toxic rhetoric coming out of the election campaign.""

While the FBI numbers don't cover 2016, there have been more than 200 reports of hate-based intimidation and harassment since Election Day, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).

The civil rights organization said it tallied 201 incidents nationwide between Election Day and Friday evening, based on direct submissions and reports on social media as well as in the news.

While 2015 was the worst year on record since CAIR began tracking the numbers, 2016 is set to surpass it.

Cohen said the overall 2016 FBI numbers will likely reflect an increase as well.

Social media is also playing a role in emboldening violent behavior, according to Cohen.

There have always been people with extreme views, but communications used to be limited to the physical world. Now people with extremist views can find like-minded individuals online and seek validation for their violent behavior.

Of the 5,493 known offenders, 48.4 percent were white, and 24.3 percent were black or African-American, according to the FBI. Race was unknown for 16.2 percent and other races accounted for the remaining known offenders.

The FBI says the largest portion of hate crimes -- 31.5 percent -- took place in or near the home. About 17 percent occurred on highways, roads, alleys, streets or sidewalks; 8.3 percent occurred at schools or colleges; 5.6 percent took place in parking lots or garages; and 4.4 percent took place in churches, synagogues, temples or mosques.",abcnews.com,True

--TRUMP NAMES PRIEBUS AS CHIEF OF STAFF, BANNON AS SENIOR ADVISER: Donald Trump named Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff to his new administration and former Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president, ABC’s JOHN SANTUCCI and ALEX MALLIN report. Priebus has fostered close relationships over time with lawmakers from all factions of the party, while remaining steadfastly loyal to Trump once it became clear he had secured the party's nomination. Bannon on the other hand is a firebrand of the far right, whose website has in the past targeted many GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, deriding them as ""establishment"" figures. A press release announcing the appointments said both will work ""as equal partners to transform the federal government"" and to assist Vice President-elect Mike Pence in his new role as transition chairman. http://abcn.ws/2f6sSmD

--WHAT TRUMP IS SAYING: “I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,” Trump said in a statement. “Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.”

--PRIEBUS DEFENDS STEVE BANNON AS A 'VERY, VERY SMART PERSON': President-elect Donald Trump's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, today defended incoming White House strategist Steve Bannon against accusations that he sympathizes with white supremacists by asking the public to give him a chance, saying ""this is a very, very smart person."" ""I don't know where they're coming from,"" he told ""Good Morning America” of the critics. ""That's not the Steve Bannon that I know."" The strongest criticism of Trump's selection of Bannon, the executive chairman of the “alt-right”-favored website Breitbart.com, has come from retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an international Jewish non-governmental organization based in the United States.

--ANALYSIS -- ABC’s RICK KLEIN: Donald Trump said plenty about what he would do if elected president – which is not the same as saying his policy vision was a coherent or consistent one. So far, he’s been softening some of his harder policy edges in ways that should not be at all surprising. Portions of the border “wall” will actually be fencing, the president-elect said, and the vast majority of undocumented immigrants won’t have to worry about being deported, at least not immediately. He doesn’t plan to push for gay marriage to be reversed by the Supreme Court, but does see a future where abortion rights are protected (or not) state by state. Part of what’s interesting here is that while Trump cast himself as strong and unwavering, he will be coming in to office as deal-maker by nature with few items he would not be willing to negotiate. He could offend, or make nice, with powerful Washington interests – the NRA, the Chamber of Commerce, Americans for Tax Reform – in ways few incoming presidents feel flexible to play it.

ANALYSIS: PRIEBUS, BANNON APPOINTMENTS POINT TOWARD SPLIT APPROACH TO TRUMP PRESIDENCY. Donald Trump once famously declared that there are two Donald Trumps. If that carries through to his presidency, both will be represented at the highest levels of the Trump White House, notes ABC’s RICK KLEIN. Sunday’s unusual announcement of Steve Bannon as chief strategist and chief counselor, and Reince Priebus as chief of staff, suggests that the president-elect is crafting a split approach to governance. The inside game is set to be run by Priebus, whose savvy as a manager was cemented by the wide election gains by Republicans last week. The outside game appears likely to be the territory of Bannon, whose stewardship of the late-stage campaign found Trump the stride he carried to victory. Bannon brings a more confrontational nature along with solid credentials in right-wing media circles, stemming from his leadership at Breitbart News. http://abcn.ws/2g4i0dI

""And those decisions get made separate from him, which is the way it's done for most cabinet offices.""

""We had more calls during election night and the day after than in all of November of last year,"" said Greta Martela, Trans Lifeline's co-founder and executive director.

In past 24 hours alone, the hotline has received 542 calls from ""trans people in crisis, including many suicidal people,"" Martela told ABC News Thursday afternoon. She said that Trans Lifeline was only able to answer 187 of the 542 calls because of a lack of staff ""to handle the overwhelming and alarming volume of calls.""

Based in San Francisco, Trans Lifeline has volunteer crisis counselors across the U.S.

People calling in ""are concerned about a lot of things after this election,"" Martela said. ""It's already a difficult time to be living as a trans person, and now it's just going to get worse.""

Here's a closer look at what trans people are most concerned about following Trump's election to presidency:

'More Discrimination, More Harassment and More Violence Than Ever'

Martela, who is trans herself, told ABC News today that ""trans people already face blatant discrimination and harassment on a daily basis,"" but many fear Trump's ""hateful campaign and rhetoric"" could stir ""more discrimination, more harassment and more violence than ever.""

She noted that this year is the ""deadliest on record for trans people"" -- citing the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), which tracks reported killings of transgender and gender non-conforming people in the U.S.

The NCAVP announced the 23rd reported killing of a transgender or gender non-conforming person on Tuesday. It also noted that this year's number of reported killings had now surpassed last year's total of 22 reported killings of transgender and gender-nonconforming people -- the most it had ever recorded until now.

""We're scared these numbers could go up,"" Martela said.

The ""most dangerous thing"" about Trump ""is his tone and his hateful words,"" added Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE).

""We know from historical precedence and human psychology that if he doesn't change his sense of humanity quickly and dramatically, he is going to -- whether intentionally or not -- encourage a lot of dangerous behavior,"" Keisling told ABC News today.

Losing Access to 'Affordable Healthcare'

Martela told ABC News that a lot of trans people have called with concerns about losing access to ""affordable trans healthcare,"" including hormone replacement therapy, gender-affirming surgery and mental health treatment.

""A lot of people have been able to afford and get access to trans healthcare through the Affordable Care Act,"" she said. ""And now Trump just wants to take that away.""

Trump has said he plans on repealing and replacing Obamacare,expanding health savings accounts and allowing the purchase of health care across state lines.

Trouble Having Gender Identity or Name Legally Recognized

There is currently a social media movement to help trans people get legal help to change their names and listed gender/sex on official documents due to fears they might not be able to do so under Trump's administration, according to Kris Hayashi, executive director of the Transgender Law Center.

Using the hashtag #TransLegalHelp, lawyers are offering free help to trans people who want to make sure their identity is legally recognized before Trump steps into office as president, Hayashi told ABC News today.

Setbacks and Removal of Existing Protections

Martela said she believed that Trump could try to ""undo decades of progress the LGBTQ community has made.""

Though Trump has not released a specific policy plan on LGBTQ+ rights, he has said he wants to ""terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama.""

In 2014, Obama signed an executive order prohibiting anti-LGBTQ workplace discrimination among federal contractors.

Keisling added that Trump's attacks against other groups of people will also affect the trans community.

""He is anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-people-of-color and so proudly so and trans people can be Muslims, can be immigrants and can be people of color,"" she explained.

Despite a long list of concerns and fears, Keisling said she believed the trans community would be ""resilient and continue to fight.""

""We will do everything we can to take care of each other and keep each other safe, especially those among us who are most vulnerable,"" she said in a statement on Wednesday.

""Over the last two decades, we have made faster progress than any movement in American history,"" Keisling added. ""The progress has come through supportive and unsupportive presidents because we always fight. Transgender people will fight to show the people in their lives who we are. We will fight to show America who we are. We will fight to protect our children. We will fight against attacks on any community. We will fight to advance justice, and we will fight hard to defend every single advance we have made. We simply will not stop fighting.""",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/muslim-student-reported-trump-inspired-attack-admits-made/story?id=43442471,"A Muslim woman in Louisiana who told police she was attacked with a metal object and robbed of her headscarf and wallet by two men wearing Donald Trump clothing just hours after Trump was elected president admitted to police today that she made it up, Lafayette police told ABC News.

“She made up the entire story about being attacked, about her hijab being taken. There was no truth to any of it,” Lafayette Police Department spokesman Cpl. Karol Ratcliff said.

The 18-year-old University of Louisiana at Lafayette student, who police haven’t named, reported that two white men jumped out of a gray sedan and accosted her while she was walking near campus, striking her several times in the back with a metal object, and knocking her down. She also told police they shouted racial obscenities at her before fleeing. Police said they weren’t able to identify any suspects and that she declined medical treatment.

The report of the attack garnered national attention and elicited outrage today from the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, which issued a firm rebuke of the attack, tying it to the anti-Muslim rhetoric of Trump’s campaign.

“We condemn this rhetoric and this behavior. We call on all Louisianians to reject anti-Muslim bigotry. Muslim Americans and residents have the same rights that we all do: to practice our religion freely and openly, to live and work without fear, and to participate equally in public life,” the ACLU of Louisiana said in a statement.

But by this afternoon, the student had changed her story.

“She caused all this stir over nothing. I don’t know what her motivation was,” Ratcliff said.

“Getting people upset and afraid is not the way to express your discontent,"" he said. ""It’s just not the way to do it. And it’s not ok and that’s why there’s a consequence.”

The student will be charged with a misdemeanor for filing a false police report, but will likely not face any jail time, Ratcliff said.

“We’re moving on from it,” Ratcliff said. “She decided to tell the truth about not telling the truth.”

Despite this false report, other attacks on Muslim Americans have been reported since Tuesday. Authorities at San Diego State University said two suspects targeted a Muslim student on campus Wednesday because of her faith and made comments about Trump’s election. Police are investigating the incident as a hate crime.

Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election has civil rights advocates warning Muslim Americans to “be cautious” of their surroundings and to “pay extra attention to safety and security at mosques.”

""In times of crisis or in times of upheaval, often American Muslims and their institutions are targeted,"" said Council on American-Islamic Relations national communications director Ibrahim Hooper. ""We're not saying it will happen in his [Trump's] case, but we should be aware of that possibility.""",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/anti-trump-nazi-graffiti-structures-us-amid-protests/story?id=43442742,"Reports of anti-Trump and even Nazi graffiti have emerged after tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities across the country took to the streets Wednesday night to protest President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected victory.

On Wednesday morning, just hours after Trump was declared the 45th president of the United States, the emblem of the Nazi Party was found spray-painted on the glass window of a building in South Philadelphia. The graffiti also included the words ""Seig Heil 2016"" as well as the word ""Trump"" with the T replaced by another swastika, according to the Philadelphia Police Department.

The investigation is ongoing and police did not say whether the vandalism is being investigated as a hate crime.

The incident occurred on the 78th anniversary of Kristallnacht, when Jewish-owned businesses and buildings were attacked and destroyed across Nazi Germany. The Anti-Defamation League, an international Jewish non-governmental organization based in New York City, released a statement Wednesday expressing horror at the ""hate graffiti.""

“We are horrified by the appearance of hate graffiti on a storefront in South Philadelphia,” said Nancy K. Baron-Baer, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League. “Swastikas and the Nazi salute send a message of intolerance and hate to the entire community. The fact that today is the 78th anniversary of Kristallnacht adds another layer to this already sickening act.”

The graffiti appeared just hours before about 700 demonstrators marched through downtown Philadelphia Wednesday night to protest Trump's election win, police said. Graffiti also appeared in other cities where anti-Trump protests were taking place.

In Virginia, hundreds of protesters shut down several streets in Richmond, where several Civil War and Confederate monuments were defaced with graffiti. The words ""Your Vote Was a Hate Crime"" were spray-painted on the Jefferson Davis monument and the Matthew Fontaine Maury statue, while the words ""F--- Trump, F--- KKK"" were found on the Robert E. Lee monument, according to local ABC affiliate WRIC. Donald Trump disavowed David Duke’s support of his candidacy earlier this year, and last week, his campaign issued a statement that he “denounces hate in any form” while also disavowing support by a major Ku Klux Klan newspaper.

In North Carolina, graffiti that read ""Black Lives Don't Matter and Neither Does Your Votes"" appeared on Main Street in Durham on Wednesday night. Residents told ABC News that similar vandalism was found in other areas as well.

ABC News

In Nevada, police said the State Capitol in Lincoln was defaced with graffiti overnight or during the early morning hours. Phrases including ""Trump = Racism"" were spray-painted on walls on the north side of the building. Police are reviewing security camera footage in an effort to identify those responsible, according to local ABC affiliate KETV.

And in California, protesters were seen spray-painting buildings and vans with anti-Trump slogans in downtown Los Angeles. Police arrested 13 people in the city after protesters blocked traffic on the 101 freeway late Wednesday, according to local ABC-owned station KABC.

Meanwhile, widespread graffiti appeared on the walls of business and structures in downtown Oakland where about 7,000 people gathered to protest on Wednesday night. As a result of the protests, the Oakland Police Department said it made 30 arrests and issued 11 citations for crimes including assault on an officer, vandalism, unlawful assembly, failure to disperse and possession of a firearm.

I'm ABC Serena Marshall the day after the election. President elect trump has been officially named the next the 45 president of the United States and when the group's most marginalized. A him throughout his campaign the American Muslims. So today we brought together a group here in Michigan Detroit where closes to one of the largest. Air and Mary Kane populations and American together to talk about. What it means for the community. And what is snacks so if we haven't been introduced ourselves and what you're hearing from your feelings. My name's Chris Lovell on the local aunt Pinner and Connor couple companies start ups and a little bit in disbelief Lola hard it cohort today. I'm Shareef a Keogh I'm a civil rights lawyer. And hey. America spoke. An attorney 15 add drama I am a civil rights director and they know we have a lot of work to do. I'm fast enough online and the executive director of and it's the national and like Latina mother today. In the trials through listening to him outreach director of the students from community council and a local. Educator and the American democratic system works. Health outcomes IV among local dermatologists I'm also on the board of several nonprofits. And it's tiny reach across the aisle and work with a fellow Americans recognize that we are also Americans consume country. Minor resources should come executive director of the Michigan chapter of merger sake it's time for communities to. To come together and move forward and and mobilize and engage. That's been kind of topic point four today we've heard it from Hillary Clinton as she if her concession speech in Paul Ryan. Coming together as Americans so what do you senior community on how to Gina how to bridge what has become kind of a divide between communities. Hate crimes against Muslim Americans have increased to levels not seen since an outlet and so what do you see your communities of bringing together to. Well a couple of things I think that we have some legal scholars and activists they need to speak about the American system it is a robust system. Has handled transitions for generations. People have fought. Big battles we've killed each other's because of the rights issues we still have a process to resolve our conflict and that's the electoral system. It's over and it's getting the OK because we can use assistant of magic differences. And other area is I want the American community to understand Muslims. Are your neighbors. We are not to be viewed only through security Lance. BLU physicians educators. We aren't your business people here on -- to care for your children. And we have as much affection has for US you have for us. This morning I spoke to several my friends as for the trump campaign some very conservative Christian groups in the first base that is doc. We've known for many years we have a lot of respect you we want Justice Department's community we just have different perspectives we just know that we love you. I think that offered what is love Americans need to go back to harvest moon and we do care for each other and we need our leaders to unify us. Honey you green. I mean I agree with lot of that sentiment and an aspect that you know. Moving forward. The democratic process works and we see that it'll be taught history taught the world that we a lot of you know government says they have these you know there. There the elections we see a lot of bounce breaking out. Wanting their in this country for generations that we've seen is that there's always been a peaceful transition. And we're seeing it again. Like. Usher curriculum has spoken. The process works and we're gonna move forward and will use that process in order to better engage your community and that are. Better united communities and in the major where it was love. And that is something that we'll bring Allred communities together and not just the Muslim American community and after McKinney but the the American community because we are one giant community. It's overly idealistic go to say that what can overcome and a lot of this campaign this kind of and fear. I think of interest I have actually stand ups to watch Trump's son speech last night. And I think like most of us haven't had much sleep for up this cycle but. And then just watched Hillary's a speech and I think what was interesting was that. Com turned himself also mention that it's time you know it's time to unite the country great and done. And also Hillary Clinton mentioned the same thing I think that that's what. This election showed us is that there is in I was. Kind of formed on a divide and it cup pushed the divide. But now I think everybody is recognizing that we can't move forward until we reunite with one another. It we're tolerant one another we're inclusive with with one another and and move forward in the best manner possible for our country. So you see us moving forward together. And like I said he credits to have increased to highest level since 2001. Aren't you talking your community are they fearful. That means he'd love won't be enough. Has the conversation. I think for those of us who are in civil rights and efficacy or whose job it is to deal with interfaith dialogue and modes of tolerance and understanding. But we know that sometimes. Ugly situations. Matt sometimes often usually are ugly situations get better and I think. In terms of engaging this. The victory for trump. The Muslim American community. It will process at different phases I think one is to really acknowledge and admit the impact it's had. I'm no Muslims in terms of the rhetoric against us. And then at least two I think which is where in the feast where that phase is not unlike any other American in this country witches. Donald Trump will be our next president and we are gearing up to be the best Americans we can under his presidency. ST also another. Positive perspective. We saw the best of America as well we saw active engagement. In the political process. And record amount of people who registered to vote people freely expressing their opinion. Engaging. And that's really been at some model beacon for the rest of the world. And to be able to accept the need to transition of a new administration. And to move forward and unite I think that's that serves as a wonderful. Testament to what we are all about. And it serves as a great example for future generations. So. And remember you know that ended a day and to calm everybody's hysteria. There's a lot to say the constitution to say that Miller right sentencing before an election after the election nothing has changed. Just the people spoke. They want a new direction. And it's you know it's time for us to all unite and and and just and move forward and do the best that we can for our neighbors and for everybody. And that said. This is definitely ugly elect and others and a lot of that frankly. Falls on Donald Trump. And here's his bullying tactics and I think if he wants to bridge the divide is not. Our responsibility. And it's our burden to do that it's their bird and then there is attended the funeral Mohammed Ali. And one of the stories we gave him as an Atlantic Olympics they had and sit ring side in the gold medal boxing match. And after the match is over the American won everyone's you know chain him in. How about those guys congratulate him and then he tells a berth in these woods and take me to that to the losers locker room. In nobody was in this guy's got his head down he just lost the gold medal match united and American. Mohammed Ali you know shocks and Martin cases hey you did great out there you know show me some good move singing this is guys' spirits up. Nasser Mohammed Dahlan was beloved that's why he's healed the bridge divides so I put back on trumpet his supporters in Iran that elected him hey we're here invite as they would with. We don't always have to be one being an inviting you come come invite us we loved would be honored to be your guess. And help us yield welcome because we're Americans who. Well you know what. Set it right on this is where it says his next challenge. To be the leader of the free world and he said in his acceptance speech he wants you know he he he that's unite. And that's like Mohammad Ali he demonstrated his leadership. You know I'm sure you know that they'll be there mess that I'm sure the next thing that's on. He said he was a big fan Mohammed Ali allegedly did he come through it there. Is when he's in the winners here. And and to that sentiment you know. President electro what you want you know he sees is the winner he wanted to. And I think that's what drives a lot of his support has follows. But like Chris I mean. At some point we have to recognize the sentiment of the people in the country saying something is wrong. So you know we look at the symptoms and a lot of our community members are physicians we look at the symptoms and we say OK. Let's backtrack what was the last or entity. You know what are the people ingesting. And a lot of the saying. Banks and love this thing. Complaints were on the side of senator Sanders. You know the the elitism the establishment politics so this is very. Great assessment times forum here. Oh. And Arafat in the U invited way house I was fortunate enough to be invited to White House. For dinner at present Obama and you get there and you feel like you really feel that. They're disconnected from what's going on in the rest of the country. You think president is disconnected until at a south of the jobless maintenance done this job done and you that you come from Detroit where we have. You know 151000 palaces. Vacated in you you just up the road and definitely there water crisis and then go to it. DC and inflate these. Billion dollars complexes and in buildings and people living very comfortable leaving very well high housing prices and you realize that like. It fifth what this success that they're experiencing there isn't shared with the rest of the world. And the rest of the country and that's the rejection of the establishment was the theme to me of this this campaign to. And a dermatologist and and I had he would both urban and rural and suburban areas and I just had a presentation it after party with a dermatologist who coordinate a response to Flint. He's a way to Mittal and his teacher predominantly after American community and it was Rangel trust both the federal the state government in Flint. Predominantly American and I my clinics that my parents started and I'm part it's an important on Michigan and went for crash hearings on area. The vast majority my patients are white conservative Christian patients. And we were very close to each other but they are going to quite a bit four per hour worked for talented people who can make incredible things. They make a tiny fraction of some of the investment bankers and physicians and scientists and engineers they know and other parts the country. Why is it that dare suffering is any less important and the person Flint the suffering the same degree different ethnicities different environments. But the establishment is in recognizing that. And you and Michigan where is speaking now as machines. People are frustrated and upset and we as the most talent people in the country but we're me to perceive that we are second class citizens. And that frustration is also presidents and community. The most famous can actually supported Sanders in the primary to point of imam hail. So this tension is something that president trump can potentially address. But his tactics to Chris point have to change is not just Muslims. This has this bank TD I bring community women all the people that he was demonized for attacking and maybe this is a negotiation tactic in the except it. But at some point you go from politician. To leader and you learn how to cover and I really hope that president trump for all of those learns how to govern. So would you like to see him do to embrace the community. Particularly in was in communities that he needs to reach out perhaps it's his in the ball's in his court to make the effort so without look like free. Receptionist night and game and I mean if you are engaging. All ways Americans regardless of their religion regardless of their fate artists and ethnicity. You gory you engage in a fee discussions are you going to reach out. Crossed I have to different folks. That that helps look alleviate that concern. Adapters going to be one group of Americans favored over another group and that's something that's just. That's that the founding fathers would be ruling and a great tonight I'm sure. Mr. trump has that in mind in Hampshire you know again we haven't seen him leave yet whole country got to give him the benefit of doubt and a lot of things a lot of things were said. Both ways during the election advocates for air you know a lot that afternoon. People's full time move forward. And let's unite and heal the wounds and let's hope that you know about positive and we learned a lot. B button while I'm hopeful you can't un ring a bell. And the bell has been Rome and relationship to attacks against. The in the existence of Muslims in this country and while we mustn't you know bury our heads in the sand because he's sent several. And timeless somethings that is a reality and me our expecting and hoping. That he will do positive things to work towards you know on ringing that bell it is not just. Muslims in this can in this country or community either though it's kind of world wide talked about instituting a worldwide Muslim the end entering the United States. Once I salute to be labeled Islamic terrorists when you hear talk like that how does that personally affect you in your thoughts about how can overcome. Well there's a difference that squared education. Needs to be provided here that's what he needs to reach across imputed. More increased understanding them. Why don't we dealing with here let's call it what it is is that most from America that are attacking people if Americans are bearing their children home or. Self police acts that way out yet but everybody's supposed to felt policing it's not just one group which should be but it's. She. It is that the sinking last administration American Muslims are. Mean that people have every reason that this room that every against the united diversity. We're not always was preview for the security Lanston and it always meant to US security lands in hot and contribute. And president Tom can really change the language of the past the administration's. Yeah I think is. What about you can all of fellow Americans we have had spent trillions of dollars. In foreign wars now if you could use his words to try and mitigate some of the conflict because guess what the military option hasn't gone that well. And top of that who's paying the price is such an American Muslims some about. Own members of a Kenyan died fighting for this country what about everybody else. But the veterans remain would have by the lack of infrastructure what about early childhood development that couldn't find it would buy the streets of Detroit and the water and playing. Committee funded with money coming back home. So the opportune to use your words. Can make a difference come into a mosque in the United States president politics 67 years to come to a mosque. Presidential appointment over a must look at you polite and I spooky. Inviting him to Michigan midget I'll come on according. I think. I think of anything in this such as speaking as a mother I do with youth health and executive director of a student national student organization and around. In the past Tony for hours we've been getting off that the reports that are going on campuses across the country. You know I I keep on thinking about us is that you know it's. Where you know president from an and that's great and we had we trust the constitution because the bill of rights and all of the look the problem also is is that he ignited many people. Tour. Inflated by inciting violence and very with a spike and I hate crimes and all those things and let the responsibility onus on him also now is to bring those people and then also. Coming to an understanding of who wealth and not just him out of him calmed them off. But almost supporters. Have also been inciting the violence and those are the ones that I'm worried about what the people that. Don't own me. All I know what he said about me. And therefore that's what they're seeing the great so it is his but his responsibility but Altman's response all of every American can really. Like the united fitness. Considering make them sick I think it's. We would all agree that many Muslims in this country are sitting at the edge of if she now. Particularly those who are visibly lost some women who Wear head scarf. The man in our community that that look visibly councilman there's a wide spectrum of what it means to look most some. But the reality is most songs are. It concerned. As they have been throughout the selection that the Muslims are concerned as they have been throughout the election with the turmoil that has been caused. Throughout this process. And while in all its Monday morning as they say time to get back to work it certainly is for our community as well. There's a lot to that happened that that still needs to be addressed. Adding that's what you said and nothing shall situations a great opportunity. We saw throughout this whole election you know process thus was with the millennial you know in a generation. The amount of engagement the passion involvement was at an all time high. So we can take what we've you know we've Hilton entrance and be on the selection hopefully. Use this and you know. Strengthen our community and that via that process we have a lot of work to do. In terms of it educating gauging. And but. I think we've started something greater and I think to what this just in this this as Chris and called it one of the ugliest election cycles. Something beautiful has come out of that and and I think that this is something we can definitely look at as a positive and it that we can definitely move forward on this. Regarding that election has remember people and all who. Officer Conway. Who put his life and my seat to other Americans. You know when he got these he's using utility vehicle and daddy got musical star family but. People don't know about yet so. Probably know others from. The ugliness that we witnessed we also saw the good and and more which increased understanding of hate Muslims are part of the fabric of America hate that you did fight and they did. Say fellow Americans and they get put their lives on the line so. I think this process it's short term it's it's it's it's it's been very prepared for curious for everybody and actress Morton its many people bought. Hopefully in the future on just going to be an increased understanding and people have more resolved. And withhold judgment before or before his engine. That's our responsibility. The are responsible to knows education. More people are educated now about the political process than it ever you know. And and remnants they make America great again I think his campaign made America hungry. Where so we're we're eager to give it to get involved in communities have several young people who say I'm going to run for office. Right and that that's inspiring to hear because you know people say hey. If a man named Barack Hussein Obama but are from Chicago right and got as both the Chicago. If he can become president and then don't talk to become president and I can become president. So best of the salon looked a year as an. Educators. I think to define education we actually. Had when the lowest rates of registered voters and he ate its community of the eighteenth election. I'm pretty sure the and it it will not be. At levels of Jewish or Catholic men would be getting closer. Some organizations such as a marriage USA England either way initially and we did 96000 voters. We on call 20000 people we knocked on thousands of doors. And the dean of the election are people who didn't let it could vote on that date at the end of the day before. In that sense education and also agency since it. Your vote doesn't matter not because it's an account the millions it's your thought is you collective consciousness that shakes the broader. America and getting them write something that I think we need some strides. The other thing is just reaching out fellow Americans what happened with the electorate that supported him. It's not just hatred and ethnic groups in fact that's happening issues. Those that was cold for whatever else is going on what's bothering you to a degree that is going on. I don't happen with polling data comes from talking this Mena talking anybody else and it. You galleries. The camera right now and just saying. Why do you do and is and we need to get it but don't demonize us last night I was up until 2 o'clock but he's in these groups. And my children called me and cement like this crime and the kids. That's when things like that have to be I've compared it minding your burden to you if you are crying I'm responsible for you. And if Mike is a crying your response to that. My fellow Christian neighbors told me don't hiking your name you're an American and American that so you. Yeah. I've received some phone calls. From fellow Americans saying. Didn't even mention trump didn't even mention the election body with that backdrop from which they said we're here for your community we're here for you as Americans. And we know that you're you know the best Americans you can be. And so that gives us hope I mean that gives us you don't really energy to keep that this. You know. Engagement going and I think it's fair to say just in life in general sometimes you you know you lose the battle but when the war. And sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get yourself back up. Still we as a community are aware of that and are just navigating like everybody else sweep. The news of trumps election. Oh victory. And also with the news that our community has come out and record numbers to vote to be present we've had more on what some. Candidates. In the election and the state of Michigan and we've had had really ever. So that's the you know upset of all this. This isn't it to you onyx. And the president have been a lot of positive human mind you know this first unit on the Muslim American that's. Representing a citizen problem with one state representative you know. Title yesterday as well. We have individuals such decides has who who won in Kingston. A lot tomorrow you man he ran he ran he ran in a chance in a we have a lot of these individuals that you know that the fire does the spark has been has been that. And from here what are we gonna do with that sparked a reaganite. Are we gonna light of attack where a revote that's part we cannot let that sparked we got to continue with what we've built we got to continue with what the movement has as it has come across we are continuing to educate engage and homeless. Such an uplifting conversation. That's been such a pleasure of sitting down until the images how we started this conversation with your reaction to the election results and lights and with your hope for the future for America and tear communities. That's on youngster. My hope for for this beautiful wonderful country is for all of us to live. And in peace harmony and unification as Americans. We have many different denominations and many different cultures and many different religions. But that's what makes great that's an X is beautiful and I I want us to come together I want us to educate one another one arresting gates and I want us to. And be fully aware of the the true political process and I want us to move forward together handed and. On our core need to set deep clear this movement from many comes one. We need more momentum and the less horrendous. I'm prayerful and hopeful and I pray and hope. That we return to our foundation. That the founding for ugly. And we. Evolve it to what it really means with exclusivity. And they really full. I am a proud American always have been and one thing I recognize is that the whole world is looking at us. And it's time for all of America to be the United States of America and continue to be the beacon for the rest of the world. Looking forward I hope that as a country who were able to. Acknowledge that we are not without blemish we are not without imperfections. That. The the road is long and we'll be bumpy. But that our history has shown us we get it right even if we get it right a little later. And I hope that we will get right. All the issues that have been brought up and problematic in this election. And I know that together with the skill and the will we will overcome. There's an old Muslim saying this same fired it melts barter hardened steel saw this through this adversity. Regan and melt like butter and chest be more defensive or are we gonna unite and become strong and I think. That as you stated the world is witness is observing and how we react to this election. And how we move forward. In in a unified fashion and be dock to the United States. I hope really people understand how hurt Muslims were in this election and how scared are families have been in. They reach out to is they make us feel welcome and reaffirm that yes we are part of America America is. The country for all people. I thank you for joining us and participating in this conversation.

Why don't we dealing with here let's call it what it is is that most from American that are attacking people if Americans are bearing their children call or. Self police it's way out yet but everybody's supposed to felt policing it's not just one group. But should be but that it is. It is that the sinking last administration American Muslims art.

And top of that who's paying the price is such an American Muslims some about. Only member of a Kenyan died fighting for this country we're but everybody else.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/miss-church-burning-amid-increasingly-inflammatory-campaign-rhetoric/story?id=43273329,"The ""Vote Trump"" graffiti that was spray-painted on a black church in Mississippi is being investigated as a possible hate crime and raises questions of whether the rhetoric on the campaign trail has inspired some to act violently.

The century-old Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville, Mississippi, was vandalized and set on fire Tuesday night. Police are investigating who was responsible.

While political experts are careful not to make a formal connection between the presidential campaigning and the incident, they concede that the tone of this election has reached record lows.

""We've got increasingly inflammatory rhetoric, much of which has a racist, sexist, nativist tone to it. I just don't think there's any doubt about that, and I don't think it's just the candidates. It's clearly permeating many citizens as well,"" said Dan Tokaji, a law professor at Ohio State University.

Joel Page/Reuters

Donald Trump 's campaign put out a statement on Wednesday condemning ""this terrible act that has no place in our society.""

According to Tokaji, it is impossible and imprudent to point to the Trump campaign rhetoric as the cause of violence such as the burning of the Mississippi church. But ""that doesn't mean [Trump] is not responsible, I suppose,"" he added.

""I think the level of acrimony in this political campaign is, unfortunately, reflective of the polarization we've seen in recent years,"" he said.

The FBI is investigating the fire at Hopewell to see if there were any civil rights violations.

It is also in the process of compiling stats for hate crimes in the U.S. this year.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate-group-monitoring organization, noted earlier this year that the number of active hate groups in the U.S. jumped from 784 groups in 2014 to 892 groups in 2015 — which included at least several months of presidential campaigning — about a 14 percent increase.

The Alabama-based SPLC says the terrorist attacks in the U.S. in 2015, such as the attack at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, and the shooting in San Bernardino, California, contributed to the increase.

Heidi Beirich, the director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project, which tracks hate groups, told ABC News that she has seen the racist website The Daily Stormer spawn ""book clubs"" that essentially serve as chapters for the site's followers.

""That site in the last year has launched an organization, essentially,"" she said of the group, which espouses neo-Nazi and white supremacist beliefs.

""There's dozens of these chapters all over the year, and that's a new thing, and that will add to the hate list,"" she said.

Tokaji said that, despite the attacks on the Mississippi church and on a North Carolina GOP office in October, the rhetoric of the campaign was worse earlier on.

""The ratcheting up of the rhetoric, I actually think, was worse in the primary campaign because of the group of voters that Trump was competing for. If anything, it might have been ratcheted down a little bit in the general election,"" he said.

James Campbell, a professor at the University of Buffalo in New York whose book ""Polarized: Making Sense of a Divided America"" was published this summer, said that the negative and hurtful rhetoric of the campaign season will continue past Nov. 8.

""This is a very, very bitterly fought election, and the conflict involved in it will not end with the counting of the ballots. The nation is highly polarized, and we have two very polarizing and very disliked candidates,"" he told ABC News.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/thousands-donors-raise-170000-rebuild-black-church-set/story?id=43274098,"Thousands of people have contributed nearly $170,000 to an online fundraising campaign to help repair the Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville, Mississippi.

The church — which has a predominantly black congregation — was set on fire and vandalized with the words ""Vote Trump"" on Tuesday evening, according to officials.

Photos of the damage showed that the church's brick walls still stand, but the main sanctuary and pews inside have been charred black.

The church's pastor, Carolyn Hudson, said at a news conference on Wednesday that churchgoers' ""hearts are broken,"" but they were praying that ""God would allow us to build another sanctuary in that same place.""

Today, it looks like the church congregation's prayers have been answered.

A GoFundMe campaign started on Wednesday to help rebuild Hopewell M.B.Church has raised over $169,000 as of early this afternoon. The amount raised so far has exponentially exceeded the campaign's original $10,000 goal.

""I've truly been blown away,"" campaign organizer Blair Reeves told ABC News today. ""Donations are coming in from all over the country.""

Reeves said he is actually from New York and is not affiliated with the church at all, but he felt ""compelled"" to create the campaign because he felt the church deserved the same kind of monetary support that a North Carolina Republican Party field office got after it was recently firebombed.

""The animus of this election cycle combined with the potent racial history of burning black churches as a political symbol makes this event something we must not ignore,"" he wrote in the campaign's description. ""Only two weeks ago, the internet came together to help repair a North Carolina GOP field office that had been burned by thugs. Justice demands we do the same now.""

Rogelio V. Solis/AP Photo

GoFundMe regional communications manager Kate Cichy told ABC News today that Bishop Clarence Green of Hopewell M.B. Church ""has been added as the beneficiary"" to the campaign and ""only he can withdraw the funds.""

Cichy said that ""GoFundMe campaigns can continue to accept donations after the goal is met and Bishop Green has access to the full amount.""

Green did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for comment.

Meanwhile, police are investigating the suspected church arson and vandalism as hate crimes, Greenville Police Chief Delando Wilson said at a news conference on Wednesday.

Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons added that he saw ""this as an attack on the black church, the community.""

""We are well familiar that this form of attack on a black church has occurred many, many years ago,"" Simmons said at the news conference. ""It happened in the '50s, it happened in the '60S, but we're in 2016 and [this] should not happen.""

The FBI division in Jackson, Mississippi, is also working with ""local, state and federal law enforcement partners to determine if any civil rights crimes were committed,"" FBI public affairs specialist Brett Carr said in a statement.

The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in a tweet today that the fire was ruled as ""incendiary or intentionally set"" and an award of up to $11,000 was being offered for information that could lead to an arrest.

The ATF added that the Greenville Police Department ""is currently the lead agency"" and anyone with tips should call Greenville PD at 662-378-TIPS.",abcnews.com,True

Why an Honesty Poll Shows an Advantage to Trump, Disadvantage to Clinton. Donald Trump is currently tracking as the more honest of the two presidential candidates in a poll, although fact-checking of his statements during the campaign have shown he's lied several times. The latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll reports that 46 percent of likely voters believe he is the more honest and trustworthy candidate, while 38 percent believed it was Hillary Clinton. This marks the biggest gap between the two candidates in five ABC News/Washington Post polls that asked the question, beginning in May. ABC’s MEGHAN KENEALLY has more. http://abcn.ws/2fcpkT8

Why President Obama’s Campaign Blitz for Clinton is Historic. As he barnstorms swing states in the closing days of the 2016 race, President Obama is forging an unprecedented final campaign for an outgoing incumbent president not seen in the modern age -- and a move that could help tip the scale in Hillary Clinton's favor. Just how unusual is it for outgoing presidents to be central surrogates for their party’s nominees? It’s unparalleled in modern U.S. history. ABC’s JORDYN PHELPS has more. http://abcn.ws/2fcpkT8

TALES FROM THE TRAIL

ABC’s CANDACE SMITH: The gaudy ballroom of the Venetian in Las Vegas was filling up, as Wayne Allyn Root, a conservative radio host, warmed up the crowd. ""Hello rednecks,"" he exclaimed. “I wrote a book called 'Angry White Male,'"" he said. ""Trump isn't just a person, he's an idea. He's a big beautiful gigantic middle finger."" A middle finger, he said, to those who have ruined the country. In this sentiment, Root is not alone. Of Donald Trump's supporters, there is a vocal group that worry about a country that no longer looks like the United States they say they knew or envisioned. MORE: http://abcn.ws/2e2LUOf

ABC’s LIZ KREUTZ: Hillary Clinton made a stop at the Mirage hotel in Las Vegas to meet with back of house workers. Clinton made her way through the packed employee dining room of the Mirage, mingling with staff. There were big cheers from the crowd as she walked in. ""Hillary! Hillary!"" they chanted. One manager I spoke to said they only learned about her visit here 45 minutes ago. Most of the staff in the room gathered there once word spread she was coming. ""I need your help!"" Clinton said repeatedly as she shook hands and took selfies. ""Make sure you go out and vote!"" ""Madame president!"" a few people shouted. ""Well, let's make it happen!"" she said back. ""We will!"" a man yelled. The Mirage is part of a culinary union, however not all the staff I spoke to said they were members of it.

ABC’s JESSICA HOPPER: Speaking at Loras College, in Dubuque, Iowa, Sen. Tim Kaine commented on the death of two police officers this morning in Iowa. Kaine reflected on his time as mayor of Richmond and governor of Virginia where he dealt with gun violence and police officers being killed. ""I know the shockwave that immediately sends throughout the entire community, not just the law enforcement community but throughout the entire community,” Kaine said. Kaine also added, “That people just sitting in a squad car, maybe just doing a little bit of paperwork, will be ambushed and it speaks to challenges that we have. It speaks to violence in our communities. We won't know everything that we will know over the next few days. It may speak to mental health. It may speak to the over proliferation of guns. Every tragedy has to be mourned and families have to be supported.” The Clinton campaign announced earlier today the decision to cancel Kaine’s joint Des Moines event with Bill Clinton scheduled for tonight.

RYAN’S POLLING ROUND-UP

New battleground polling today offered some optimistic signs in some close states for Trump but shows major hurdles still remain on his path to 270 electoral votes, ABC’s RYAN STRUYK notes. A CNN/ORC poll in Florida showed Clinton at 49 percent vs. Trump at 47 percent. A Quinnipiac University poll in Ohio showed Trump at 46 percent to Clinton at 41 percent. But Pennsylvania polling from those two organizations shows Trump behind by 4 points and 5 points. And a Wisconsin poll from Marquette University Law School shows Clinton ahead by 6 points.

http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/naacp-calls-federal-probe-locker-room-noose-incident/story?id=43031556,"WIGGINS, Miss. -- The Mississippi chapter of the NAACP is calling for a federal investigation of a possible hate crime after an African-American football player at a southern Mississippi high school allegedly had a noose placed around his neck and yanked backward by a teammate.

Derrick Johnson, president of the Mississippi chapter of the civil rights group, told ESPN the incident took place the afternoon of Oct. 13 at Stone County High School.

The alleged victim in the attack, a sophomore member of the football team, was not physically harmed but was ""terrified"" by the incident, Johnson said.

John Feaster, the first-year head coach for the Stone Tomcats, told ESPN the incident happened inside the football locker room as players were getting ready for practice.

""I reported it to the administration and handled it as swiftly as I could,"" Feaster said.

""The individual that was responsible hasn't been with our team since the incident. I just want it understood, it could have been the biggest superstar and he would have been gone. I don't care who it is -- if you do something like that, you can't be part of our team,"" Feaster added.

The alleged victim's father, when reached Monday night by ESPN, declined to comment and said he and his family wish not to be identified.

""We're calling on federal investigators to view this as a racial hate crime. No child should be in fear of going to school. No child should be walking down the hall or in the locker room and be accosted with a noose around their neck. This is 2016, not 1916,"" Johnson said at a news conference in Wiggins on Monday.

Johnson told ESPN that at least three students, all of them white, were involved in the incident but Feaster, the head coach, disputed those details.

""To my knowledge it was one individual. It was not a group,"" Feaster said.

Johnson told ESPN the incident was first reported to the Stone County Sheriff's Department by the victim's mother, but that she was discouraged from filing a report.

Stone County Sheriff Mike Farmer had not responded to a request for comment from ESPN.

Johnson called on school officials to expel anybody responsible for the incident and said ""these same individuals came to school earlier this year brandishing Confederate flags on their vehicles.""

Johnson said the parents of the sophomore who was attacked have not been informed of any punishment for the students involved.

Stone County High School Principal Adam Stone referred comment to Superintendent Inita Owen. She and school board attorney Sean Courtney didn't immediately respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment.

""Allowing students to commit blatant hate crimes without severe consequences sends a message to students that their safety and well-being are not valuable enough to be protected,"" the NAACP said in a statement Monday.

Mississippi has struggled with a history of racial division. It is the last state that still incorporates the Confederate battle emblem on its state flag. In 2014, two out-of-state students at the University of Mississippi placed a noose on the campus' statue of James Meredith, the black student who integrated Ole Miss in 1962. Both pleaded guilty to using a threat of force to intimidate African-American students and employees. Neither attends the school anymore.

The names and ages of the students involved in the Stone County incident weren't immediately released.

The African-America student targeted in the attack has returned to school and football practice, according to Feaster.

""It's tough. I feel bad for the kid it happened to. That's where my major concern is,"" Feaster said.

When asked about frustrations within the African-American community in the predominantly white Stone County, Feaster responded: ""Trust me. I understand. I'm an African-American male and I was born and raised in Mississippi. It's sad that something like this happens in 2016. I just pray we can get it together.""

http://abcnews.go.com/US/anti-muslim-incidents-rise-us/story?id=42082037,"The U.S. is experiencing a spike in anti-Muslim crimes and mosques are one of the prime targets, according to civil rights activists within the Muslim American community.

Fifty-five mosques in the U.S. have been targeted so far this year, making 2016 one of the worst years on record for anti-mosque incidents, according to new report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim advocacy organization. In 2015, there were 79 recorded incidents, the highest number reported in a single year since experts began tracking the data in 2009, according to CAIR. In 2009, 13 mosques reported incidents.

“American Muslims in the U.S. are very worried about their safety, the safety of their families, the safety of their institutions, and they don’t feel that they’re safe to go out,” said Nihad Awad, executive director of CAIR.

Three mosques were targeted this month, all of them occurring on or around the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

The mosque once attended by Orlando shooter Omar Mateen was intentionally set on fire by an arsonist in Fort Pierce, Florida, according to police. Rocks were thrown through the windows of a mosque in New Hampshire. And last week, a tractor trailer was twice rammed into an Islamic community center in Laurel, Maryland, just outside of Baltimore.

In July, 14 mosques were targeted, up from 10 in June. CAIR attributes these spikes to the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida. The majority of the incidents in 2016 have been violent in tone, characterized by intimidation, physical assault, and vandalism, according to CAIR.

“No one feels that they’re safe regardless of where they live, whether it’s New York or Minnesota or in Washington, D.C., in suburbs or in isolated towns,"" Awad said.

Whether the recent uptick of Islamophobic crimes is related to 9/11, or to anti-Muslim political rhetoric championed by some members of the Republican Party, or a bit of both, is still unclear.

But Awad says it’s “all of the above” including “Donald Trump and his surrogates who have been taking cheap shots at the Muslim community.”

“We’re trying to understand why Trump is targeting the Muslim community,"" he said. ""One simple conclusion is he's appealing to people who are anxious, people who are angry, and uncertain about their future.""

""Donald Trump is using fear, is exploiting fear, is promoting and selling fear. And fear sells, unfortunately, in times of tension,"" he added, pointing to Trump's immigration, terrorism and national security policies of ""dividing America.""

The FBI backs CAIR's data. In a 2015 hate crime statistics report, 16.1 percent of 1,140 religious hate crime victims were Muslim, up from previous years, despite the fact that overall hate crime numbers among other religious groups were declining, the FBI said.

Awad argues that these incidents show that ""the constitution is being threatened.""

""Not many people see it that way but minorities, including American Muslims, see it very clearly,"" he said.

In recent days, reports of a Muslim marine who was called a “terrorist” and thrown in an industrial dryer at a South Carolina boot camp have also come to light. The incident, which occurred in 2015, happened just months before the suicide of another Muslim marine who was reportedly hazed and physically abused at the same boot camp.

Earlier this week, a Muslim Stanford student was attacked on social media for wearing a headscarf, or hijab.

But despite this perceived intensity of recent attacks, Muslims are a vital part of the American community, Awad said.

“I think people are becoming acquainted with the American Muslim community and they have seen how courageous American Muslims have been in fighting extremism,” Awad said.

“American Muslims were also among the victims of 9/11, and American Muslims were among the first responders. American Muslims serve in the U.S. Army. American Muslims have fallen for this country. The human face is becoming known to more Americans,"" he said.

Of the 2,996 Americans who were killed on Sept. 11, 2001, 60 were Muslim American.

“We need to see more political leaders standing for what’s right, and show the courage and the decency to push back against the hate speech and hate acts regardless of the identity of the community because we're all Americans and we all deserve equal protections and equal respect,” Awad said.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-mosque-fire-suspect-appears-court-denied-bail/story?id=42110218,"A Florida man arrested for allegedly setting fire to a mosque attended by the Orlando nightclub shooter was denied bail during a court appearance made via video conference from the St. Lucie County Jail where the suspect is being held.

The judge denied bail to Joseph Michael Schreiber, 32, of Port St. Lucie.

The judge also asked Schreiber if he could afford a lawyer, to which Schreiber replied, ""Absolutely not."" Schreiber has not yet entered a plea, according to the office of the Clerk for the Circuit Court of St. Lucie County.

Schreiber was arrested yesterday for allegedly setting fire to the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce on Sunday night. Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen and his family attended the mosque, and authorities said they believe the fire was deliberately set and was a hate crime.

The St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office arrested Schreiber after receiving multiple tips, according to Maj. Dave Thompson of the sheriff's office.

Thompson added that they found a motorcycle at Schreiber's home that was consistent with the one seen in surveillance video from the night of the mosque fire.

Schreiber was charged with second-degree felony arson, and authorities will apply Florida's hate crime enhancement to the charge, which will enhance the second-degree felony charge to a first-degree felony and will carry up to a possible 30-year prison sentence.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/32-year-man-arrested-connection-arson-florida-mosque/story?id=42098425,"Florida police have arrested a man who allegedly set fire to the mosque there and officials say the suspect had a number of anti-Islamic social media posts.

The St. Lucie Sheriff's Office arrested 32-year-old Port St. Lucie resident Joseph Michael Schreiber Wednesday afternoon after multiple tips pointed to him, Maj. Dave Thompson said.

According to police, just past midnight on Monday, emergency responders received a call reporting a fire at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, attended by Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen's family. The fire was immediately believed by authorities to have been set deliberately.

That day, the St. Lucie Sheriff's Office released surveillance video showing a possible suspect. The video showed a man arriving at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce on a Harley-Davidson-style motorcycle at about 11:38 p.m. Sunday.

The video shows the man approaching the video before a flash is seen. He is then seen running from the building while appearing to be carrying a ""paper and a bottle of some type of liquid,"" police said in a statement.

After receiving more than one tip that directly identified Schreiber as a suspect, police obtained a search warrant for his home, where they found a motorcycle consistent with the one in the surveillance video, Thompson said. Investigators also say they collected evidence at his home that linked him to the crime, police said, but did not elaborate on what that evidence was.

St. Lucie County Sheriffs Office

While searching Schreiber's page, Thompson said police also found posts containing anti-Islamic propaganda and references to 9/11. Sunday, the day the fire was set, was the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.

The blaze also occurred three months after the Orlando massacre on June 12 and on the same day as the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.

Schreiber was charged with second-degree felony arson, and authorities will apply Florida's hate crime enhancement to the charge, which will enhance the second-degree felony charge to a first-degree felony and will carry a possible 30-year prison sentence. Florida does not carry a specific hate crime charge, Thompson said.

Schreiber was known to law enforcement at the time of his arrest, Thompson said, and qualifies as a prison release re-offender,which would impose a 30-year minimum mandatory sentence. He also qualifies as a habitual felony offender and could ultimately be sentenced to life in prison.

Thompson said Schreiber's criminal history includes armed robbery, and a inmate release information on the Florida Department of Corrections website shows that he was convicted of petit theft in 2010 and grand theft in 2007. He was incarcerated from March 28, 2008 to July 6, 2009 and again from June 11, 2010 to Aug. 8, 2014.

Schreiber was being interviewed by police at the St. Lucie County Jail as of Wednesday afternoon, Thompson said. It is unclear if he has entered a plea or obtained a lawyer.

Omar Mateen was a member of the mosque but did not regularly attend, although his family did, said Wilfredo Arm Ruiz, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic relations.

Schreiber could also be charged with a civil rights violation as the investigation continues, according to the FBI. It is unclear if there were any co-conspirators in the incident, police said.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/convictions-dropped-tyler-clementis-rutgers-roommate/story?id=41978887,"An appeals court in New Jersey today threw out the convictions against a former Rutgers University student whose roommate, Tyler Clementi, killed himself after he was captured on a webcam kissing another man.

After a 16-day trial in 2012, a jury found Dharun Ravi guilty of all 15 counts on which he was indicted before he was sentenced to 30 days in jail and three years of probation.

He was also required to complete 300 hours of community service, attend cyberbullying counseling and pay an assessment of $10,000 to a state-run organization dedicated to providing assistance to victims of bias crimes.

Ravi served 20 days in Middlesex County Jail, The Associated Press reported, but it’s unclear whether he completed the other requirements.

Ravi’s attorney, Steven Altman, and the Middlesex Prosecutor’s Office, which tried the case and argued the appeal, did not immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment.

A request for a new trial by the defense had been denied, but the three-judge panel today threw out the four counts of bias intimidation against Ravi because of a change to a state law after his trial. One count of second-degree hindering apprehension was also thrown out.

The judges also ordered a new trial on the 10 other counts for which Ravi was indicted -- including invasion of privacy, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension – because the evidence used to prove the bias charges ""tainted the jury's verdict on the remaining charges, depriving defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial.""

It was ""unreasonable"" to expect a ""rational juror to remain unaffected"" by the evidence provided by the prosecution “to prove the bias intimidation charges,” according to the judiciary opinion.

Rutgers University matched Ravi and Clementi as roommates for the fall 2010 semester, and an email alerting Ravi to his roommate match also provided him with Clementi's contact information, according to the judiciary opinion. Ravi and a friend were then able to learn that someone using Clementi's email address was posting to a gay forum.

On Sept. 19, 2010, less than a month after Ravi and Clementi moved into their dorm, Ravi told friends that Clementi had asked to have the room to himself, the opinion stated. One of Ravi's friends, characterized as M.W., testified that Ravi had set up his computer to auto-accept video chat requests.

When Ravi then used M.W.'s computer to video chat his own computer, an image of Clementi kissing a man came on the screen, according to the appeal judges' decision. The room was dark, but M.W. testified that she could see that the men were standing and fully clothed. After about two seconds, she and Ravi closed the computer, she testified.

The two had resolved to not tell anyone, M.W. told prosecutors. Two days later, Ravi texted M.W. indicating that Clementi had asked for the room to himself again, according to the judges' opinion. That night, Ravi enlisted the help of another friend as he moved the angle of the webcam to put Clementi's bed squarely into view.

Ravi had alerted several friends to the function and texted one friend saying that people were ""having a viewing party"" in another dorm room, but texted her the next day saying the webcam ""got messed up and didn't work.""

Clementi became aware of Ravi's webcam plan, writing ""roommate used webcame to spy on me"" on a room change application on in the early morning hours of Sept. 21.

The next day, he jumped off the George Washington Bridge. His death sparked a national conversation about the emergence of cyberbullying.

None of the counts against Ravi are in direct connection to Clementi’s death.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/sc-police-officer-michael-slager-federal-court/story?id=41740865,"The federal trial for Michael Slager, a white former police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man in South Carolina, has been continued until next year.

Slager is accused of murder in the fatal shooting of Walter Scott during a traffic stop in North Charleston in April 2015. Dashcam video captured Slager, who was a North Charleston Police Department officer, standing at Scott's car.

The video also captured Scott’s running away. Witness video appeared to show the moment Slager, now 34, fatally shot Scott, 50, as he ran away.

Today's federal court hearing -- attended by Scott's parents, brother and other family members -- stemmed from civil rights charges against Slager: a federal civil rights offense, using a firearm during the commission of the civil rights offense and obstruction of justice.

Slager appeared in court today without any of his family present, as the brief hearing addressed defense evidence to which federal prosecutors want access. The defense agreed to provide a searchable hard drive of the evidence requested, which includes rough notes, photographs and documents.

Defense lawyers, meanwhile, said the government has provided little discovery for the federal trial and that the government is relying on discovery from the state case.

The judge then moved the federal trial to sometime between January and March 2017, after the state trial on Slager’s murder charge that is set for this October.

In moving the federal case to next year, Judge David Norton today said of Slager's attorney, Andy Savage, ""Andy Savage is a fine lawyer, but he can't be in two places at one time,"" referring to Savage’s representing Slager in both the federal and state trials.

Savage was not in court today; Donald McCune, another attorney from Savage's law firm, filled in for him. Norton did not mention why Savage was absent.

The federal court indictment alleges Slager ""used excessive force when he shot and killed Walter Scott without legal justification,"" the Department of Justice announced this May.

""Slager was also charged with obstruction of justice for making false statements to South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) investigators with the intent to impede the investigation into the shooting,"" the Department of Justice said. ""The indictment alleges that Slager intentionally misled SLED investigators by claiming that Scott was coming toward him with a Taser at the time that Slager fired his weapon, when in truth, Scott was running away.""

Slager, who is free on bond, pleaded not guilty in May to the federal counts, according to The Associated Press.

On the state murder charge, for which he also pled not guilty, Slager will appear in state court at a trial set to start on Oct. 31.

Stanley ""Vernon"" Majors, 61, was charged with first-degree murder in Jabara's death and possession of a firearm after a formal conviction of a felony, the Tulsa County District Attorney announced today. In addition, Majors is accused of misdemeanor malicious intimidation or harassment with specific intent to intimidate and harass because of race, color, religion, ancestry and national origin. He ""did threaten to harm"" Jabara's mother, Haifa, and her family, prosecutors said.

Majors was also charged with misdemeanor threatening an act of violence.

In a statement, the family said they ""continue to struggle"" with the loss of Jabara.

""In charging Majors with a hate crime in addition to first degree murder, the district attorney's office is making a much-needed and powerful statement that hatred and violence based on race, color, religion, ancestry, and national origin has no place in our society,"" the family said.

On Aug. 12, Majors allegedly shot and killed Jabara, the Tulsa Police Department said. Earlier that evening, police had responded to a 911 call made by Jabara, but left the scene after they were ""unable to locate any criminal activity,"" they said.

""If we knock on the door and [Majors] doesn’t answer, there’s nothing that gives us the opportunity to go into his house,"" Tulsa Police Sgt. Dave Walker told ABC News last week.

Police said that there had been ""many calls to the area that involved Majors acting aggressively towards his neighbors."" In an interview with ABC News, Jabara's sister, Victoria Jabara Williams, said Majors increasingly bullied the family by calling them racial slurs, throwing rocks, and even running her mother over with a car.

Majors is currently awaiting trial on an assault with a deadly weapon charge involving Haifa Jabara stemming from 2015, according to authorities. He was initially held without bond, but a judge allowed his release three months ago, according to CNN. Majors had pleaded not guilty in that case.

Police said Majors had a protective order against him ""that stated that he was supposed to stay a certain number of feet away from the victim's mother and household.""

""The protective order was issued by the Tulsa County District Courts,"" police said. ""The Tulsa Police Department does not determine who can live somewhere and who can’t. We would only take action if someone were to violate that protective order.""

The family emigrated to the United States from Lebanon and settled in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, in the 1980s, Williams said.

""We were scared,"" Williams told ABC News. ""He just terrorized us. He was hateful, just hateful.""

Williams said she believes hate was a motivation in her brother’s murder.

""This was hate driven,"" she told ABC News. ""Why our family? Why is there so much hate in your heart?""

In a family statement, Williams said that Majors was someone they ""continuously brought to law enforcement's attention."" When Jabara called police the night of his death, he stated that Majors ""had a gun"" and ""was scared for what might happen,"" Williams said.

""He repeatedly attacked our ethnicity and perceived religion, making racist comments,"" she continued.

Williams said she believes hate was a motivation in her brother’s murder.

""This was hate driven,"" she told ABC News. ""Why our family? Why is there so much hate in your heart?""

But police aren’t convinced that Khalid Jabara's shooting death was a hate crime.

At about 7:45 this morning, Roof was near the showers when another inmate, Dwayne Stafford, left his cell, ran down a set of stairs and toward Roof and assaulted him, officials said.

Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Stafford, 25, punched Roof, 22, ""a number of times and assaulted him quickly.""

Roof was hit in the face and body and suffered bruising to his face and back, the incident report states. Detention officers intervened.The incident report calls the assault ""unprovoked,"" and Roof and Stafford were ""checked by medical at the jail and cleared,"" the report states.

Roof's injuries were ""relatively minor,"" Cannon said, and he was not hospitalized, a jail representative said.

Stafford is serving time for strong-arm robbery and assaulting a police officer, Cannon said. An arrest warrant for Stafford is expected. Cannon said Roof and his attorney have no desire to press charges against Stafford.

The investigation is ongoing, and Cannon did not say what sparked the incident. He said Stafford should not have been able to get out of his cell, and how that happened is among the issues being investigated. Cannon added the assault did not seem ""coordinated.""

Roof, who is accused of murder and hate crimes, faces a federal trial set for November and a state trial set to begin early next year. He could face the death penalty in both cases.

His state and federal attorneys have said he is willing to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/dylann-roofs-lawyers-file-challenge-death-penalty-unconstituational/story?id=41059561,"Defense attorneys of accused killer Dylan Roof filed a legal challenge to the capital punishment being sought by federal prosecutors in his murder trial on Monday night, arguing the punishment is unconstitutional.

""[T]his Court should rule that the federal death penalty constitutes a legally prohibited, arbitrary, cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by both the Fifth and Eighth Amendments,"" Roof's lawyers wrote in the 30-plus page motion.

Roof, who is white, is accused of killing black worshipers at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina in June 2015. The Justice Department is seeking the death penalty against him, including hate crime charges for allegedly targeting his victims on the basis of their race and religion.

The defense in this capital punishment case cited ""the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,"" in their motion, and said that if, as they argue, the death penalty is unconstitutional, ""no one can be lawfully sentenced to death or executed under it, no matter what his crimes.""

Roof's defense was careful to note that their challenge stemmed from the prosecution's refusal to accept their client's guilty pleas, despite his willingness to accept multiple life sentences without the possibility for parole. The motion states that if the prosecution drops the death penalty, Roof's attorneys would ""withdraw this motion and plead guilty as charged to all counts in the indictment.""

Last year a federal grand jury in South Carolina indicted Roof on 33 counts of federal hate crimes and firearm charges.

U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said during a press conference in July 2015 that Roof, now 22, planned to kill blacks in Church to spark racial animosity nationwide.

""To carry out these twin goals of fanning racial flames and exacting revenge, Roof further decided to seek out and murder African Americans because of their race,"" Lynch said. ""An essential element of his plan, however, was to find his victims inside of a church, specifically an African-American church, to ensure the greatest notoriety and attention to his actions.""",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/law-enforcement-calling-dallas-gunman-terrorist/story?id=40488653,"As details emerge about Dallas gunman Micah Johnson's life before he went on a deadly rampage that left five police officers dead last week, a narrative has emerged: Johnson was no terrorist.

Alleged evidence points to a troubled man who had an affinity for black nationalist power, according to some experts, who have suggested Johnson’s violent actions could point to the extremist, fanatic behavior typically associated with terrorists.

But the words “terrorism” and “terrorist” have largely remained absent from discourse following the deadly shooting last Thursday.

According to law enforcement, Johnson was heavily researching black history and heritage; he reportedly “liked” and supported the New Black Panther Party and the African American Defense League on Facebook, both of which have been deemed as hate groups; he had enough bomb-making materials in his home to lead authorities to believe he was planning a larger attack; he was filled with rage over two recent fatal police shootings of black men.

However, authorities and the Obama administration have so far refused to call Johnson a “terrorist.""

Laura Buckman/AFP/Getty Images

Terrorism, a Tricky Word

Words have multiple meanings, and their meanings are always in flux, said Robin Lakoff, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Terrorism is a word that we as a society are currently struggling with,” Lakoff said in an interview with ABC News. “What do we want it to apply to today? How do recent events make us rethink how we want to use it? There is no single simple answer. Americans will have to duke it out over time.”

Despite the Dallas shooter’s apparent hatred of white people and his alleged ties to black-power groups, Lakoff doesn’t believe his behavior qualified as terrorism.

“I see Johnson's behavior as driven not by political scheming but out of some kind of individual, psychotic rage, not even necessarily having a plan, just needing to kill and settling on a convenient target,” she said.

In a tense standoff with police last week, Johnson claimed he was acting alone and was not affiliated with any specific group.

Terrorism’s most widely accepted definition is the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. According to Lakoff, it’s also the intention of creating in a society a climate of fear, chaos, inaction and despair, leading ultimately to social and political disorganization.

“In the case of terrorism, the physical violent actions are not the point in themselves,” Lakoff said. “They are done for a deeper and more dangerous cause, and the actual victims themselves are merely peripheral damage, side effects.”

Lakoff said she believes the “terrorism label” is applied too often, and sometimes too hastily, including potentially for recent Orlando shooter Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people last month in a popular gay nightclub. He called 911 during the rampage and claimed allegiance to ISIS.

Lakoff said she doesn’t believe Mateen’s actions necessarily fell within the strict definition of terrorism that did apply to the events of 9/11, or to the attacks in Paris or Brussels this past year.

“I just see some ambiguity,” Lakoff said.

Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, agreed, telling ABC News that to be designated as a terrorist, it depends largely on the motivations.

In Mateen’s case, Patel said, there was considerable debate over his motivations in committing his crime. If he was acting to support a group like ISIS or al-Qaeda, then his acts would qualify as terrorism. However, if he was a repressed gay man, as some reports have suggested, the story would be different.

“Of course, the question was moot since he wasn't alive to face charges,” Patel said.

In contrast, Patel brings up the case of Dylann Roof, a white male who last year allegedly shot and killed nine African-American members of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in hopes of igniting a race war.

“Dylann Roof could not technically be charged with terrorism, even though he appears to have racist motives, because there was no link to a foreign terrorist group,” Patel said. “Of course, he was charged with 33 criminal acts, including hate crimes and firearm violations, for his killing spree in Charleston.”

But what defines terrorism and whether it applies to certain individuals is only half the issue, Patel said. The “broader issue,” Patel said, is what “public officials describe as terrorism.”

Violence Committed by Muslims, Always an Act of Terrorism?

There is a tendency to jump to the “terrorism label” when a Muslim commits an act of violence, an assumption that Muslims are “only motivated by some twisted interpretation of Islam rather than a host of personal and social factors,” according to Patel.

The result of applying the “terrorism label” so quickly has several negative consequences, Patel said.

“Because Muslim violence is described as part of a broader ideological frame, it both heightens the perception of the threat ‘Islam is waging a war against the West’ and makes it easier to place blame on all Muslims. In contrast, non-Muslim shooters are more often described as individuals with mental or social problems not part of some broader movement, although their beliefs too are often explored in the press,” she said.

Patel said it’s a tendency that can “allow us to dismiss someone like Dylann Roof as crazy and avoid uncomfortable questions about the extent of organized racism and far-right violence in our society or about our lax gun laws.”

It’s a label that isn’t really fair to Muslims, Lakoff said.

“I am afraid that a Muslim name makes it much easier for Americans to apply the label ‘terrorism’ to violent actions. But needless to say, Muslims are just like everyone else. They have all kinds of reasons for what they do. Terrorism is one; but we should try to remember that terrorism was not invented by Muslims,” Lakoff said. “We are much too likely to think of Muslims as prototypical ‘terrorists’ while homegrown Christian types who misbehave in analogous ways are just individuals not acting out of political motives. Wrong, of course.”

The solution to combating a hasty “terrorism label” is to actually get away from using the label, Patel said.

“In my view, the solution isn't to call more things terrorism, but to get away from the politics of that label. We should evaluate, and respond to threats based on actual attacks, capacity and seriousness of intent,” Patel said. “Not on perceptions about a particular religion or racial or ethnic group.”",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/obama-suggestions-enormous-polarization-us-true/story?id=40440151,"President Obama today sought to ease concerns over recent turmoil in the United States, saying suggestions of enormous polarization are ""just not true.""

""You’re not seeing riots and you're not seeing police going after people who are protesting peacefully,"" Obama said at the top of a news conference at the NATO Summit. ""As tough as hard as depressing the loss of life was this week, we’ve got a foundation to build on.""

Since his arrival in Warsaw Friday, Obama has been forced to juggle high tensions over two police-involved shootings in Baton Rouge and Minneapolis, as well as the brutal sniper attack in Dallas Thursday night that left five police officers dead with international issues such as the uncertainty in the global economy triggered by the United Kingdom's vote to leave the EU and ongoing concerns about terrorism.

The White House announced Friday that he would cut his weekend trip to Spain short and visit Dallas sometime early next week at the invitation of the city's mayor.

Speaking without notes, in front of a standing-room-only hall packed with international press, he delivered a message of an America united in condemnation of the attack on police in Dallas, as well as the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Sterling, both of whom were shot by police in separate incidents.

""We just have to have confidence that we can build on those better angels of our nature,"" Obama said. ""We have to make sure that all of us step back, do some reflection and make sure the rhetoric that we engage in is constructive and not destructive.""

Obama urged Americans to separate the actions of the Dallas shooter from peaceful activists who are concerned about recent police shootings.

He then praised the ""overwhelming majority of Americans"" who he said ""have reacted with empathy and understanding"" to the past week.

The president stopped short of labeling the shooting in Dallas as a hate crime or domestic terrorism, saying ""it's very hard to untangle the motives of this shooter.""

""I'll leave that to psychologists and people who study these kinds of incidents,"" Obama said. ""I think the danger is that we somehow suggest the act of a troubled individuals speaks to some larger political statement across the country.""

And despite some criticism of his initial reaction to the attack, the president doubled down on his statement injecting gun control into the debate over the deadly attack as well as the deaths in Minneapolis and Baton Rouge.

""If you care about safety of our police officers, you can't set aside the gun issue and pretend that that's irrelevant,"" Obama said. ""Part of what's creating tensions between communities and police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere.""

He made a comparison between the level of gun violence in the U.S. as opposed to that in countries that have more stringent guns laws in many countries, particularly among NATO members.

""If you look at the pattern of death and violence and shootings that we have experienced over the course of the last year, or ten years, we are unique among advanced countries in the scale of violence we experience,"" he said.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/suspected-gang-members-firebombed-homes-drive-black-residents/story?id=40416284,"On Mother’s Day two years ago, suspected members of the street gang “Big Hazard” gathered in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles to prepare for an attack, federal prosecutors allege.

When they met, they distributed disguises, gloves and other materials, according to an indictment unsealed Thursday. The group then split up, broke victims’ windows and threw Molotov cocktails into their homes.

The target was African-American families, and the goal was to drive them from the Ramona Gardens Housing Development (RGHD), according to officials.

Seven men were charged in connection to these crimes in the 10-count federal indictment.

In one of the attacks, a firebomb landed on the couch where an African-American woman and her baby had been sleeping.

“This is a hate crime. Such violence and intimidation have no place in our society,” said Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, in a statement.

Carlos Hernandez, aka “Creeper and Rider”, 31, who is accused of organizing the attack, was charged, along with six other men, ages 21-25, with conspiracy to violate civil rights, conspiracy to use fire and carry explosives to commit another federal felony, attempted arson of federal property and other charges.

Hernandez allegedly told the defendants during the meeting before the attacks that the purpose of the firebombing was to “get the n------ out of the neighborhood,” or words to that effect, according to the indictment.

Most of the victims of the firebombing were African-American families who were at home with their children, according to investigators.

As of June 2016, Ramona Gardens was occupied by approximately 95 percent Hispanic residents and approximately 3 percent African-American residents, according to court documents.

This crime was “particularly disturbing” because the targets of the firebombing included children, said U.S. Attorney Eileen M. Decker of the Central District of California.

“Crimes targeting innocent people based on the color of their skin are among the most heinous crimes a community can suffer,” she said in a statement.

In addition to the firebombing, the suspected gang members allegedly spray-painted their gang monikers and gang symbols on businesses, residences and property to instill fear and mark their territory, according to the indictment.

This two-year long investigation resulted in one of the largest civil rights indictments in local history, according to Assistant Director in Charge Deirdre Fike of the FBI’s Los Angeles Division.

The Hazard gang, which gets its name from a neighborhood park, had an estimated membership of approximately 350 individuals as of June 2016, according to the indictment.

The defendants were also charged with violent crime in aid of racketeering and interference with housing rights, among other charges.

Attorney information for Hernandez and the other defendants was not immediately available. It is unclear whether they have entered pleas to the charges against them.

If convicted of all counts, four of the men face a maximum sentence of 110 years in prison and one faces 115 year maximum. according to a press release from the Department of Justice. Two of the suspected gang members would face life sentences.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/International/wave-anti-immigrant-hate-crimes-uk-prompts-increased/story?id=40222014,"U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron announced a plan to “drive appalling hate crimes” out of Britain in the wake of a spike in anti-immigrant sentiment that has rocked the country in the wake of last week's Brexit vote.

Cameron announced to Parliament today that additional funding for security measures would be provided in response to combat attacks against migrants workers. He urged all Members of Parliament to condemn such attacks, regardless of party affiliation.

Hate crimes rose 57 percent between last Thursday and Sunday in the U.K. compared to the same time frame last month, according to the National Police Chiefs' Council, an organization representing British police chiefs.

ABC News reported Tuesday on a video of a racist tirade that occurred on a Manchester tram that went viral in the U.K. because of the degree to which it captured the atmosphere of tension in the country, following the country's decision to leave the European Union last week.

The victim of the attack, Juan Jasso, is actually a Mexican-American who supports the Brexit vote, the New York Times reported today.

And there are reports of other hate crimes in Britain.

Today, a man was arrested for posting extreme right-wing material online that was Islamophobic and anti-Semitic in nature, according to a report in the Telegraph.

And the U.K. paper the Evening Standard reported that an 8-year-old Polish girl was told to ""f--- off back to Poland"" by classmates three days after the vote, and people were using car keys to etch images of penises and swastikas onto the bodies of German cars that were parked near the Polish Social and Cultural Association building in Hammersmith, a district in west London.

The video captures the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty in the U.K. in the wake of the so-called Brexit vote, as hate crimes are said to have spiked across the country, targeting mostly immigrants and British-born citizens of foreign heritage. Yesterday the National Police Chiefs' Council, an organization representing British police chiefs, announced that hate crimes in the U.K. from last Thursday to Sunday were up 57 percent compared with the same period last month.

Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim to serve as mayor of London, is a former human rights lawyer and the son of a bus driver from Pakistan. He has asked the police to be ""vigilant"" in preventing the further spread of abuse.

""It's important we stand guard against any rise in hate crimes or abuse by those who might use last week's referendum as cover to seek to divide us,"" he told the press. ""I've asked our police to be extra vigilant for any rise in cases of hate crime, and I'm calling on all Londoners to pull together and rally behind this great city.""

Some analysts believe that a backlash against immigrants may have played a role in the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU.

Social media continues to buzz with reports of incidents against immigrants, including natural-born English residents of South Asian descent.

The Muslim Council of Britain — which represents 500 mosques, schools and associations — said in a statement on its website that ""over 100 hate incidents"" have taken place as a result of the Brexit vote.

His speech followed what has been a tumultuous series of days for Britain and was intended in part to reassure investors in the economic stability of the U.K. as markets continued to tumble around the globe in reaction to the vote on a Brexit, or Britain's withdrawal from the E.U.

The latest sign of the Brexit backlash was the announcement today from credit rating agency Standard & Poor's that it was downgrading its rating on the U.K. from AAA to AA.

""In our opinion, this outcome is a seminal event, and will lead to a less predictable, stable, and effective policy framework in the U.K.,"" S&P said.

Fitch Ratings also cut its forecast of the U.K.'s sovereign rating one notch to AA from AA+ and said its outlook on the region was negative.

Cameron opened his speech by acknowledging that ""adjustments with [Britain's] economy would have to be made"" but said that ""the decision must be accepted.""

He said he would not be triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins the process of withdrawal from the EU. That will be left to his successor in October.

Cameron pledged to resign from his post after voters decided last week to leave the EU. He campaigned aggressively for Britain to remain in Europe after making the controversial decision to hold Thursday's referendum.

U.K.'s Treasury Chief George Osborne sought to ease the global markets after the historic vote, saying the U.K. economy is firmly positioned to face the challenges ahead.

""Today I want to reassure the British people and the global community that Britain is ready to confront what the future holds for us from a position of strength,"" he said during a news conference this morning.

In his first public appearance since Thursday's referendum, Osborne stressed that Britain's economy is in a far better position than it was at the start of the 2008 financial crisis.

""Growth has been robust. Employment rate is at a record high. The capital requirements for banks are 10 times what they were, and the budget deficit has been brought down from 11 percent of our national income and was forecast to be below 3 percent this year,"" he said. ""I said we had to fix the roof so that we were prepared for whatever the future held, and thank goodness we did. As a result, our economy is about as strong as it could be to confront the challenge our country now faces.""

But his remarks were not enough to ease investors' concerns.

The British pound dropped to its lowest level in 30 years Friday and fell an additional 2 percent against the U.S. dollar before Osborne's comments. The pound rebounded slightly after the speech.

Friday's selloff wiped out $2.1 trillion in global markets, with the United States alone losing $830 billion.

U.S. markets continued their decline this morning.

During an appearance on ABC's ""This Week,"" Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the United States, said that the U.K.'s position after the vote would not mean the nation is ""disappearing from the world stage"" and that it would remain ""America's closest ally.""

""There's going to be a period of uncertainty while we work out this new relationship with Europe,"" he said. ""But we are a strong country, a stable country. We will work it out in our usual pragmatic way. We will come through this, and we will end up as important a player on the international scene as we have been.""

The final tally in the Brexit referendum was 51.9 percent in favor of leaving to 48.1 percent for remaining — leaving many questioning the finality of the decision. By midday Sunday, more than 3 million people had signed an online petition asking for a new referendum. Darroch, however, described the Brexit decision as ""irrevocable.""

Tim Ireland/AP

He said the ""expectation"" is that the ruling Conservative Party will elect a new leader by the end of September.

""The prime minister made it clear throughout that this was a once-in-a-generation vote and the result was final,"" Darroch said. ""The task for us now is to pull together and work out the new relationship with Europe.""

Meanwhile, the opposition Labour Party is also experiencing fallout over the EU referendum, as party leader Jeremy Corbyn continues to weather calls for his resignation. Today he announced new team members after 12 members of his shadow cabinet resigned on Sunday. He has mostly struck a tone of defiance in the face of criticism. On Saturday he tweeted that he was ""elected Labour's Leader to redistribute power and wealth in this country.""

Cameron also used his speech to address concerns that hate crimes had escalated in the wake of the Brexit vote. The referendum was largely seen as a reaction to a wave of populist, anti-immigration sentiment growing in the British electorate.

As deputies -- who assisted with evacuations and held a perimeter until Orlando PD SWAT arrive -- got to the scene in the early morning hours of June 12, they were told that it was an ""active shooter"" situation and that there were ""multiple victims"" in the area who were ""seriously injured with gunshot wounds,"" according to the report.

As soon as one deputy approached the scene, the first thing he saw was EMS tending to victims.

""The scene was chaotic as many of the victims had gunshot wounds and some who had been carried over appeared to be dead,"" the officer wrote in the incident report.

The officer was tasked with crowd control, he said, as several of the victims and witnesses were ""hysterical."" Victims who were fatally and critically wounded were being placed behind a nearby bagel shop and the wounded who were able to walk were placed in the parking lot.

A deputy who was positioned on the south entrance of the club saw three to four deceased victims in the parking lot, as well as several people exiting the building, the report said. When he saw a woman who was shot, he assisted an Orlando Police Department officer in moving her away from the building, he said. He then saw a second woman who had been shot and attempted to ask her about what she witnessed, but she did not have any information to provide, the officer reported. He then heard ""numerous sounds of gunfire"" inside.

While taking cover on the east side of the building just outside of the patio, one deputy described covering the other officers as they extracted injured victims from inside the club.

Another deputy described hearing shots fired as he approached the club on foot and seeing people covered in blood running out of the building and several more in the parking lot who suffered from gunshot wounds. That officer assisted in carrying the injured people to vehicles to be taken to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, the report stated.

A deputy who helped carry a man who appeared to have gunshot wounds to his right forearm and left shin remembered exactly what he was wearing: a black T-shirt and blue jeans. The officer then responded to the hospital after reports of shots fired there. When he arrived, he was advised by security that shots hadn't been fired and he positioned himself in the emergency room to assist with the hospital's lockdown protocol.

Omar Mateen opened fire on the Pulse nightclub, a popular spot for the LGBT community, on June 12 and pledged allegiance to ISIS during a 911 call. He was killed in a gun battle with cops.

There will be extra police officers at the Chicago pride festival this weekend, the CPD told ABC News, while officers in New York City have increased their presence all week.

Security is also a priority at clubs closer to the scene of the Sunday shooting that resulted in 50 deaths at Pulse nightclub.

At Southern Nights, another LGBT club in Orlando, management has implemented new security measures that include two police officers with their cars positioned in front of the club every night, a private security company hired to handle metal detectors, wands and pat downs, and a ban on bringing any bags into the club.

""Southern Nights has been a home to the LGBT Community for 40 years,” the club said on its Facebook post. “It is, and will continue to be a place for all people to feel comfortable and always welcome. We promise that we will do everything in our power to keep it this way.”

While Orlando is reeling from what the FBI has now ruled a hate crime and the largest mass shooting in recent U.S. history, there have been other incidents at gay bars in New York where references were made to Orlando.

""In New York City, we responded to two incidents of violence where LGBT bars were targeted and references to Orlando were made,"" said Shelby Chestnut, director of community organizing and public advocacy at the New York City Anti-Violence Project.

She also noted that there was more than one instance where people reportedly found handwritten notes on their cars that featured ""threatening language and threats targeting LGBT people.""

Earlier in the week, there was a vigil at the Stonewall Inn, a gay landmark bar in the Greenwich Village, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said there would be increased security at that club and any other events at ""key LGBT community locations.""

""I think there is a lot of fear in the [LGBT] community here in NYC and around the country,"" de Blasio told ABC News Radio affiliate 1010 WINS earlier this week.

""There will be lots of additional police presence at all these events, particularly presence of our new critical response command, which is the largest anti-terror force of any police force in the country. So you will see the NYPD out in force keeping us safe,"" he said.

No specific numbers on police presence in New York have been released, but NYPD Chief of Department James O’Neill reiterated that they will be prepared for crowds at LGBT bars this weekend.

""Security is being stepped up, in particular, to areas where there is nightlife, anywhere where there are crowds, working closely with LGBT community,"" O'Neill said on 1010 WINS.

""I think it’s important that people have a chance to grieve, especially in public, and we will provide security for those events.”

'A Hate Crime' and 'Act of Terror'

FBI officials Wednesday called the massacre that left 50 dead, including the shooter, at the nightclub both an act of terrorism and a hate crime.

Investigators are still piecing together possible motives for the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, with the focusing recently turning toward the shooter's wife, Noor Mateen, whom the FBI is still investigating, though no charges have been filed.

Omar Mateen's background

New details have begun to emerge about Omar Mateen. When he was a freshman in high school, Mateen was sent to an alternative school after he got into a fight with a fellow student, he wrote in a questionnaire for the Indian River State College Criminal Justice Training, which he filled out on Nov. 19, 2014. It is unclear what the fight was about. In his employment history, Mateen, who said he had a degree in criminal justice from Indian River State College, wrote that he had worked at the Marin Correctional Institution in Indiantown, Florida as a correctional officer trainee from October 2006 to April 2007, and cited the reason for leaving as ""probationary dismissal.""

On the questionnaire, Mateen said that in 2006, he was on a ""ridealong"" with a police deputy in St. Lucie when the patrol car hydroplaned and ""got wrapped around a tree."" In a portion of the questionnaire dealing with drug usage, Mateen answered ""yes"" to having used cannabis or marijuana and steroids. He wrote that he did not drink alcohol, the documents say.

Myspace

Mateen checked ""yes"" to a question that asked whether he had ""ever been arrested, charged or received a notice or summons to appear, convicted, pled nolo contendere or pled guilty for any criminal violation or detained by ANY law enforcement agency.""

There was no further explanation on the form.

Mateen also checked ""yes"" to a question asking if he had ever committed or been involved in an undetected crime of any type, such as drinking, petit theft, shoplifting or stealing from an employer. Again, there was no further explanation.

Mateen said he had some sort of criminal record sealed or expunged, but no explanation was provided as to what the record was.

Threats?

Mateen apparently made a series of Facebook posts and searches before and during his attack on the LGBT nightclub, raging against the ""filthy ways of the west"" and blaming the United States for the deaths of ""innocent women and children,"" according to a Senate committee.

The Senate Homeland Security Committee sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, asking the company to produce information on Mateen's online activity and to provide a briefing to the panel.

Senators asked for a briefing and material to be provided by Facebook to the committee by June 29.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/investigators-turn-focus-omar-mateens-wife-criminal-charges/story?id=39867320,"FBI officials Wednesday called the massacre that left 50 dead, including the shooter, at an Orlando gay nightclub both an act of terrorism and a hate crime.

As investigators piece together possible motives for the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, the focus has turned toward the shooter's wife.

What Did She Know?

Noor Mateen, the 30-year-old wife of Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen, is being considered for possible criminal charges, officials say.

A law enforcement official told ABC News that she may have known something about the assault in advance but claims she tried to talk him out of it.

Myspace

Noor Mateen was with her husband when he recently bought ammunition and a holster, sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News.

Authorities said that she was not initially forthcoming with investigators but began to open up and cooperate after pressure from investigators. Omar Mateen and Noor Mateen were married for about 3 1/2 years, his father, Seddique Mateen, told ABC News. He said he had no idea whether she was involved in the attack.

No final decision has been made about whether to charge Noor Mateen, according to the sources.

Pledges to ISIS

While inside of Pulse, after an initial round of shooting, Omar Mateen called not only 911 but also someone he knew. He also called an Orlando television station.

Matt Gentili, a producer at CFN 13 in Orlando, told the AP that a man called him and said ""I'm the shooter. It's me. I am the shooter.""

Gentili said that Mateen said that he did it for the Islamic State and spoke in Arabic.

The call came in about 2:45 a.m., roughly 45 minutes into the massacre, NY 1 News, the station's sister operation in New York, told the AP.

During Mateen's call to police and in a Facebook post, he also pledged allegiance to ISIS. On Facebook, he also ordered America and Russia to “stop bombing” the terror group and warned of attacks to come, FBI officials said.

Omar Mateen's Sexuality Questioned

Seddique Mateen told ABC News that she and his son were close, had a good marriage, shared everything and lived together.

He also said he didn't think his son was gay.

He said that if his son was gay, his wife would know and that if he was using gay dating apps or going to gay clubs, it is likely he was scouting a location for an attack.

ABC News

Employees and patrons of Pulse nightclub, the site of the shooting, told ABC News that Omar Mateen was a regular at the club for several years. James Van Horn, a Pulse patron, told ABC News ""the shooter used to come into the bar on a regular basis. Sometimes he would be there for a few weeks at a time and maybe on the weekends.""

FBI agents heard accounts that Mateen used gay dating apps to make contact with men.

Myspace

""When he first contacted me, he was saying, like, asking what clubs, in his words, what clubs are popping and things of that sort and what are good places are to go,"" Kevin West said to ABC Houston station KTRK-TV.

At a press conference today, officials offered little in the way of new details about the ongoing investigation, and asked for patience.

FBI Special Agent Ron Hopper, who is in charge of the investigation, categorized the shooting as being both a hate crime and an act of terrorism.

""It's both,"" he said.

The FBI published a poster today seeking information from anyone who had contact with Mateen.

Survivors Speak Out

Victims of the shooting recounted the moment the gunman burst into the club and started shooting.

Angel Colon told reporters he was at Pulse early Sunday morning saying goodbye to friends when Mateen burst in and opened fire.

""Out of nowhere, we hear a big shot, and then we stop what we're doing, and it keeps going,"" Colon told reporters Tuesday at the Orlando Regional Medical Center.

He was shot three times in the leg and was trampled as he lay on the floor, he said.

""I tried to get back up, but everyone started running everywhere, and I got trampled over,"" Colon said. ""I shattered and broke my bones on my left leg.""

Speaking from his hospital bed, Colon told ABC News about an officer who he says helped him escape while the killer was engaged in a gun battle with police.

""The only way I can get you out of here is if I just grab your hands and I run,"" the officer said, according to Colon.

Colon asked to be carried and the officer told him that it wasn't possible, and that they would be forced to run.

""Let's go,"" Colon said he told the officer.

The officer then grabbed him and dragged him across the broken glass. Colon was wearing shorts at the time, he said, and received cuts up and down his body. Due to the heroic efforts of the officer, Colon said, he was out of Pulse roughly 25 minutes after the shooting erupted.

A Philadelphia woman recounted the frightening hours she spent locked in a bathroom with the gunman at Pulse.

Patience Carter, 20, said she was at the club with two friends during a family vacation to Orlando when the gunman ran in and started shooting.

Carter said she and one of her friends ran outside and initially escaped the area but soon realized their other friend was missing. They went back for their friend and ended up being trapped in a bathroom as the gunman got closer, she said.

""We just went from having the time of our lives to having the worst night of our lives,"" she told reporters today during a news conference at Florida Hospital in Orlando.

Carter described the terrifying moments when Mateen entered the bathroom and started shooting, leaving people injured on the floor. She said that at first she thought he had a BB gun but then realized she was being hit with particles from a wall that was coming apart from the force of assault rifle bullets.

After she and her two friends were shot, they remained trapped with the gunman for hours, she said. She had a shattered right femur and another shot in her left thigh.

""I was begging God to please take me ... to take the soul out of my body because I didn't want to feel any more pain,"" she said.

Of the 44 patients taken to hospitals after the shooting, 22 are still admitted, with four in critical condition, according to hospital officials.

The Orange County Medical Examiner's Office said Tuesday evening that 20 of the 49 killed clubgoers have been released to funeral homes.

Communities Grieving yet Resilient

Thousands of people gathered Tuesday evening in several venues across the city to mourn those lost in Sunday's massacre.

A bell chimed as each of the 49 names of the deceased were read at a vigil at the First Baptist Church of Orlando.

More than 2,500 people sang, prayed and held hands during the vigil.

Some were visibly emotional as the names of the dead were read. One man told ABC News that hearing the chimes felt like ""blood calling out for vengeance.""

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/orlando-massacre-touches-off-renewed-gun-control-debate/story?id=39815454,"Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office Monday in the wake of the Orlando massacre, President Obama expressed frustration over what he said was the ease with which known or suspected terrorists are able to buy guns legally in the United States.

“If we have self-radicalized individuals in this country, then they are going to be very difficult oftentimes to find ahead of time, and how easy it is for them to obtain weapons is in some cases going to make a difference as to whether they're able to carry out attacks like this or not,” he said.

Now leading Democrats are seeking to revive a measure that they say could have at least potentially stopped Orlando shooter Omar Mateen from buying firearms. The bill, drafted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, would have blocked people who are “known or appropriately suspected” to be engaged in terrorism from being able to buy guns.

The bill to close the so-called “terror gap” failed in the Senate, 45-54 during a vote last December. It would have essentially added a tenth criterion to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ list of prohibited gun purchasers, which currently includes convicts, fugitives from justice, people convicted of domestic violence and illegal aliens.

The measure would potentially give the federal government the authority to block someone like Mateen, who the FBI had questioned on suspicion of terrorist activity, even though he was not on a terrorist watch list or a no-fly list.

The FBI closed an investigation into Mateen in 2013 and moved on after questioning him again in 2014. He purchased the two guns used in the massacre -- an AR-style rifle and Glock 17 handgun -- legally just days before the shooting.

“If the FBI did not have to close those cases, could make a notation, then when that fella went in, last week, to purchase an AR-15 and an automatic handgun, he would have come up on their radar scope,” Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) said on a conference call with reporters Monday.

But the Feinstein camp cautioned that it was unclear if Mateen would have met the standard proposed by the legislation at the time he bought the weapons.

Sen. Bob Casey also introduced a new bill Monday that would prohibit the purchase of guns by anyone who committed or is “reasonably suspected to be guilty of” a misdemeanor hate crime.

While Democrats said the Feinstein bill would have been the most effective in preventing a lone wolf like Mateen from purchasing guns and will thus remain their legislative priority, they also listed several other failed measures that they want to try to pass again.

Those include an assault weapons ban, expanded background checks to include gun shows and all Internet sales, and the criminalization of straw purchasing and gun trafficking.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn also introduced in 2015 a counterproposal to Feinstein’s bill which would have allowed the attorney general to delay a suspected terrorist trying to get a gun for 72 hours, and require court approval to block the sale. That amendment, which was voted on at the same time as Feinstein’s, also failed, 55-44.

President Obama himself has tried repeatedly to usher gun safety legislation through Congress, most notably when, after the Sandy Hook massacre of 2012, the White House worked on a sweeping, 23-part plan, most of which required Congressional approval.

The most notable part of that plan was a mandate for background checks on most gun sales. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) crafted such a bill, but it failed 54 to 46 in April 2013.

Citing frustration with his legislative defeats, the president then shifted his focus to actions he could accomplish without Congress’ approval.

In January of this year he unveiled a new strategy that did not issue any new regulations or executive orders, but rather “make it clear” that gun sellers must get licenses and conduct background checks, whether in stores, online or at gun shows.

“It doesn’t matter whether you’re doing it over the Internet or at a gun show. It’s not where you do it, but what you do,” Obama said during a speech unveiling the proposals.

The White House also proposed increased funding for access to mental health care and for an additional 200 new ATF agents and investigators to help enforce gun laws on the books. The Senate is currently working on a bipartisan mental health bill, but it’s not clear if and when it will get a vote.

A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who controls which measures get Senate votes, said he did not have any updates on gun safety amendments or if/when they might come to the floor.",abcnews.com,True

Hello and welcome to the do you you've probably heard the headlines hundreds of times by now its worst mass shooting in American history. And happen in Orlando Florida yesterday and here with the very latest on what's going on please welcome ABC news man Brian Ross Brian. This. What is going on what's happened it. This is a horrible thing crime of terror act of hate. Both in this nightclub which was refuge a place of safety for the gay community in Orlando. Reporter but what do we what is the authorities know about this the perpetrate their arm his name is up Omar act. Omar 1929. Years old born here in New York went to high school. In Florida his parents are from Afghanistan he worked for the last nine years as a security guard but long before the attack yesterday. He was known by friends by his ex wife is somebody who was violent. At a short temper. And was homophobic didn't the wife divorce and the first wife because he abused tack he'd already heard he's set on a regular basis she told us that she was lucky to get out of that marriage a lot from the way that he treated her. She described the situation the man who loved police wanted to be a policeman. And also could not stand the presence of people who were gay but. Dot also she also said that he was mentally ill. If we can't take that you know the father came out video and said some things but it's been speculated that he went to this gate club because he saw two men kissing prior to. Came here and retaliated. I consider this a hate crime. Then a terrorist act then. Horrible news to America in general but this hate crime how come. How other people are making at other things before it needs to be categorized as hate crime. First literally was an act of hate but we also know that during the siege. There was appear when he went in any opened fired probably kill most the people that. And then for three hours held hostages in a bathroom. Four of five hostages there were fifteen other hostages held in another bathroom during the three hour period before police finally moved in. He made several calls to 91 want to talk to police and essentially pledged his allegiance to ices which is why we get a connection to a terror attack. Can you talk about hate to but that connection to ice is that this is a group that. Brutalize its gaze they're known to do some horrific things to the gay community in fact they've bragged about the persecution of the gay community do they not. Only that they they put videos online showing the execution of a gay man in Iraq and Syria they've been stoned and that they've been thrown off high buildings. And they provide a twisted version of three law. They wish they justified the murder the killing of anyone who's gay because according to them that's the worst in that could possibly be of Gottesman. Kind. A lot of people are wondering how to how to market he slipped through the cracks because he was on the watch list of the FBI they spoke with him three times. And here he goes last week and applies for it AR fifteen. He gets a blocked his style slides right through the FBI background check no flag that the FBI counterterrorism. Unit. Has thirty spoken with a guy. They know him well they've interviewed him three times he was twice under investigation 2013. And 2014. Because of possible connections to known terrorists. He was interviewed by the FBI counter terror agents they concluded the connections he had where varies tangential. Not that important and he says he was dismissed as somebody who was not really a threat. That did not stop and anyway the fact that he could go into a gun store and buy weapons. That's that's the outrage. Outrage tonight and here's something else that's going on I don't know if this is a copy cat I don't know if he's connected to terror as well but we can go across the country. Because yesterday authorities detained a man with assault weapons near a gay pride festival. Should we connected to should lease cheek in this separate. Would he think. They are connected in terms of they coordinated their it had actions that there's a man in west of Iraq's actually rest in Santa Monica. But said he was going to the gay pride festival in West Hollywood. He was stopped their questioning him they're not sure what his intentions were but it sounds like very serious issue. Bullet could be it could be both homophobia and also terrorism of the upscale that would talk about it guys. We are killing American American amazed so let's. Americans first I think that's something this is an American problem. Not just in LG BT community and I think that it can't scare us from going out and and living our lives but we also have to watch out for each other and and you know raise the red flags and wonder what about survivors. Do we know anything about what they're telling authorities. We'll talk about the ordeal some played dead lying on the floor of that night clubs. The one described being folks by the gunman who just plain dead. Some of them barely got out most of them were able to escape. And the police chief they're described this morning how in the final moments. They decided to go in through the walls and they set off an explosive charge. It didn't quite take down the wall they drove an armored truck through the wall created this opening. And about fifteen or sixteen hostages escaped and ran out and then the gunman himself came out. And that's when the final gun fight took place that killed him. I'm asking you talk just a second ago read about the copycats Brian but. We know that he was on the phone with tightness are anti on the phone with 911 has claimed that he was pledging his allegiance nice as but. Crisis is owned radio bulletins and called Omar Mateen quote one of the soldiers of the Khaled feet in America and we know that these loans wolves attack. Are we at risk because this seems to be the new norm they don't want any communication crisis as money can any communication. They want these guys to work his lone wolf so our immediate risk from further attacks like this. We'll certainly vices sends out the word to Americans especially to act in their own country to attack here in any way they can't. They've sent a message of hate about gays that's in the most of hate about American military American police they sent a lot of hate us. And also they've been the guy that was in that was found in Los Angeles had quite a quite a few guns and his. Car and explosives as well so. Is it something that we need to remind people that as Americans. Gay straight yellow orange whatever that we actually have to. Now take a look and make sure that we're paying attention we'll. But frankly we are all targets. A vices from the point of you vices he and first and foremost in America. They like to kill Americans in the good yeah who whatever their gender whatever and sexual preference and whatever the religion black. Do think that the NRA a crisis or on a collision course at the moment. Hard to say in this case he bought his guns legally. As we've seen their support their problem with the system but even though he had been under investigation by the FBI counter terror squads. He was able to buy these guns he went through a three day background Santa. Now that has uncensored news everything the only and that's why I want loan works that's what they once again get there yet they take advantage of and let us not forget that this this is also hate crime. It's both and and yes but it's also because that sometimes when you hear is terrorism we sort of Sal and that's that's not ask for this this affects. Who you wanna be is an America. You're looked very time in the acts as the gay community yes without a doubt and we and between Los Angeles. And here I'm sign and panel Alando.

So many people outside of our community much better than other people outside of our community has embraced us. And Britain should show that everyone needs to sit together at all times no matter which you go home with no matter where you go to work no matter what be have to just keep these conversations like. Sapp had a conversation and come up with a plan to fix it we got guys I'm soaking if you still have discovered Seychelles as any day. Tuesday you know one of the arguments they cared about more guns more God's my guns which is from by the way said that. He would absolutely wouldn't ban assault weapons because quote unquote people need protection well. And everything he said when with a buck bucks o'clock in France from when that happened. And he says they had guns this they would have been able to defend himself will in fact there was a security guard outside of the pulse. This weekend who haven't gotten. They exchanged fire. And the guy went right past him with is assault weapons weapon and killed fifty people so here's the argument against that Donald that's the argument. Number two about this you can be on a not a no fly list in this country not be allowed to get on a plane because you but. If you're on that no fly list you can buy an assault rifle in this country what. He's got what is going interrogated by the FBI every time even added a guy but didn't know why does seems an open and shut case also did the list heroes and it's those people go in the computing you cannot quiet gotten. What is wrong with people in this country. Not more than 90% of Americans are an awful gun control Hillary Clinton has come out proposed reinstating the assault weapons ban. That expired in 204 under George W drive. American yeah actually have a choice in this election. You actually doubt you have power you have like a 133.

A piece takes maybe it's my age how adults don't eat they till they didn't tell. Why not about money it's it's about a lot of different things you know it's about a act an amendment of the constitution of people with street. The constitution doesn't say you can carry hundreds of guns it saves you cannot you can protect your home to do to protect itself it doesn't say get that the spot not that's not military style you know and and people's. Well we need to have our bands because we can you know those you can't hunt anything with an assault rifle yet and do what is nothing left as you. It's not. On to Wear that likely come after favre's back up. Because you can explain this now you can explain this away you can't explain it and sandy but it can't explain it here. There's no reason for anybody to have a machine got basically. To know that. Stuff you miss out I don't care what Tuesday backed off wound care anyway. You know a lot of people are upset that conservative politicians who is sending their thoughts and prayers this is what I think you're talking Madden. Acknowledging that this was a hate crime against LG BT community. I mean. Can they continue to ignore this what candidate do. I love that they're speaking out because I do you think there's any time were standing together it's good I do understand what rape is saying which now there needs to be some follow up anything that isn't the Larry appear to me. Is what makes us a great nation is that we separate church and speak and this is the only way we can co exist with differences of opinions lifestyles except her and the problem here is in the name of religion which has caused the worst for centuries. People become the judges themselves and kill that which is different I'm not. Out how to pay for. Especially those that make a lot in the name of their feet need to step back for a second I respect you for your belief. Let's remember that unless you keep that in homing in your family and where you can impressed that people aren't politics need to remain with out religion. I agree and I I think this is something that and you're talking about lobbyists politicians who happened to be Christian I think it's something the Christian community needs to do. A much better job. And that's loving people just because you love someone does a mean you have to totally agree with them the Bible says. Love god love people don't know your Christians by your love for one another and I think if anything I hope this situation I hope that it amplifies that and I hope that. If it brings our country together and and hopefully you know a lot of Christians and maybe those that that didn't I'm Steve side of the LG BT community.

Tim, I can't imagine how this has hit your community, how you all coming together dealing with it? Well, it's been obviously very tough, the organization that I lead is a community center, so, yesterday, we sprang into action getting counseling, grief counseling network set up, establishing a crisis hot line and starting to work with community members that just needed somewhere safe to be. So it's been rough. What do you want to say to the gay and lesbian community to Orlando. First of all, I want to say we are with you. We stand right next to you, support you and we'll do our best to protect you. You know, we are as Orlando community very shocked by what happened, the massacre yesterday morning, really was unimaginable. You know, over the years, our communities have been attacked by the same hate groups who would come in and protest at their center and then they come to our mosque and protest. So, we are two vulnerable communities that are under attack. And to have someone who claims to be Muslim go attack, you know, this community here is shocking. Claims to be a Muslim. Claims to be Muslim we say you can't be a Muslim if you have the heart to hurt a human being. And we condemn his actions, you know, on the strongest terms. What he did is a hate crime, is a criminal terrorist attack that we condemn as muslims in the strongest terms. Coming in the middle of gay pride month. You have seen these parades, celebrations across the country, but a lot of free now as well. Yes, you know, again, we saw lots of pictures coming from L.A. And different pride evens that were happening across the country, we received support from, you know, people around the world, even, and it's been super heartening to see, you know, out of this tragedy that there is a community that's pulling together and even more than that a world that's pulling together. Do you feel united in the face of this tragedy? We have worked on many times on many fronts united the interfaith community here is united behind the lgbt community and we are committed to our diversity as a community. The Muslim community, I spoke to leaders from New York to California yesterday, said we need to stand up together to express our solidarity with the lgbt community. We need to stand up against terrorism, loud and clear against the actions of Isis. And so, we're calling on a March in Washington next month, on July 23rd, right at the national mall, we're asking muslims, we're asking everybody to come out in the community to support and to speak that this tragedy will unite us not divide us. Thank you both for joining us

The mass shootings that our country has thing. Going through. I think as a nation we need to look at us. This is zero. Mass shootings because we just have one too many today. And I think we should know something about with the software that. Mass shootings that are happening. Gary okay. And here. Okay. Need. Early on we had up possible identification made three run everything the ground weathered winds up being actual individual or not. And so as I mentioned earlier this time I can't say exactly who the suspect or so the C shooter is. Once once were able to do that once notification is made them more details will be able to be shared. Most likely former counterterrorism division of that FBI headquarters. You know what. On the ground being fired. Right now the weapons recovered from the suspect who is dead. Where they hang and pay our fifteenth head assault rifle. And an unknown number of rounds but there were additional. Tired. It. We have no indication of and any change. We suspect. Three hours we. Are you winning. Between crime. Stoppers hired an immigrant. There was some communication that would and that means why didn't want weak area. Well remember this is a a situation involving hostages. Situation involving. Things that happened very fast and you. I think he was important for them to know exactly what they had once the initial shots were stopped they were dealing with day with a hostage situation so you. In that in that time we need to set up Regan reevaluate or reassess what what's happening. And make sure that all the pieces are plays we had the another staffing. Due to take care of a situation we have armored vehicles that come to the scene and there's workers year old in the rescue. Of those hostages are what we anytime we are hostage situation. We're definitely going to you use extreme measures to make sure that we have enough personnel on the scene. Had me. Jackets beat Aaron LV part of the investigation early this morning there were. Did. Five. Absolutely yes it is. As of this morning just based on what the initial officers solved without jeopardizing. Any more safety. Give it up for about. At least warning but now it's yeah it is definitely. One of the worst tragedies evening. Yes. I don't. There's no indication of that right now bets that all be part of the investigation. You know all of the news you were killed were shot during initial shooting and you work. Great shots fired. That there was initial shooting at 202 numerous shots fired and then there were. Gunshots exchanged between a swat team and the suspect. At at 0500 hours so it. Okay. That's I know him that's unknown at this time though he didn't plan right now he. Here. At this point I'm were just conducting a general investigation period. We'll determine officially whether to hate crime or terrorism incident or even a violent crime what's we have all the facts and place we're at the very early stages. As much as I would like to give you everything we have. We can't give you things that are a 100% accurate because then it doesn't it's not thirty years. Like statement holding it back. A bomb. And. I. Okay. Well again so since the subject has not been positively identified to the next of canned there's not a whole lot more we can share with you at this time also bear in mind that we do not want to jeopardize the investigation. Well we feel confident right now there are no other threats to the immediate area or the United States of America we need to be certain of that before we put any further information. An injured. There. Wherever and and you buy outs. Ireland. I don't noted it's time that there was one officer injured he was hit in need Kevlar helmet with around on the suspect.

It was still early in the investigation unknown how gotten inside. And here's like he was in there and then the shots were fired from preliminary implemented. Exceptionally terrible. Decades. One locations one hitting an absolutely. One of the worst tragedy energy. I. Okay. Former time. Okay.

One of the particular dangers that we do with the law enforcement as it relates to individuals that come back from the military. These are highly trained. They come with a very specific skill set. When you have incidents like this if it was very dangerous for us but at the same time. We have to be mindful of the fact that most veterans a comeback would never do anything like this.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/transgender-man-assaulted-vermont-homeless-shelter-dies-injuries/story?id=39477901,"A transgender man has died of wounds suffered from an alleged assault in a Vermont homeless encampment, according to police.

Amos Beede of Milton died Sunday at the University of Vermont Medical Center of injuries that included head trauma, facial fractures and broken ribs, Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo said in a statement.

Beede, 38, succumbed to his injuries one week after falling victim to an alleged aggravated assault, according to a police statement.

Beede's initial prognosis was positive, with police suggesting he would make a quick recovery. But that did not prove to be the case. The possibility of a hate crime has not been ruled out because of Beede's transgender identification, police said.

It's unclear whether there are suspects in the case, and a call by ABC News requesting comment from lead Det. Jeff Beerworth of the Burlington Police Department was not immediately returned.

Violence against transgender people is on the rise, according to a report issued in 2015 by The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, a national organization devoted to reducing instances of violence against LGBT people. The report indicated that while violence against LGBT issues was declining overall in America, crimes against specifically transgender people were escalating, climbing 13 percent against the broader trend.

The bulk of violence against transgender people is focused on transgender women, according to the report, but some advocates of LGBT rights, like columnist Loree Cook-Daniels argue that violence against transgender is often underreported because of the lack of adequate media coverage on the subject.

""However, what is far less discussed by the media or within the trans/LGB community is that other types of violence — the kinds of violence that affect thousands more trans people than do hate crimes resulting in murder — actually happen at least as often to transmasculine individuals as transfeminine individuals,"" Cook-Daniels said in a 2015 op-ed published in the LGBT-interest magazine, The Advocate.

That Beede was living in a homeless shelter at the time of his death highlights another obstacle facing transgender people living in America, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality, a nonprofit devoted to transgender rights.

""Homelessness is also a critical issue for transgender people; one in five transgender individuals have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Family rejection and discrimination and violence have contributed to a large number of transgender and other LGBQ-identified youth who are homeless in the United States – an estimated 20-40% of the more than 1.6 million homeless youth,"" the organization states on a page devoted to the subject of homelessness on their website.

The subject of transgender rights has become a critical one in 2016. North Carolina and the U.S. Justice Department sued each other earlier this month over escalating tensions regarding the state’s law banning transgender people from using bathrooms that don’t match the sex indicated on their birth certificate.

Also, Texas and 10 other states sued the Obama administration last week over its directive to U.S. public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity, regardless of what’s on their birth certificates.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/muslim-organization-touts-chewing-gum-cure-islamophobia/story?id=39376744,"In its first satirical attempt to challenge anti-Muslim bigotry, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, released a 1-minute ad Wednesday poking fun at discriminatory interactions many Muslims in the country regularly face. The organization claims that it has developed a “cure” for this in the form of a chewing gum called ISLAMOPHOBIN.

Who, exactly, is the ad aimed at?

“I think the answer is very, very simple. When it comes to irresponsible statements against Muslims, it’s Donald Trump and several of the GOP candidates,” CAIR’s Executive Director Nihad Awad said in an interview with ABC News.

“With the candidacy of Donald Trump, and people like him, we’ve seen a spike in Islamophobia, a spike in incidents and hate crimes, and we’re looking for ways to defend our communities and also for ways to defend American values,” he said.

The ad, he explained, is a way to incorporate humor into an organization that typically issues strong statements of condemnation.

“We believe humor and satire can go a long way,” Awad said, and should help “remind people that your Muslim neighbor is your friend, your Muslim co-worker is your friend.”

A recent Pew projection found that Muslims are projected to become the second-largest religious group in the U.S. (after Christians) by 2040. The American Muslim population will reach 8.1 million people, or 2.1 percent of the total population, by 2050.

The chewing gum – mint green Chiclets – are for sale on Amazon.com for $1.99 (plus a $4.49 shipping fee). CAIR said the proceeds support the group's civil rights and advocacy work.

According to the packaging, the gum is a “multi-symptom relief for chronic Islamophobia” and a “maximum strength formula” to treat blind intolerance, unthinking bigotry, irrational fear of Muslims and “U.S. presidential election year scapegoating.”

“We will be sending ISLAMOPHOBIN to any public figure who uses Islamophobic rhetoric, so Donald Trump is first on our list,” said Ibrahim Hooper, communications director of CAIR.

A “warning” states that ISLAMOPHOBIN “may result in peaceful coexistence.”

“Side effects” of ISLAMOPHOBIN may include “warm feelings toward Muslims, immigrants or refugees and an allergy to the promotion of anti-Muslim bigotry.”

Awad said the organization has seen an unprecedented spike in anti-Muslim incidents nationwide, and CAIR will be boosting its civic engagement leading up to the November election.

“Diversity in America. Freedom of religion. It’s who we are as Americans,” Awad said.",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/US/transgender-woman-records-strangers-tirade-allegedly-attacking-york/story?id=38851842,"A transgender woman in New York City said she is hoping to ""raise awareness about the daily violence trans people face"" by sharing video she recorded showing ""the transphobia and racism"" she said she recently ""had to take from a random stranger on the subway.""

Pearl Love told ABC News today she took the video last Thursday afternoon while commuting to her new job as an outreach social worker for Translatina Network.

""I just sat down and started reading my book but then this woman across me just randomly started yelling profanities at me and saying racist things,"" Love said. ""I tried to just ignore it as I usually do, but this woman kept going for over five minutes. She was getting louder and more aggressive, so I started recording because I was scared.""

In the video, the woman sitting across from Love on the subway car is first heard calling out Love for her ""mother------- women's bag"" and for ""living in a man’s penis and body with women’s makeup on.""

When the other woman on the subway apparently notices she's being recorded, she then be heard telling Love -- who is originally from Taiwan -- ""What you gon' do? Send it to China? What the f--- they gon' do?""

The woman then continues to yell at Love, the video shows, calling Love ""garbage,"" ""a transvestite"" and ""a f------ homo gay mother------ in some f------ women's products."" The woman later adds, ""Who are you really under all that makeup? Where'd you come from? Are you the emperor of China, or like, how are we supposed to act with you? What should we do about you 'cause this sh-- right here ain't appropriate for my child. I'm sorry I don't give a f---. I don't give a f---. I'll fight you right now. I don't even feel comfortable with you.""

The woman can then be seen getting up from her seat and appearing to slap the cellphone out of Love's hand before the video cuts off.

Love said that the woman then ""chased me around the train car and hit me, and before she left the train, she threw all the stuff in my bag on the floor."" Love added that one man helped her collect her scattered items, ""but other than that, no one came to help me when I was being attacked.""

Love said that she continued on about the rest of her day ""with a big smile despite the hurt inside."" She added that she posted the video to Facebook and YouTube on Monday after ""finally realizing what happened wasn't OK.""

The video had over 124,000 views on Facebook and over 64,000 views on YouTube as of this morning.

""This kind of thing actually happens to me all the time to the point where I start thinking OK, this is normal, it's OK,"" Love said. ""But then I was talking to my friends and fellow sisters about it, and I realized this is not right. I want to help educate people and have people understand what we go through every day as trans people.""

Love said she had not yet filed a report with police as of this morning but hopes to do so soon with the help and support of friends.

""I would love to go to the police station, but I am just a little scared because I'm originally from Taiwan, and I'm not sure how everything here works yet,"" she said.

A spokesman for the New York Police Department told ABC News on Tuesday that no formal complaints have been filed with police, though the department is aware of the video and has forwarded it to its Transit Bureau for review.",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-long-island-visit-evokes-2008-hate/story?id=38398270,"Donald Trump, whose campaign targeted illegal immigration from the beginning, will hit the trail on Long Island, New York, but a group of protesters there fear his appearance will dredge up old tensions in one community that’s still healing from a Latino hate crime eight years ago.

Trump will address the Suffolk County Republican Committee to raise funds for GOP candidates before the New York primary next Tuesday. The gala today will be held at the Emporium nightclub in Patchogue, a village on the south shore of Long Island, just blocks from where a white teen stabbed an Ecuadorian immigrant to death.

A group of teens pounced on 37-year-old Marcelo Lucero in 2008, a slaying for which a jury convicted Jeffrey Conroy in 2010, resulting in his 25-year sentence for first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime. Conroy was 17 at the time of the attack.

And while it won’t be the first time Trump’s event is distracted by demonstrators, Marcelo's brother, Joselo Lucero, has asked protesters “to not be involved in any confrontations.”

“I’m encouraging everyone to not be involved in any type of violence,” Lucero said on a video posted to Facebook today.

Joselo Lucero first reacted to the GOP front-runner's expected appearance in an op-ed titled, “Donald Trump’s LI visit dishonors my brother’s memory.”

“For me, it represents a flashback to the most painful time of my life: Marcelo’s violent death,” Lucero wrote in Newsday Wednesday. “They all paid for that act with prison terms, including a very long one for the person who stabbed my big brother. My family and I have paid, too, with endless grief.”

Lucero said he doesn’t “blame” Trump for attending the event in Patchogue.

“I blame John Jay LaValle, the Suffolk County Republican chairman,” Lucero said. “He should have known better than to invite someone who speaks so hatefully of immigrants to a fundraiser a short walk away from the site of the fatal attack on my brother.”

John Jay LaValle, the Suffolk County GOP Chair, endorsed Trump for president this month.

In a statement, LaValle offered the ""greatest empathy possible"" to the family of Lucero, but noted the venue is frequently used by the Suffolk County Republican Committee.

""We can’t help but to be suspicious of the motives of those leading the charge to connect that vicious hate crime with Mr. Trump’s commitment to enforcement of immigration laws that have gone largely ignored by both parties, for 30 years,"" LaValle said.

""Neither Mr. Trump, nor the Suffolk County Republican Committee’s more than 1,000 members, many of whom are Church-going upstanding members of the community, would ever condone a hate crime.""

Lucero wraps up the op-ed published in Newsday, saying: “I won’t carry picket signs and stand outside the nightclub to confront anyone. I’ll show up, as I have so often in the past, stand at the site I consider sacred to Marcelo’s memory, and remember him with a prayerful, peaceful vigil — accompanied by many compassionate people.”",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/accusers-alleged-racial-incident-university-albany-charged-assault/story?id=37351305,"Three black women attending the University of Albany who say they were the victims of a ""racially fueled"" on-campus attack in January by fellow white students now stand accused of assault in connection with the incident.

Asha Burwell, 20, of Huntington Station, N.Y.; Ariel Agudio, 20, of Huntington, N.Y.; and Alexis Briggs, 20, of Elmira Heights, N.Y., each face a charge of assault in the third degree, a crime punishable by up to a year in jail. Burwell and Agudio also face other charges including falsely reporting an incident in the third degree.

Each woman pleaded not guilty Monday during their arraignments in Albany City Criminal Court.

""We understand and believe that there is an enormous amount of community support for getting to the truth and that's where the defense team is headed,"" Burwell's lawyer Frederick Brewington said.

Around 1 a.m. Jan. 30, Agudio and Burwell made separate calls to 911, reporting that they'd been attacked while riding the Capital District Transportation Authority's No. 12 bus from downtown Albany, N.Y., to the university's campus.

In 911 calls, Agudio said one of her friends had asked a group of white students on the bus to be quiet because they were being too loud.

""I just got jumped on the bus and no one did anything. ... It was a racial crime. They were calling us ni---- and all this stuff. ... It was ridiculous. ... They ripped out all of our hair and everything. ... Boys were hitting us. ... It happened on the 12 bus,"" Agudio told a 911 dispatcher. ""No one called the cops. ... No one cared. ... It was a racially fueled crime. Three black girls shoved by, like, 20 white people.""

In a separate call, Burwell said: ""The bus driver didn't do anything about it until we got to campus and he stopped on the bus and still the guys continued to hit us in the face.""

Later that day, university president Robert J. Jones released a statement stating that he was concerned and saddened by the news that a group of 10 to 12 white males and females had used racial slurs toward three black women.

""There is no place in the UAlbany community for violence, no place for racial intolerance and no place for gender violence,"" he said in a statement.

And on Feb. 1, students gathered at a rally to show support for the three women, who also attended. The hashtag #DefendBlackGirlsUAlbany was circulated on Twitter, catching the attention of those inside and outside of Albany. Even former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton tweeted about the incident.

There's no excuse for racism and violence on a college campus. https://t.co/ADVghl4iEv -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 4, 2016

By Feb. 25, however, the University of Albany's police department had released a statement, saying that Burwell, Agudio and Briggs would be arrested and charged in the Jan. 30 incident.

According to the district attorney, Agudio, Burwell and Brigg had caused physical injury to a 19-year-old female passenger by ""repeatedly striking her""; Burwell had made physical contact with an 18-year-old female passenger; and Agudio had attempted to cause physical injury to a 19-year-old male passenger and had physical contact with two other females on the bus, ages 18 and 20.

Police said a three-week-long probe included interviews of 35 passengers on the bus as well as the review of various videos and audio recordings from bus security cameras and passengers' cellphones. Police said that evidence demonstrated that the three women had not been struck by a male and were in fact ""the aggressors in the physical altercation"" against the 19-year-old female passenger.

The false reporting charge stemmed from initial complaints made by Burwell and Agudio during the 911 calls that they'd been victimized, authorities said. Police called those allegations ""false.""

""The evidence shows that, contrary to how the defendants originally portrayed things, these three individuals were not the victims of a crime. Rather, we allege that they are the perpetrators,” police Chief J. Frank Wiley said in a statement. ""I especially want to point out that what happened on the bus was not a 'hate crime.' We spent a great deal of time carefully reviewing the audio recordings to determine whether any racial slurs were used. The only person we heard uttering racial epithets was one of the defendants. And it is important to note that no witness reported hearing any racial slurs directed at the defendants. And those witnesses were people from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds.""

In court Monday, Judge Rachel Kretser said the charges ""will have a profound impact on our community and, in fact if proven, are shameful,"" according to the Times Union.

In an updated statement posted on the school's website Feb. 26, university president Jones said: ""Our job as a University is to focus on learning from this incident. And our work now is to recommit to our principles of diversity and inclusivity -- which means including all people and treating all people fairly. The last month has been a challenging time for this University -- but I am very proud of how our campus community responded. On the first day, I asked you to show the world what the University at Albany truly stands for, and to reaffirm our values. And you have done that.""

Agudio's lawyer, Mark Mishler, called the charges ""unwarranted.""

""It is unfortunate that the University at Albany Police Department decided to charge Ms. Agudio. We believe these charges are unwarranted. It is also unfortunate that some in the media and public appear to have reached a conclusion as to what occurred in this incident without actually having the information needed in order to reach such a conclusion. Ms. Agudio, an exemplary young woman and an excellent student who has never previously been in legal trouble, asks that people not rush to judgment in this matter. We appreciate those who have spoken out in support of Ms. Agudio. This case will now play out in the court system. We trust, in the end, that Ms. Agudio will be vindicated,"" Mishler said in a previously released statement.

""I would ask people not to rush to judgment. There is a lot that has not been told in the media here. We plan on vigorously defending the allegations against Ms. Briggs, and I think in the end the truth will come out,"" Briggs' lawyer, Will Little, said.

The three charged women are still enrolled at the University of Albany, according to the university.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/year-review-13-biggest-news-stories-2015/story?id=35852690,"From start to finish, many of this year’s biggest news stories were centered around violence, terror threats or a general sense of fear.

The year began with a targeted terror strike in Paris and closed out with another planned attack in California, proving that threats around the globe remain an issue for all.

Domestically, mass shootings caused heartbreak and continuing the debate between those calling for stricter gun control and others arguing for the right to bear arms.

Here is a list of some of the biggest news stories of 2015.

1. Charlie Hebdo Attack in Paris

Terror struck in Paris one week into the New Year when a group of men with extensive ties to terrorist organizations targeted the offices of a famed satirical newspaper. Two men shot their way into the offices of Charlie Hebdo while a third waited near the getaway car. The shooters forced their way into the publication's offices, killing a maintenance man and police bodyguard assigned to protect the editor after he received death threats. Once arriving at the office, they proceeded to kill nine others, mostly editorial staff gathered for their weekly meeting, injuring an additional 11. A faction of al Qaeda claimed responsibility.

The attacks continued in France for two more days, taking the lives of six others, including two police officers and four people held hostage at a kosher grocery store in Paris. The three perpetrators also died.

2. Germanwings Plane Crash

A major aviation mystery in 2015 differed from the series of crashes the previous year in that the plane’s recording device led investigators to a suspect shortly after the deadly crash: the co-pilot. The recording from inside the cockpit of Germanwings Flight 9525 during the March 24 flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf indicated that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the lead pilot out of the cockpit during a break and proceeded to direct the plane toward the mountains of the French Alps, killing all 150 passengers and crew on board.

""The intention was to destroy the plane,"" Brice Robin, the public prosecutor of Marseille, said during the investigation.

3. Deaths by Police Officers

The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin led to the creation of #BlackLivesMatter in 2013, and the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner among others by police officers in Missouri and New York, respectively, carried the outrage through 2014. It was the deaths of Walter Scott and Freddie Gray, both at the hands of police officers, that fueled the outcry in 2015. Scott was fatally shot by a police officer following a traffic stop in South Carolina on April 4. Footage of the incident was recorded by a bystander that appeared to show Scott, who was unarmed, running away from the officer, identified later as Michael Slager. Slager was arrested three days after Scott’s death and charged with murder. His attorney says that Slager insists he is not guilty.

Just over a week later, in Baltimore, a man named Freddie Gray was picked up by police and put in a police transport vehicle without being properly strapped in. He suffered spinal injuries during the ride, which led to his death. Protests, some of them violent, erupted across Baltimore. After Gray’s death was ruled a homicide on May 1, six police officers were charged in connection to his death. All have pleaded not guilty. The first officer’s trial just concluded with a hung jury. A retrial is set for next June, after the other five officers are tried.

Chicago police also came under scrutiny for alleged misuse of force this year after footage of an October 2014 fatal shooting by police was released in November of this year following a court order. The video showed 17-year-old Laquan McDonald being hit 16 times. The officer involved in that shooting, Jason Van Dyke, was charged with his murder and has pleaded not guilty. Public criticism of the way authorities handled this case resulted in the firing of Chicago’s police superintendent, and a public apology from Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

4. Amtrak Train Crash

A train derailment in Philadelphia killed eight and injured more than 200 Amtrak passengers in May after the Northeast Regional train sped around a curve and went off the track. The train’s engineer. who survived, could not explain what caused the deadly crash. The National Transportation Safety Board led the investigation into the accident and determined that the train accelerated before the crash and had been traveling in excess of 100 mph, which was more than twice the speed limit for that area of the track.

5. Prison Escape in New York

One of the biggest stories of the summer seemed like something straight out of a Hollywood movie. It involved two prisoners, a sexual liaison with a prison worker who smuggled tools hidden in frozen meat and a midnight escape with a smiley-faced getaway note. David Sweat and Richard Matt, both convicted murderers, escaped from the maximum security Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York on June 6, crawling out of sewage pipes and digging through cell walls a la “The Shawshank Redemption.”

A huge manhunt took place over much of northern New York for the next three weeks. Law enforcement officers shot and killed Matt on June 26. They found Sweat two days later; in November, he pleaded guilty to all charges related to his escape.

The prison seamstress, Joyce Mitchell, was arrested and admitted to having had a sexual relationship with Matt, along with providing the tools. She was sentenced to up to 7 years in prison. Corrections officer Gene Palmer was charged with assisting the pair of inmates to escape. He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial.

6. Charleston Church Shooting

One of this year’s deadliest mass shootings struck a particularly heartbreaking chord because of its location: inside a church. The shooting at Charleston’s historic Emanuel AME Church in June caused national mourning and outrage, after a 21-year-old, reportedly with white supremacist beliefs, attended a Bible study session at the famed predominantly African-American church before allegedly opening fire on the group. The accused shooter, Dylann Roof, was apprehended the morning after the June 17 attack and is awaiting trial on 33 counts, including murder and firearms charges, as well as federal hate crime charges. The judge entered a not guilty plea on his behalf.

The shooting and Roof’s purported racist beliefs prompted a debate over the state’s continued use of the Confederate Battle Flag at South Carolina’s Capitol. After heated debate, the state legislature voted to have the flag taken down. It will be exhibited at a nearby museum.

7. On-Air Shooting in Virginia

The gunman in another tragic shooting claimed it was the racism of the Charleston church shooting that prompted him to create a scene of carnage in the late summer. Vester Lee Flanagan, a disgruntled former news anchor, shot two of his former colleagues while they were on the air on location for a Roanoke, Virginia, TV station. The Aug. 26 shooting left reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward dead. Flanagan later posted a video on social media of the shooting that he appeared to have filmed during the attack using a portable camera. He also sent a manifesto and called ABC News after the shooting. He shot himself to death during a car chase with police later that day.

8. Major Murder Trials

Four of the biggest trials of the year all resulted in guilty verdicts and one of those murderers now faces a death sentence. The first verdict came in February when Eddie Ray Routh was found guilty of killing “American Sniper” Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield. Though Kyle was well-known before the trial because of his bestselling book, the case gained even more national attention when his biopic came out just over a month before the trial started. Routh received a sentence of life without parole. He has filed a notice of appeal.

Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez was found guilty in April and sentenced to life in prison without parole after killing Odin Lloyd, who was dating Hernandez' fiancee’s sister. The case turned into a family drama as both Hernandez’s fiancee, who was granted immunity for her testimony, and her sister took turns on the witness stand. His appeal is underway.

In another case, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving brother of a pair of siblings, was found guilty in April of all 30 charges that he faced in connection to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and his ensuing flight from police, which included the killing of an MIT police officer. One month later, he was sentenced to death after the conclusion of the penalty phase of his trial. The first of many expected appeals is underway.

James Holmes, the shooter who opened fire inside a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado in 2012, was found guilty in July of killing 12 people in the rampage and injuring 70 others. While it took jurors only 12 hours to find him guilty, they were unable to reach a unanimous decision when it came to the penalty phase so he was spared the death penalty and sentenced in August to one life sentence for each life he took, plus 3,138 years for the attempted murders, without the possibility of parole. He has not appealed.

9. European Refugee Crisis

Tens of thousands of people fleeing war-torn Syria and other areas in the Middle East and Africa spent much of this summer making the laborious, and dangerous, trek through Europe toward countries including Germany and Sweden in hopes of finding asylum. The influx of refugee families prompted international disputes and policy shifts as countries such as Hungary started to close some of their borders and put up fences with razor wire to prevent people from entering. President Obama’s plan to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States met with stiff resistance from some House Republicans who have called for stricter certifications that none of the immigrants poses a security risk.

10. Same-Sex Marriage Debate

The Supreme Court made a landmark decision in June, voting to allow same-sex couples to marry nationwide. The 5-4 decision was praised by many, including President Obama, who called it a “victory for America.” But not everyone was pleased with the decision. A county clerk in Kentucky became a touchstone for the national debate after she claimed it was against her religious beliefs to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Kim Davis was jailed for nearly a week for defying a judge's order to issue any marriage licenses in Rowan County.

11. Pope Francis Visits the US

One of the biggest moments of national excitement came when Pope Francis made his inaugural visit to the United States, sweeping the country up in a serious case of Pope-mania. His visit started in Washington, D.C., after a trip to Cuba, and he went on to visit New York and Philadelphia before returning to the Vatican. Some of the highlights of the trip included a historic address to Congress, frequent rides in his Fiat and a particularly memorable moment shared with a baby girl dressed up like a pope.

12. Another Terror Attack in Paris

Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images

A series of coordinated terror attacks struck fear through the heart of the French capital on Friday Nov. 13. A combination of shooters and men wearing explosive vests targeted a football stadium, restaurants and a concert venue that evening, leaving 130 people dead.

French officials determined that the attackers had ties to ISIS, which has claimed responsibility. The alleged ringleader of the attacks was killed five days later when authorities raided his apartment in the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. An international manhunt is still underway at this time for at least one other suspect.

This year has been rife with terror attacks and thwarted incidents in France, starting with the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January but followed by at least two other incidents that were stopped before the casualty count jumped. One occurred in April, when a man suspected of planning an “imminent” attack in and around Paris was taken into custody after allegedly randomly killing a woman but also shooting himself, prompting him to call for an ambulance. Then in August, three American friends on vacation – Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, and Spencer Stone – helped thwart a would-be attacker on a train heading to Paris from Amsterdam.

13. Mass shootings (Roseburg, Lafayette, Chattanooga, Planned Parenthood, San Bernardino)

LA Times/Getty Images

From a college campus in Roseburg, Oregon, where 10 people were killed, or a military recruiting office in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where five people died, to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that left three dead, shootings were an all-too-familiar occurrence in this calendar year. The deadliest came on Dec. 2 in San Bernardino, California, where it’s alleged that a married couple opened fire at the Inland Regional Center during a Department of Public Health conference and holiday luncheon.

The San Bernardino shooting marked at least the 57th mass shooting this year where three or more people were killed, according to an ABC News analysis.

At the center of the Tuesday debate stage in Las Vegas will be front-runner Donald Trump, who called on “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" last week. This statement shifted the political conversation and created fears that unchecked borders will allow fundamentalist, Islamic State-affiliated Muslims to commit violent crimes like the murders in San Bernardino, a mass shooting that took the lives of 14 in California.

On Monday, following a rare meeting at the Pentagon with security officials, President Obama acknowledged American worries about the threat ISIS poses at home and abroad.

“We recognize that progress needs to happen faster,” the president said. “Even as we are relentless we need to be smart, targeting ISIL surgically and with precision.”

But as the administration amplifies efforts to destroy ISIS strongholds on the ground, Republican presidential candidates have criticized the White House’s national security agenda.

Jeb Bush has called for a no fly zone in Syria. Ted Cruz has spoken out against allowing Syrian refugees to enter the country. Rubio has warned against cutting defense spending. Chris Christie has raised concerns over Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina have recently called for stronger Internet intelligence surveillance.

On CNN’s State of the Union Jake Tapper spoke with Trump, probing the GOP front-runner on his controversial religious testing idea. Trump claimed the ban would be temporary, but stood by it.

“You have radicalism in this country,” he said. “It's here and it's trying to come through.”

The threat posed by Islamic terrorists is a top concern facing voters across the country, with ISIS operatives recently charged in states from Minnesota to Maryland. In a national NBC/WSJ poll released on Monday, 40 percent of Americans named national security and terrorism the primary concern for the federal government, up 19 percent since April.

Trump’s opponents scoffed at the idea of a Muslim ban with some calling the proposal “unconstitutional,” “outrageous,” and a transparent attempt to shift media attention back on his campaign following a slight dip in the national polls and Cruz’s surge in Iowa.

“Donald Trump needed the spotlight back,” Fiorina told the Des Moines Register. “It’s a violation of our Constitution, but it also undermines the character of our nation. We stand for religious liberty.”

But polls suggest his policy has tapped into Americans’ growing fears. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Monday found that 36 percent of Americans and 59 percent of Republicans support Trump’s proposed Muslim ban.

On Sunday’s “Meet the Press,” Rubio disagreed with Trump’s proposal but said that Trump “is reminding us in the process that people are really upset and they’re really scared. And they’re worried.”

But Trump’s proposal has sparked fear among Muslim Americans.

During the past week, anti-Muslim criminals have vandalized mosques, threatened hijab-wearing students, and even physically assaulted Muslim neighbors. This time frame comes shortly after the San Bernardino attack, which was committed by two ISIS-inspired Muslim Americans.

As the Justice Department predicted, there has been an uptake in anti-Muslim hate crimes.

Saba Ahmed, founder of the Republican Muslim Coalition, told ABC News that she will be carefully watching the debate “to see which candidate understands that Islam is not terrorism.”

“He’s using fear tactics,” said Ahmed. And while she said her coalition has been pleased with how some Republicans have come out in support of Muslim Americans, she fears others are missing the important and valuable role members of her faith could actually play in homeland security.

“I want to hear solutions—how are they going to be listening to Muslim Americans to solve our national security challenges?” she asked. “I think it’s going to be a very important role-- we’re the only ones who have the solutions to our problems, we’re the only ones who can actually deflect and destroy that ideology in our religion. What the terrorists are doing is completely un-Islamic and we must take back our faith from them.”",abcnews.com,True

Police in Hawthorne, California, responded on Sunday morning to a report of vandalism and a possible explosive device in front of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Baitus-Salaam Mosque, said the Hawthorne Police Department, whose detectives are leading the investigation.

Officers found graffiti on a fence saying ""Jesus,"" as well as what ""appeared to be a hand-grenade type of device in the driveway,"" said police.

The area was evacuated and the LA County Sheriff's Bomb Squad responded.

It was later determined that the device ""was a plastic replica of a hand-grenade,"" police said.

Separately, the police department was called about vandalism at the Islamic Center of Hawthorne, where the front of the building was spray-painted with the phrase, ""Jesus is the way,"" Hawthorne police said Sunday.

Both incidents appear to have occurred overnight, police said, and both incidents are being classified as possible hate crimes. The FBI's LA Field Office is also investigating, police said.

Jawdat Dajani, president of the board of directors at the Islamic Center of Hawthorne, told ABC News he believes the vandalism was in response to an inter-faith ""walk-and-rally"" held Saturday by the clergies of Hawthorne's St. Joseph Catholic Church and the Islamic Center of Hawthorne. The Hawthorne police chief, city and civic leaders, and over 200 parishioners participated, the Hawthorne police said.

""I feel bad because ... the day before, we had a walk for peace and healing,"" Dajani told ABC News.

""That same night ... somebody came,"" he said. ""Somebody who saw what happened and didn't like what happened, and wanted to express his anger.""

The center's members were notified of the vandalism, said Dajani, adding that everyone's reactions seemed calm. Dajani said he expects acts like vandalism, but doesn't want to make a ""big deal"" out of it and make situations ""tenser than they are.""

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Baitus-Salaam Mosque could not be immediately reached by ABC News for comment, but Ahsan Khan, a chapter president of the community, said, according to the Associated Press, ""This type of behavior is born out of ignorance and fear and we as members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community ... we respond with peaceful dialogue."" ""It's through peaceful dialogue that we can hopefully see less of this type of hate crime,"" Khan said, according to the AP.

The FBI said that ""investigators will work to identify the person or group responsible, the motivation and whether religious bias was a factor.""

""All evidence will be reviewed by state and federal prosecutors to determine whether a violation under federal civil rights statutes occurred,"" the FBI's statement said.

The Hawthorne police said that staff from its Community Affairs Unit are ""working in closer dialogue with our area Islamic faith centers ever since the tragic events occurring in San Bernardino.""

""The Department will continue to closely support our faith-based partners and work to assure the safety of its members,"" the police said.

Just days before these mosque attacks in Hawthorne, a fire was reported at the Islamic Society of Palm Springs in Coachella, California. Carl James Dial, 23, was arrested in connection with the fire.

One of the alleged victims filmed the incident, which happened in Lake Chabot Regional Park on Sunday, four days after the San Bernardino shooting.

The woman, identified by the park district as Denise Slader, ""engaged them in some kind of conversation"" that led to her using disparaging language about the men's Muslim beliefs, according to Carolyn Jones, the spokeswoman for the East Bay Regional Park District Police Department.

One of the men in the group, Rasheed Albeshari, told ABC station KABC-TV that when he responded saying that they respect Jesus, the woman became visibly upset. Albeshari took video of her, and according to KABC-TV she can be heard saying: ""Your mind has been taken over, brainwashed. And you have nothing but hate, nothing but hate.""

Slader allegedly hit one of the men with an umbrella and threw a cup of coffee at him, Jones said. After that, parks workers separated them, she said.

Slader did not respond to ABC News' calls for comment.

A spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed that Slader has worked for them as a program technician for approximately 10 years.

""We expect all of our employees to treat everyone with dignity and respect both on and off the job,"" CDCR spokesman Luis Patino told ABC News in a statement. ""In addition to the police investigation, an internal CDCR investigation into the incident is ongoing. We cannot comment on the specifics of that investigation, however, discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.""

Jones said that the park district recommended that she be charged with a misdemeanor battery but the District Attorney must determine any charges. Assistant District Attorney Teresa Drenick told ABC News that ""additional investigation was necessary"" and Jones confirmed that the police are continuing their investigation into the incident.

Jones said that police have met with Slader since the incident and ""she definitely sees herself as the victim in all this."" Jones noted that it is legal to both pray and film in the park.

""Everyone at the park district is appalled by this incident,"" Jones said.

This is not the first alleged religious-based incident reported in the wake of the recent terror attacks in San Bernardino and Paris.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/department-justice-anti-muslim-hate-speech/story?id=35585946,"U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch pledged that the Department of Justice will go after hate speech that might incite violence against the Muslim community, she told a crowd of Muslim-Americans and supporters Thursday night.

“Obviously this is a country that is based on free speech,” Lynch told the audience at the Muslim Advocates dinner in Arlington, VA. “But when that edges towards violence…we will take action.”

Muslim Advocates, a legal advocacy group, asked Lynch to address concerns about an uptick in anti-Muslim rhetoric and hate crimes.

Since 9/11, Lynch says that the Department of Justice has investigated more than 11,000 acts of anti-Muslim rhetoric, which have led to 45 prosecutions. “I think sadly, that number is going to rise,” said Lynch.

Farhana Khera, Director of Muslim Advocates, told ABC News that the organization and 46 others, including the Presbyterian and American Baptist churches, sent a letter in late September to the RNC and DNC expressing concern over “divisive rhetoric being used by some presidential candidates.”

Khera said the inflammatory language towards Muslims on the campaign trail has persisted. Only the DNC responded to the letter.

In recent weeks, Donald Trump advocated for a national registry of Muslim Americans -- which he later denied -- and claimed that Muslims in New Jersey celebrated after the September 11 attacks.

“The demagoguery has to stop,” Muslim American Congressman Andre Carson (D-IN), who introduced Lynch, told ABC News. Carson said that public figures make these remarks because they “get affirmation from being provocative.”

But Lynch says that language generates fear.

“When you feel that fear, that sense of lack of control, and the inability to do something about it, you start to spin and try to find ways that you think will be the easy fix…anti-Muslim rhetoric becomes that path,” said Lynch. “We also will not give into fear.”

On this count, when it comes to mass shootings and their aftermath, the political class has failed. If anything, the responses we've come to expect now only add to a nation's numbness. But the simple fact is that politicians and candidates aren't feeling voter pressure to change their responses or their policy positions. Part of the ritual now is the numbness, followed by the forgetfulness.

WHAT A SECRET MEMO TO TOP REPUBLICANS SAYS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. The head of the Republican committee charged with keeping the U.S. Senate under GOP control is actively preparing for the possibility of Donald Trump winning the GOP presidential nomination. ABC's RYAN STRUYK and SHUSHANNAH WALSHE report that National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director Ward Baker wrote a secret memo to top staff in late September on how to run their campaigns if the real estate mogul is at the top of the ticket, describing the current GOP frontrunner as ""a misguided missile"" who is ""subject to farcical fits"" and advising its candidates to avoid getting tied too closely to Trump. ""We should prepare for 2016 by understanding the environment and recognizing the Trump phenomenon,"" Baker writes in the confidential memo. ""Understand the populist point Trump makes and ride that wave."" The memo also warns candidates to distance themselves from Trump's comments about women. ""Houston, we have a problem: Donald Trump has said some wacky things about women,"" he wrote. ""Candidates shouldn't go near this ground other than to say that your wife or daughter is offended by what Trump said."" http://abcn.ws/1l9slTM

HILLARY CLINTON CALLS FOR FEDERAL INVESTIGATION OF CHICAGO POLICE FOLLOWING LAQUAN MCDONALD SHOOTING. Hillary Clinton is calling for a federal probe of the Chicago Police Department's tactics following the shooting of Laquan McDonald, according to a spokesperson. This stance goes against the position of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former Chief of Staff to President Obama and longtime friend and colleague of Clinton's, who has said a local task force would be more appropriate for the review. ""Hillary Clinton is deeply troubled by the shooting of Laquan McDonald and the outstanding questions related to both the shooting and the video,"" spokesperson Brian Fallon said in a statement. According to ABC's LIZ KREUTZ, Clinton's call for a federal review comes roughly one week after the Chicago officials released disturbing video from October 2014 showing a white police officer shooting 17-year-old McDonald. http://abcn.ws/21wM6Fj

TED CRUZ SAYS MAJORITY OF VIOLENT CRIMINALS ARE DEMOCRATS, AUTHORS OF STUDY HE CITED SAY HE'S WRONG. The researchers behind a study that Sen. Ted Cruz cited to back up his statement Monday that the ""overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats"" are pushing back on Cruz's assertion. In a piece published by the Washington Post, Ivy League researchers Marc Meredith and Michael Morse use their own data to refute Cruz's assertion, which he stood by in an interview with ABC News on Tuesday, saying that he can make a ""reasonable inference,"" drawing from data on the voting registration of ex-felons who re-registered to vote in three states, that most violent criminals vote Democratic. ""I don't think you can make that inference based on the data we provided,"" Meredith said in a phone interview with ABC News. ABC's ALI WEINBERG has more. http://abcn.ws/1XzK73w

MARCO RUBIO ON UPPING HIS HISPANIC OUTREACH ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. As the son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has yet to use one of his biggest assets -- the potential he has to win over Hispanics. It's been estimated that Republicans must win over 40% of the Hispanic vote if they are to win the White House. Rubio declared his candidacy in April, but since then has done very little Hispanic outreach nationwide. There was a campaign stop in Puerto Rico in September, which he conducted entirely in Spanish. There were a couple events in Las Vegas in October. One was at the LIBRE Initiative, a nonprofit Latino-outreach group funded by the Koch brothers; the other at a Cuban diner. But other than those three stops, Rubio hasn't hosted other public events specifically geared towards Hispanics. Though he is fully bilingual, he very rarely speaks Spanish out on the stump, ABC's INES DE LA CUETARA notes. In addition, the campaign has yet to run any Spanish-language ads. The campaign declined to say whether it was doing any Hispanic outreach behind closed doors. http://abcn.ws/1RmSsCP

WHAT REPORTER BEHIND 9/11 REPORT SAYS ABOUT TRUMP'S CLAIMS. For almost two weeks now, Donald Trump has been asserting that ""thousands"" of Muslims in New Jersey were celebrating the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Wednesday, a senior adviser to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Dan Scavino, said he was backing up Trump's claims by tweeting a video report by former WCBS-TV reporter Pablo Guzman describing celebrations in Jersey City, N.J., after the World Trade Center collapsed. Guzman said the video does not show anyone celebrating and he disputes Trump's claims. ABC's JOHN SANTUCCI and VERONICA STRACQUALURSI have more on what now-retired Guzman told ABC News. http://abcn.ws/1XzgEqD

--CLINTON CALLS FOR GUN CONTROL: In her most extensive remarks since the shooting at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado on Friday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton doubled down on her support for the organization, ABC's LIZ KREUTZ notes. ""We should be supporting Planned Parenthood, not attacking it. And it is way past time for us to protect women's health and respect women's rights not use them as political footballs,"" Clinton said in New Hampshire last night during her remarks at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Manchester. ""Here in New Hampshire, Republicans on your executive council cut off funding to Planned Parenthood. And in Congress and on the campaign trail, Republicans who claim they just hate big government are only too happy to have government step in when it comes to women's bodies and health. It's wrong and we're not going to stand for it."" Clinton described Planned Parenthood as a place where women can get the health care they need, such as ""breast exams and STD testing, contraception and yes safe and legal abortions."" She also offered her condolences for the victims of the shooting, and called for gun control measures. ""How many more Americans need to die before we take action?"" Clinton asked.

--MARTIN O'MALLEY WEIGHS IN: Clinton rival, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley also responded to the shooting in New Hampshire last night, according to ABC's MARYALICE PARKS: ""This most recent act of terror took place at a Planned Parenthood. Others have taken place in classrooms, in schools, in church basements. We cannot treat these acts of terrible violence as isolated events. We have call them what they are: acts of intolerance, racism, and hate,"" he said. ""They are designed to prey on the vulnerable and the unsuspecting. They are acts of terror.""

--PLANNED PARENTHOOD BLAMES GOP RHETORIC FOR 'TOXIC ENVIRONMENT': While many have condemned the shooting at the Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic, Planned Parenthood yesterday accused some of those same GOP candidates of contributing to the creation of a ""toxic environment"" that provoked the attack, ABC's JORDYN PHELPS reports. ""It is offensive and outrageous that some politicians are now claiming this tragedy has nothing to do with the toxic environment they helped create,"" Planned Parenthood Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said in a statement released Sunday. Laguens singles out Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina by name, accusing them of ""using this tragedy to repeat false claims about Planned Parenthood,"" and says it's not enough to denounce the tragedy without also stopping their rhetoric against the organization. http://abcn.ws/1lSQ7Uc

--BEN CARSON URGES PEACEFUL DIALOGUE ON PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN WAKE OF COLORADO SPRINGS SHOOTING. Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson called on pro-choice and pro-life advocates to express their differences in a peaceful manner in the wake of a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs that left three dead Friday. ""What we really have to start asking ourselves is what can we do as a nation to rectify the situation,"" Carson said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""I think we should talk about the actual facts. If we can get rid of the rhetoric from either side and actually talk about the facts, I think that's when we begin to make progress."" Carson condemned the shooting at the clinic, calling it a hate crime, ABC's KATHERINE FAULDERS notes. ""Unfortunately, there is a lot of extremism coming from all areas,"" Carson said. http://abcn.ws/1XpbnBP

--WHAT OTHERS IN THE GOP ARE SAYING: Fiorina, who has been one of the most outspoken GOP candidates in her opposition to Planned Parenthood and continues to allege that the organization has ""harvested"" fetal body parts for sale, called the shooting a ""tragedy"" that cannot be justified. According to ABC's JORDYN PHELPS, Fiorina told Fox News, ""What I would say to anyone who tries to link this terrible tragedy to anyone who opposes abortion or opposes the sale of body parts, this is typical left-wing tactics."" Trump, speaking on NBC yesterday, called the attack ""terrible"" and the shooter a ""maniac."" When asked whether he thought the rhetoric against Planned Parenthood has grown too extreme, Trump replied, ""No."" Unlike Mike Huckabee, Sen. Ted Cruz isn't calling the shooting an act of domestic terrorism. Cruz also refuted those who say rhetoric against Planned Parenthood led to the shooting. ""Well I think there has been some vicious rhetoric on the left. Blaming those who are pro-life. I'll tell you I am proud to be unambiguously pro-life...This murder that occurred in Colorado is tragic. It is a criminal act, we don't fully know the motivations of this deranged individual,"" Cruz said yesterday in a gaggle in Newton, Iowa. http://abcn.ws/1lSQ7Uc

--ANALYSIS -- ABC's RICK KLEIN: Either the abortion debate starts to become about guns, or the gun-control debate starts to become about the rhetoric surrounding abortion. In either scenario, the shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado turned, with all expected speed, into another political discussion that ends (or, rather, doesn't) with no particular satisfaction. Planned Parenthood and gun-control groups decried a political season that's made casual violence less surprising than it should be. Carly Fiorina, who has made the secret Planned Parenthood videos a centerpiece of her campaign, called such talk ""typical left-wing tactics."" Sen. Ted Cruz moved to separate the alleged gunman from the conservative movement. ""We know that he was a man who registered to vote as a woman,"" Cruz said. A campaign season might be the last time of any year that one might expect sober and serious consideration around current events. This campaign year in particular seems designed to prove that point.

DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE WASN'T MAKING FUN OF REPORTER'S DISABILITY. GOP frontrunner Donald Trump says he wasn't mocking a New York Times reporter's muscular disorder when he made jerking motions seeming to imitate the man's condition during a speech last week, saying Saturday at a rally in Sarasota, Florida, that he was just showing a reporter who was ""groveling."" ""I was very expressive in saying it, and they said that I was mocking him,"" Trump said. ""I would never mock a person that has difficulty. I would never do that. I'm telling you, I would never do it."" Trump has insisted that he does not know the reporter, Serge Kovaleski, and was unaware of his condition, ABC's JORDYN PHELPS writes. Kovaleski has disputed Trump's claim and said he was on a first-name basis with the real estate mogul when he covered him for the New York Daily News in the 1980s. http://abcn.ws/1IgRki3

JOHN KASICH REFUSES TO SAY IF HE WOULD SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP AS REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. Ohio Gov.John Kasich would not commit on Sunday to supporting frontrunner Donald Trump as the party's nominee, saying that he did not expect the real estate mogul to win. ""I think he's very divisive and I do not believe he will last,"" Kasich said when asked if he would support Trump if he wins the Republican primary. Kasich pointed to Trump's recent back and forth with The New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski as a reason he won't win the nomination, ABC's BENJAMIN GITTLESON notes. Trump has drawn criticism this week for appearing to mimic Kovaelski's mannerisms, caused by a muscular disorder, which Kasich said Trump ""absolutely mocked."" ""Somebody who divides this country, here in the 21st century, who's calling names of women and Muslims and Hispanics and mocking reporters, and says, 'I didn't do it,' but he did do it, it's just not going to happen,"" said Kasich. http://abcn.ws/1TeXGPg

MARTIN O'MALLEY COMPARES DONALD TRUMP'S LANGUAGE TO FASCISM. Democratic presidential hopeful Martin O'Malley said Sunday night that Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is making ""the sort of appeal that historically has often preceded fascism."" ""Trump says we should be monitoring everyone of the Muslim faith, keeping some kind of registry, maybe even issuing special ID cards,"" the former Maryland governor said during his remarks at the New Hampshire Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner. He continued with an unmistakeable Nazi comparison. ""Let me ask you this. Who is next? Catholics? Trade unionists? Artists? We've seen this road before, and it does not lead to a good place,"" he said. After the speech, reporters pressed O'Malley on whether he thought Trump himself was a fascist. O'Malley would not say so explicitly, but said the language Trump uses is similar, ABC's MARYALICE PARKS reports. http://abcn.ws/1NkuOVE

CARSON CALLS ON U.S. TO HELP REFUGEES SETTLE IN MIDDLE EAST. Ben Carson said Saturday the United States must do more to help solve the Syrian crisis, but that bringing 25,000 refugees from the conflict to the U.S. will ""do nothing."" The Republican presidential candidate was in Jordan on Saturday, where he visited a refugee camp and met with medical professionals, humanitarian workers and government officials. Campaign officials told ABC News that Carson was traveling to Jordan on a ""fact finding and information gathering mission."" ""These brave people want nothing more than an end the war in Syria. They want to go back to their lives. We must find a political end to this conflict. Millions of refugees have now been waiting for years for the end of the war to come in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey,"" Carson said in a statement released to ABC News. According to ABC's KATHERINE FAULDERS, the visit marks the first time one of the 2016 candidates has visited such a camp since the refugee crisis began this year.

HILLARY CLINTON CALLS FOR ADDITIONAL $275 BILLION TO MODERNIZE INFRASTRUCTURE NATIONWIDE. Hillary Clinton unveiled a five-year, $275 billion plan Sunday to rebuild and modernize the nation's infrastructure, which she says will be a ""down payment on our future."" ""To build a strong economy for our future we must start by building strong infrastructure today, and putting you and your members to work,"" Clinton said. ""I have a five-year, $275 billion plan to invest on our infrastructure, create good paying jobs and build the future America deserves. Clinton's plan, which she unveiled at the launch of ""Hard Hats for Hillary"" at Faneuil Hall in downtown Boston, would include the creation of an infrastructure bank and would be paid for by a ""business tax reform,"" according to her campaign. The release of her plan marks the beginning of her campaign's month-long focus on jobs, ABC's LIZ KREUTZ notes. http://abcn.ws/1HyrANY

TED CRUZ DOES 'PRINCESS BRIDE' IMPRESSION. He's quoted ""Jerry Maguire,"" ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Scarface"" on the campaign trail, but it's clear, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz loves ""The Princess Bride"" the most. At a church service yesterday in Des Moines, Iowa, the presidential hopeful was prodded by the pastor of Christian Life Assembly of God to offer an impression from his favorite movie. It didn't take much prodding. ""I will confess to knowing an awful lot of that movie,"" Cruz said. Cruz has previously said it's his favorite movie. According to ABC's JESSICA HOPPER, Cruz launched into a two-minute reenactment of a scene that had him acting the parts of four characters made famous by Billy Crystal, Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin and Carol Kane.

NEW HAMPSHIRE UNION LEADER ENDORSES CHRIS CHRISTIE. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's struggling presidential bid got a welcome boost this weekend in an endorsement from the New Hampshire Union Leader. ""In just 10 weeks, New Hampshire will make a choice that will profoundly affect our country and the world. We better get it right,"" the newspaper's publisher Joseph McQuaid wrote in the endorsement. ""Our choice is Gov. Chris Christie."" One of the Granite State's leading newspapers, the Union Leader's endorsement is a significant development for the Christie's campaign, which has so far failed to gain traction in the crowded Republican primary, ABC's JORDYN PHELPS reports. ""Gov. Christie is right for these dangerous times,"" the editorial continued. ""He has prosecuted terrorists and dealt admirably with major disasters. But the one reason he may be best-suited to lead during these times is because he tells it like it is and isn't shy about it."" http://abcn.ws/1PUqui5

And Ben Carson joins us now from Jordan. Good morning, Dr. Carson. We'll get to your trip in a moment. But first, your reaction to what happened in Colorado Springs. Well, obviously, any hate crime is a horrible thing. No matter from where it comes and should be condemned very strongly. Dr. Carson, the planned parenthood rocky mountain's Vicki Cowart said extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country. Do you agree with that? Unfortunately, there's a lot of extremism coming from all of the areas. One of the biggest areas I think that's threatening to tear our country apart. We get into our separate corners and we hate each other, we want to destroy those who we disagree. That comes from both sides. There's no saint here in this equation. But what we have to start asking ourselves is, what can we do as a nation to rectify this situation? How can we begin to engage in rational discussion? All you have to do is go to an article on the internet and go to the comments section, you don't get five comments down before people start calling each other names and abouting like idiots. What happened to us? What happened to the civility that used to characterize our society? And you're in Jordan right now and have had quite the trip to visit refugees, what have you learned about refugees that you didn't know before? Well, I was very pleasantly surprised to see how welcoming they are. I had an opportunity to talk to many of the Syrian refugees and ask them, what is your supreme desire? And it was pretty uniform. They want to go back home, obviously, and I said, what kind of things could a nation like the United States do that would be helpful to you? And again, I was a little bit surprised with the answer. Because it wasn't what we're hearing a lot. We're hearing that they all want to come here to the united States. That's not what they want. They want to go back home. They said the United States and other nations could be much more supportive of the efforts manifested by the Jordanians in taking in people, at a lot of expense to themselves. They can't continue that without the help of the international community. You know, you look at last month, we spent $3 billion on Halloween candy, that's the amount of money that's needed to bridge the shortfall for a year that they're having in Jordan with the refugees. Dr. Carson, we spend more than $4 billion in humanitarian aid, to Jordan for the refugees, so what more could they possibly be doing? Well, you know, you have to go there and see for yourself. But you can see there are a lot of individual modules that they have created for their families, they're in the process of trying to get electricity to all of them, getting pluming to all of them, and they have taken in millions of people. For us to bring 10,000 or 25,000 people over here, that doesn't solve the problem. I mean, we need to look at real solutions for the problem and not things that make us feel Dr. Carson, I have been to the refugee camps and found the same thing, they want to go either back to Syria, which doesn't look possible at this point, or they want to go somewhere else. They want jobs. Do you welcome them into America now, has anything changed your mind? Well, when you say, you know, they want to escape the refugee camps, the main reason that any of them want to escape the refugee camps is because there's not adequate support there for them. If there were adequate support, it would be a completely different story and we can provide that adequate support -- The people I talked to, they don't want to stay there. They don't want to stay there permanently, they want to be repatriated into their own country. Is that going to be easier from a neighboring country or from the United States? Dr. Carson, by taking this trip in the middle of the campaign, are you acknowledging that you weren't quite prepared to be commander in chief? I'm acknowledging that I like to know what I'm talking about. It's the same situation when I went this summer down to the border of Mexico. And, you know, I knew that there were problems there, but to be actually able to talk to the farmers who are being harassed and to the sheriffs and sheriff's deputies who are frustrated after risking their lives and then been told by I.C.E. You must release these people. Seeing a fence with holes cut in it that people can easily go through, and that's barrier. It's good to see things for yourself so you can begin to formulate the right kind of policies with the right information. So, what are the right kind of policies for those Syrian refugees, should America be taking some of those refugees? I believe that the right policy is to support the refugee program that is in place, that works extremely well but does not have aid adequate funding. If you do that, you solve that problem without exposing the American people to a population that could be infiltrated with terrorists who want to destroy us. If you can eliminate the possibility of terrorists infiltrating them and wanting to destroy us you would have a different argument. But I don't see that being eliminated. Do you think there were terrorists among those refugees who you talked to? I don't know whether there were or not. But I do know that the Isis' terrorists have said that if we bring refugees that they would infiltrate them and why wouldn't they? And I want to ask you quickly about Isis. I was in Iraq last week. I was in the air combat command center. Would you like to see the rules of engagement loosen? One of the things they told me, they aim for zero civilian casualties. And sole purpose Isis structure. Should that change? What I would really like to see is an administration that really seriously sits down with our experts in that region and would ask them, what is needed in order to accomplish our goal of eliminating this group of terrorists? That's what I would really like to see. So, you don't know whether or not you would rules of engagement -- Those of us who are not experts in that area can sit around all day long talking about, oh, we should do this and we should do that. Why don't we listen to the people who are the experts in that area, find out what it is they need. And our decision should be, do we really want to give them what they need? Or continue playing around like we are. Okay, thanks very much, Dr. Carson.

But we start off in Colorado -- brand new details on the investigation into that deadly shootout at Planned Parenthood, revelations the shooter may have been targeting the group. Our exclusive interview with a top Planned Parenthood official momentarily.

First, ABC's Clayton Sandell on the ground with the latest -- good morning, Clayton.

CLAYTON SANDELL, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Martha.

Investigators here are trying to piece together the facts here this morning, but also trying to get inside the mind of an alleged killer.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

SANDELL (voice-over): This morning. Law enforcement sources are not officially saying why they think Robert Dear allegedly launched a five hour attack.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) is working an active shooter.

SANDELL: But they do say after his surrender and arrest in Colorado Springs, he allegedly made rambling hostile statements about his target, Planned Parenthood.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're pinned down -- we're getting active gunfire.

SANDELL: On Saturday, police and federal agents showed up to his remote trailer home in Hartsel, Colorado, 90 minutes away, where neighbors say Dear kept to himself, but always seemed a little off.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We got some anti-Obama pamphlets. So that was just kind of weird, just like three minutes of meeting somebody and they're already wanting to give you that kind of stuff.

SANDELL: U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch calls the shooting a crime against women receiving health care at Planned Parenthood. The organization itself says the gunman was motivated by opposition to safe and legal abortion.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It happened at a Planned Parenthood Center.

SANDELL (on camera): What does that tell you?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My -- my suspicions are is that this -- that has a lot to do with the motive.

SANDELL (voice-over): But knowing the motive won't brig back three victims, one a 44-year-old University of Colorado police officer, Garrett Swasey, a married father of two, once a champion junior ice skater.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And he wanted to be in the Olympics and he wanted to make a mark.

SANDELL: The two other people killed still haven't been officially identified. Nine more were wounded, but expected to be OK.

Others just feeling lucky.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When I saw myself in the mirror and it's like, my god, he was aiming for my head.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

SANDELL: Now, law enforcement sources tell us the Department of Justice considers this a case of domestic terrorism, but state murder charges will take first priority. We are also told Dear is talking to investigators, sometimes rambling, other times sounding perfectly rational. But they say they may never understand his motive or mental state.

He'll be in court on Monday -- Martha.

RADDATZ: Thanks, Clayton.

Joining us now, the mayor of Colorado Springs, John Suthers.

Mr. Mayor, what more can you tell us -- tell us about the motivation in this killing?

MAYOR JOHN SUTHERS, COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO: Well, Martha, the police and the prosecutor have not officially released anything about the motivation. As a former district attorney, I’m very respectful of that. And I will wait, you know, the release of official information before I will comment on the motivation.

RADDATZ: But do you believe Planned Parenthood was targeted?

SUTHERS: It certainly appears that way. I’m sure that as the case proceeds, the criminal case proceeds, we'll learn a lot more about the motivation.

RADDATZ: Do you know anything more about these statements he allegedly made about Planned Parenthood or about abortion?

SUTHERS: I know what you know, that somebody unauthorized made some statements to the press, but I’m not going to contribute to that, Martha. I’m going to let the police and the prosecutors do their jobs.

RADDATZ: What more can you tell us this morning about how -- how this happened?

The gunman killed one of your officers and yet you still managed to take the suspect alive.

SUTHERS: Yes, it was a kind of an unusual situation in the fact that he gave himself up alive.

Martha, I was in the command center watching this unfold, and the police just did a fantastic job. From the command center, they were able to monitor security cameras in the center and advise the squad officers inside about the movement of the perpetrator. And that sort of coordination, they were, you know, e-mailing diagrams about the building inside to the SWAT team. And that coordination, I’m absolutely certain, saved a number of lives, because they were able to get people out of the building that were in areas that the perpetrator was not.

RADDATZ: Incredible work by your officers.

We also heard that the gunmen left some unspecified items outside, possibly explosives or bags.

Have you cleared the scene there now?

SUTHERS: There were some things in his truck. I’m not sure they’ve been identified as having, you know, being related. We’re just going to have to -- the crime scene is still being processed. We’re going to have to wait to see what the police and prosecutor tell us about that.

RADDATZ: But would you say, Mr. Mayor, this is an act of domestic terrorism?

SUTHERS: It certainly appears that way. We have, Martha, something that occurs quite a bit. We have a person that’s pretty much off the grid and acting for whatever motivation. Very hard to ferret out those folks. You know, I -- I was an attorney general that was a head of a committee looking at things that are consistent about these kinds of incidents. And one of the things we don’t do very well is identify these people, sometimes with mental health problems, and prevent their access to weapons. And I -- you know, we’ll wait and see here, but all indications are this guy, as I say, was off the grid.

RADDATZ: OK, thank you very much, Mayor Suthers.

Now let's turn to the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountains, Vicki Cowart, joining us in an ABC News exclusive.

Ms. Cowart, do you believe the facility was targeted because it is a Planned Parenthood facility?

VICKI COWART, PRESIDENT & CEO, PLANNED PARENTHOOD ROCKY MOUNTAINS: Good morning.

Like the mayor, I have the same kinds of information. It’s been reported that the individual that did this crime had ramblings about abortion. But we didn’t have any advance notice.

But it does appear that it does -- it was targeted at us, from what we’ve heard.

RADDATZ: And walk us through what happened with your staff. We heard about this incredible coordination on security, but where your staff was, what you know about what happened inside.

COWART: Thank you for asking that question because our focus really has been around our staff. Planned Parenthood holds the safety and the well-being of our patients and our staff at the very top of our list. It’s our most important thing. And I’m so pleased that all of our staff got out of the building safe, uninjured.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

COWART (voice-over): What happened was they evidently heard a shot and were able to move right into their training.

And I want to give a huge shout out to the building who were in that health center because they responded perfectly, according to their training. They got away from the front of the building; they got into the back, locked portions of the building. They called 9-1-1 immediately.

They moved into locked office spaces, not one big space but different office spaces around the building, and they hunkered down. They quieted their cell phones, they didn’t talk and they waited for the officials to rescue them.

And we are so, so thankful for the first responders and the law enforcement in Colorado Springs, and heartbroken at the loss of an officer, who was one of the first responders.

RADDATZ: It is truly a tragedy. I want to move back to this idea of domestic terrorism again. You’re being cautious about what the suspect may or may not have said. But you have said in a statement that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism.

COWART: We’ve experienced so much hateful language, hateful speech. Such a negative environment has been created around the work that Planned Parenthood does, around the idea of safe and legal abortion.

And we’ve seen that across the country from all sorts of speakers in the last few months. I can’t believe that this isn’t contributing to some folks, mentally unwell or not, thinking that it’s OK to target Planned Parenthood or to target abortion providers.

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: Are you talking about members of Congress?

COWART: So I think we are at a place --

RADDATZ: Are you talking about politicians?

COWART: I think politicians have been in that conversation and, I mean, you know that the airwaves are full of anti-abortion language, of anti-Planned Parenthood accusations, much of which is false in nature.

And we at Planned Parenthood are, first and foremost, a healthcare provider. We provide life-saving services to all kinds of folks, men and women, across our communities. And the tirades against Planned Parenthood in the last few months have really been over the top.

RADDATZ: Thanks very much for joining us, Vicki Cowart, this morning.

Turning now to 2016 and Ben Carson, heading overseas to Jordan, meeting face-to-face with Syrian refugees after coming under fire for his lack of foreign policy experience.

Ben Carson joins us shortly; first, the latest from ABC's Tom Llamas.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DR. BEN CARSON (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're just getting a good impression of what's going on.

TOM LLAMAS, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ben Carson's campaign releasing these images from his surprise trip to Jordan.

CARSON: This clinic seems to be very nice.

LLAMAS (voice-over): Carson visiting refugee camps where Syrians have fled civil war says the U.S. must do more. But bringing 25,000 refugees to the United States does nothing to solve this crisis. Jordan already houses 1.4 million refugees; Jordan needs and deserves our help.

The overseas trip coming as Carson has taken new heat for his foreign policy comments, like wrongly asserting that China was involved in the Syrian civil war.

CARSON: You know, the Chinese are there as well as the Russians.

LLAMAS (voice-over): And comparing the screening of refugees to protecting children from rabid dogs.

CARSON: If there's a rabid dog running around in your neighborhood, you're probably not going to assume something good about that dog.

LLAMAS (voice-over): And national security issues critical to 2016 candidates: our latest poll of Republicans shows terrorism now topping the economy as the most important issue for voters.

For Carson, only 6 percent of Republicans in the crucial state of Iowa believe he's best to handle foreign policy. Ted Cruz takes the lead at 24 percent. He's come out against sending U.S. ground troops to Syria.

SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: You asked about boots on the ground. The Kurds are our boots on the ground.

LLAMAS (voice-over): Donald Trump, meanwhile, wants more airpower in the fight against ISIS.

DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would bomb the (INAUDIBLE) out of them.

LLAMAS (voice-over): Trump says he's open to the idea of sending ground troops while others have been more definitive in their support, which ranges from limited intervention to large-scale deployment. For THIS WEEK, Tom Llamas, ABC News, New York.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

RADDATZ: And our thanks to Tom.

And Ben Carson joins us now from Amman, Jordan.

Good morning, Dr. Carson.

We'll get to your trip in a moment.

But first, your reaction to what happened in Colorado Springs.

CARSON: Well, obviously, you know, any hate crime is a horrible thing, no matter from where it comes, and should be condemned very strongly.

RADDATZ: Dr. Carson, the Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountains' Vicki Cowart said that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country.

Do you agree with that?

CARSON: Unfortunately, there's a lot of extremism coming from all areas. It's one of the biggest problems that I think is threatening to tear our country apart. We get into our separate corners and we hate each other; we want to destroy those with whom we disagree.

It comes from both sides. So, you know, there is -- there is no saint here in this -- in this equation.

But what we really have to start asking ourselves is, what can we do as a nation to rectify this situation?

How can we begin to engage in rational discussion?

You know, all you have to do is go to the -- an article on the Internet and go to the comments section; you don't get five comments down before people start calling each other names and acting like idiots, you know.

What happened to us?

What happened to the civility that used to characterize our society?

RADDATZ: And you are in Jordan right now and have had quite the trip to visit refugees.

What have you learned about refugees that you didn't know before?

CARSON: Well, you know, I was very pleasantly surprised that -- to see how welcoming they are.

I had an opportunity to talk to many of the Syrian refugees and ask them, what is your supreme desire?

And it was pretty uniform. They want to go back home, obviously.

And I said, what kinds of things could a nation like the United States do that would be helpful to you?

And, again, I was a little bit surprised with the answer, because it wasn't what we're hearing a lot. We're hearing that they all want to come here to the United States. And that's not what they want. They want to go back home.

But they said the United States and other nations could be much more supportive of the Herculean efforts manifested by the Jordanians in -- in taking in people at a lot of expense to themselves. And they cannot continue that without help from the international community.

You know, you look at last month, we spent $3 billion on Halloween candy. That's the amount of money that was needed to bridge the shortfall for a year that they're having in Jordan with the refugees.

RADDATZ: But, Dr. Carson...

CARSON: We should think about things like that.

RADDATZ: ...we -- we've spent more than $4 billion in humanitarian aid, about $668 million to Jordan for the refugees.

So what more could they possibly be doing?

CARSON: Well, you know, you have to go there and see for yourself. But you can see there are a lot of individual modules that they have created for these families. They're in the process of trying to get electricity all of them, getting plumbing to all of them and providing the kind of comforts facilities that make it a much more tolerable temporary refuge for them, until they can, in fact, get home.

But, you know, the solution for the refugees is already there. You know, and they're -- they've taken in millions of people. You know, for us to bring 10,000 or 25,000 people over here, that doesn't solve the problem.

I mean we need to look at real solutions for the problem and not things that make us feel good about ourselves.

RADDATZ: Dr. Carson, I actually have been to the refugee camps and particularly Zaatari, and found the same thing, they want to go either back to Syria, which doesn't look possible at this point, or they want to go somewhere else. They want jobs.

Do you welcome them into America now?

Has anything changed your mind?

CARSON: Well, when you say, you know, they want to escape the refugee camps, the main reason that any of them want to escape the refugee camps is because there's not adequate support there for them. If there were adequate support, it would be a completely different story.

RADDATZ: But -- but they don't want to...

CARSON: And we can provide that adequate support, so...

RADDATZ: ,,,stay there, Dr. Carson, do they?

The ones -- the people I talk to don't want to stay there...

CARSON: They don't want to stay there permanently...

RADDATZ: ...no matter what the support is.

CARSON: They want to -- they want to be repatriated into their own country. That's what they want.

And is that going to be easier from a neighboring country or is that going to be easier from the United States of America?

RADDATZ: Dr. Carson, by taking this trip in the middle of a campaign, are you acknowledging that you weren't quite prepared to be commander-in-chief?

CARSON: I'm acknowledging that I like to know what I'm talking about. You know, it's the same situation when I went this summer down to the border of Mexico. And, you know, I knew that there were problems there, but to be able to actually talk to the farmers who are being harassed and to the sheriffs and sheriffs' deputies who are frustrated after risking their lives and then being told by ICE, you must release these people, you get a much better impression seeing a fence with a big hole cut in it with a few strings of barbed wire across that people can easily go through, and that's a barrier?

You know, it's good to be able to see these things for yourself so you can actually begin to formulate the right kinds of policies with the real information.

RADDATZ: And -- and what are the right kinds of policies for those Syrian refugees?

Should America be taking some of those refugees?

CARSON: I believe that the right policy is to support the refugee program that is in place, that works that works extremely well but does not have adequate funding. If you do that, you solve that problem without exposing the American people to a population that could be infiltrated with terrorists who want to destroy us.

If you can eliminate the possibility of terrorists infiltrating them and wanting to destroy us, you have a different argument. But I don't see that being eliminated.

RADDATZ: Do -- do you think there were terrorists among those refugees who you talked to?

CARSON: I don't know whether there were or not. But I do know that the -- the ISIS terrorists have said that if we bring refugees, that they would infiltrate them.

And why wouldn't they?

RADDATZ: I want to ask you quickly about ISIS.

I was in Iraq last week and I was in the air combat control center.

Would you like to see the rules of engagement loosened?

One of the things they told me is they aim for zero civilian casualties and sole purpose ISIS structures.

Should that change?

CARSON: What I would really like to see is -- is an administration that really seriously sits down with our experts in that region and would ask them what is needed in order to accomplish our goal of eliminating this group of terrorists?

That's what I'd really like to see.

RADDATZ: So you don't know whether you'd want...

CARSON: But, you know, those of us who are not...

RADDATZ: ...those rules of engagement loosened?

CARSON: ...experts in that area -- those of us who are not experts in that area can sit around all day long talking about oh, we should do this and we should do that. But why don't we listen to the people who actually are the experts in that area, find out what it is that they need?

Then our decision should be is, do we really want to do that? Do we really want to give them what they need or do we want to continue playing around like we are?

RADDATZ: OK, thanks very much, Dr. Carson.

Much more ahead on 20 -- on 2016, including the candidate whose new video seems to be comparing Donald Trump to Hitler.

Plus, high alert with President Obama heading to that global summit in Paris and new revelations about an NFL legend that could change the future of the game.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RADDATZ: Coming up, the roundtable takes on 2016 and President Obama flying to Paris today. A live report from Jon Karl next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RADDATZ: Paris, a city on edge this morning. Police there yesterday guarding the first soccer match since the terror attacks and now 200 world leaders, including President Obama, set to arrive for a conference on climate change just two weeks after those ISIS terror attacks.

Let's bring in chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl, on the ground in Paris -- good morning, Jon.

JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Martha.

The effort to combat climate change is what is bringing all the world leaders here to Paris. But hanging over this entire summit is terrorism and the battle against ISIS.

President Obama has said the very fact that this summit is taking place just two weeks after the attacks that rocked this city is, quote, ""a powerful rebuke to the terrorists."" And according to President Hollande, this is the largest gathering of world leaders ever in Paris.

Security appears to be higher here than at any time since the end of World War II. Terrorism will be on the agenda when President Obama and Hollande have a one-on-one meeting over dinner tomorrow night.

Hollande is seeking unity and a stepped up effort against ISIS.

But in the wake of the shooting down of that Russian jet by Turkey last week, unity is a very tall order. Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan has refused to apologize, placing the blame on Russia for violating Turkish air space and Russia has slapped severe economic sanctions on Turkey.

One of the subplots here at this summit is Prime Minister Erdogan has asked for a meeting with Vladimir Putin. They will both be here. But so far, Putin has refused to even respond to that request -- Martha.

RADDATZ: Thanks, Jon.

Joining us now, Congressman Michael McCaul, chair of the Homeland Security Committee, and Adam Schiff, top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

I want to start with you, Chairman McCaul.

And I want to go back to this Colorado shooting.

Planned Parenthood is calling it domestic terrorism and saying extremists are feeding that environment.

Do you agree?

REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE: Well, I mean it's a tragedy. It's a -- we're seeing too many of these shootings, it seems like every week. It's a, I think, a mental health crisis. I don't think it -- it would fall under quite the definition of domestic terrorism, although I'll leave that to the Justice Department to make that determination.

But I do think we have to address mental health. And I think we also need to enforce existing law, which requires if you've been adjudicated mentally deficient that you have to be put on the list so you can't purchase a firearm. And what we found when I met with the New York Police Department is so many of these cases, like the Navy Yard shooter, never made it into the system. And I think that needs to be fixed.

RADDATZ: And do you think that will help, Congressman Schiff, that list?

How do you draw the line on -- on mental problems?

REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Well, I think this is a big issue that there's too ready access of people who are seriously mentally ill to firearms. But Martha, nothing we have done has worked because essentially we have done nothing. The background checks are not universal, so even if people who are mentally ill would be barred, if they buy it off the back of a truck or they buy it at a gun show, it's not going to stop them from getting a weapon. If they can still have access to very powerful weapons with extended ammunition clips, they're still going to be able to kill a lot of people.

We have to do something other than this routine now pantomime of condolence every time we have a mass shooting. That is simply not enough. And it's just unendurable.

RADDATZ: And I want to move to Paris and -- and the mass shooting there. They have somewhat lifted the imminent threat in Brussels. I was there. You feel very safe when the city is on lockdown, but they can't continue that.

What do you know now of the imminent threat in -- in Brussels in that area?

SCHIFF: I think the imminent threat is still very real and very present. There are a lot of people who are unaccounted for that pose a grave danger to people in both Belgium and France. And I think the reality is until Europe makes the decision to share information, to create a unified watch list, much like we have in this country, they either have to do that or they have to stop the free flow of people across their borders and within their borders, or it's not going to be a question of if there will be another Paris-style attack, only when.

RADDATZ: Chairman McCaul, what lessons have we learned from attacks in Paris?

MCCAUL: Well, there are several. The Paris attack were -- it's foreign fighters traveling to the region, coming back. So we have 5,000 Europeans with Western passports that have traveled to the region. Many have come back. We have hundreds of Americans and many of them have come back to the United States.

I do think the threat is far greater in Europe because of the numbers. There are far more foreign fighters traveling in and out of Europe to Iraq and Syria.

My committee issued a bipartisan task force report that the speaker and the leader now are implementing the recommendations and the legislation to help tighten up security gaps both internationally and domestic.

I think as Adam talked about, the ease of travel, they're -- they don't check their citizens past watch lists. I think a lot of that is going to change in the wake of the Paris attacks...

RADDATZ: And -- and what about here in the homeland, Chairman McCaul, what -- what do we really have to do?

You can't protect all these soft targets.

MCCAUL: Well, it's -- it's very difficult and -- and we don't want these foreign fighters coming into the United States from visa waiver countries. We've had, in the homeland, 18 plots stopped that were ISIS-related. We've arrested 70 ISIS followers. And we have 1,000 investigations in all 50 states.

So I think one thing Congress can do is we have an appropriations bill coming up in about two weeks. And I think the FBI and components of Homeland Security will need an increase in funding to help combat this threat that we see right in our homeland.

RADDATZ: Is that the answer, Congressman Schiff?

SCHIFF: Well, you know, we certainly have resource challenges, but we are fortunate that we don't have anywhere near the number of foreign fighters to track that Europe does. At the same time, I think two areas where we can really beef up our own security, one is a continuing vulnerability at our airports. All too often when we test the TSA, they don't meet the test, and that has to...

RADDATZ: And that was one of the things I was going to bring up, if we can talk about this quickly, shooting down of the Russian passenger jet -- or not shooting down, the explosion on board that, that we blame on ISIS. That is pretty incredibly. And we haven't talked about that a lot.

SCHIFF: It is incredible. And if you look at the device that ISIS claims to have used, it's no larger than the size of a soda can, that can bring down an entire plane.

RADDATZ: And you believe that's accurate?

SCHIFF: I believe that a device that small can bring down an aircraft. And that means we really have to tighten up our defenses.

And the other area I would mention, too, is while some have put a lot of focus on the refugees, by and large, the refugees have not been the problem. The real vulnerability here is people with European passports, European citizens that can travel without a visa to the United States. And we're going to have to address that issue.

RADDATZ: Thank you very much for joining us.

Up next, John Kasich taking on Donald Trump.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RADDATZ: Donald Trump's brand new firestorm this week and the candidate who is hitting back. John Kasich is here live.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RADDATZ: Back now to 2016 and Ohio Governor John Kasich who joins us from Columbus this morning. Good morning, Governor Kasich.

GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning, Martha.

RADDATZ: I want to start, governor, with Ben Carson and the Syrian refugees saying what we need to do is give more money to Jordan and other places to help those refugees out there. Is that the answer?

KASICH: Well, I don't mind if we give some humanitarian aid to the Jordanians or, you know, the Saudis if need be, but you know, I've been for this no-fly zone so that we can have a sanctuary for people to be safe. And it was the Kurds and perhaps the Jordanians who could defend the sanctuaries so the Syrians could feel safe in the sanctuary, but the president has done nothing. And he's created a very big void.

And Martha, as I mentioned earlier, the Russians have now deployed S-400 air defense system that not only threatens our ability to move around, but the Turks also have coverage in northern Israel, this is profound implications for the region, profound implications for us.

And we dither and we delay and it is just not working out. And frankly the president ought to be encouraging the president of Turkey and say we stand with him against the fact that the Russians invaded his airspace, but we've done nothing. And so the Russians have moved forward to deploy an air defense system that we, at this point, really can't penetrate and it limits our ability.

RADDATZ: Well, what would you do about that air defense system?

KASICH: Well, at this point -- I mean, you know, the only thing you can do with that air defense system is to take it out. And of course that's very serious. So you make it clear...

RADDATZ: You would take out a Russian air defense system?

KASICH: No, what I’m saying to you, Martha, that's all you can do right now, because we don't have the capability. No, I think that we should proceed with moving forward on a no-fly zone. And I think we should proceed by putting boots on the ground and a coalition with Europeans and with our friends in the Middle East like we had in the first Gulf War to destroy ISIS once and for all.

But I have to tell you...

RADDATZ: You called for boots on the ground before. You're talking about an invading force, an occupying force, give us more specifics.

KASICH: No, I'm not talking about an occupying force, I'm talking about a coalition that looks awfully like the coalition we had in the first Gulf War. It would involve our friends in the Middle East who want to contribute, also to our NATO allies, because we're not going to solve this problem with ISIS by just sitting back and delaying or dithering, which is what we've done.

And the longer we do this -- we did not support the Syrian rebels in the beginning, so Assad survives. We did not create the no-fly zones. And now all of a sudden, not only are the Russians there, but they're there with a very strong air defense system that not only could potentially limit what we do, but also of course threatens the northern part of Israel and Turkey. I mean, it's just amazing what's happening.

This is reminiscent -- yeah, this is reminiscent of what happened when Jimmy Carter showed weakness to the Russians all the way back in the late-70s. It's a very serious problem, Martha.

RADDATZ: Governor Kasich, I want to move to the campaign and Donald Trump, your campaign has a new ad out that is stirring a lot of controversy. Let's listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If he keeps going and he actually becomes president, he might just get around to you and you better hope that there's someone left to help you.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

RADDATZ: OK, you're referencing the famous anti-Nazi poem ""First They Came For."" The ad appears to compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Is that the comparison?

KASICH: No, Martha, this is Colonel Tom Moe, he was a POW for five years in North Vietnam, was beaten and tortured and came within an inch of losing his own life. And these are his words. He feels very strongly about a man who divides us. And as you know, Martha...

RADDATZ: But it is your ad.

KASICH: Well, but it's his words. And we -- look, it's about whether we want to have a leader who unifies the country. I mean, Trump has criticized and insulted women, Hispanics, Muslims and reporters. In addition to that, he was picking on...

RADDATZ: Do you believe what Donald Trump is saying that he didn't know he was insulting the reporter?

KASICH: Well, he's insulted other reporters. This one he absolutely mocked, who was disabled.

Martha, I know you're a fan of (INAUDIBLE). We all are. We need a leader that brings us together, not a leader that's separating us, one group from another.

RADDATZ: Does that mean you would not support him if he were the nominee?

KASICH: Well, he's not going to be the nominee, Martha, because, at the end, look, he may have 20 percent of the vote. But he's got 80 percent of Republicans who don't support him. And somebody has to call him out on this kind of divisive language --

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: But answer that question. You say he won't get the nomination.

But if he does, will you support him?

KASICH: He's not going to. So we're not even going to go there. But I tell you this --

RADDATZ: So would you support him, Governor Kasich, if he is the Republican nominee?

After what you've just said about him?

KASICH: I think he's very divisive and I do not believe he will last, Martha. I know all the press keeps speculating on what he's going to do; you all said he was going to fall, then he didn't. Now you're, you know, all, you know, you're all, you know, up in the air about, well, maybe he's going to make it.

He's not going to make it, Martha.

You know why he's not going to make it?

Because somebody who divides this country here in the 21st century, who's calling names of women and Muslims and Hispanics and mocking reporters, then say I didn't do it but he did do it, it's just not going to happen, Martha. And everybody needs to get over it and take a deep breath.

At the end of the day, we have serious problems --

RADDATZ: OK, Governor Kasich, I'm going to have to -- I'm going to have to wrap it up here. We talked about foreign affairs quite a bit. We really appreciate your joining us this morning.

KASICH: But I wish you were in the race, Martha. I'd (INAUDIBLE) for you if you were the nominee.

RADDATZ: Oh, that would be a disaster.

(LAUGHTER)

RADDATZ: OK, next on this Thanksgiving football weekend the surprising revelation about a gridiron icon: could it change the game?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: I would never mock a person that has a difficulty. I would never do that. I'm telling you. I would never do it. I would never do it.

I would never do it.

I don't care if I liked the person or didn't. And I don't know this person.

RADDATZ: Donald Trump there, defending himself, saying he didn't make fun of a disabled ""New York Times"" reporter. And the ""Powerhouse Roundtable"" is here, ""Weekly Standard"" editor Bill Kristol; Democratic strategist Maria Cardona; Matt Bai, national political columnist for Yahoo! News and ABC's Cokie Roberts.

Cokie Roberts, do you believe him and does it matter?

COKIE ROBERTS, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Nothing seems to matter in terms of his voters. His base voters basically say whatever he says is fine.

I don’t -- I think it was important that John Kasich is now beginning to call him out. It's about time that others in the Republican field start to say the emperor has no clothes and that is the case, of course.

RADDATZ: Is that the case, Bill Kristol?

BILL KRISTOL, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": The case is Donald Trump isn't telling the truth and he clearly knew what he was doing when he mocked ""The New York Times"" reporter and then he pretended he hadn't known him.

Then he makes a pseudo-apology, which (INAUDIBLE) --

(LAUGHTER)

(CROSSTALK)

MATT BAI, YAHOO! NEWS: This is the thing, Martha, this is the thing that amazes me -- he used the word ""amazing,"" right, about Trump, right, because we all get that he shoots from the hip. We all get that he said he's a straight talker, he says what he wants, whatever it is --

(CROSSTALK)

BAI: -- he wants to pass himself off as. He has absolutely zero capacity. He has demonstrated zero capacity in this campaign to say I'm sorry, to apologize for any of the things that he says. I think that could be -- to me, that's disqualifying in a leader. If you can't even reflect on the things you say in the heat of the moment when you're as rash as he is to sometimes say, you know, I misspoke, I shouldn't have done that, he's never said --

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: -- and the latest FOX News poll shows he's viewed 41 percent honest, 55 percent not honest. But it doesn’t seem to matter.

MARIA CARDONA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yes, and I think that is probably the worst part of this for Republicans because it doesn’t seem to matter to his voters.

And in fact, when he does double down on his lies and his untruths, when he blames the media for any misstatements they think that he has made, it makes his voters that much more fervent about support him.

ROBERTS: But Kasich is right. He doesn’t have the majority of Republican voters.

RADDATZ: But he seems to be -- Kasich seems to be the one taking on Trump now. It didn't work so well for Bobby Jindal --

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: -- it's not going to work for them, either.

And Cruz, Ted Cruz has taken the other side. The latest polls, Cruz is number two in Iowa with 23 percent in the Quinnipiac poll, just behind Trump at 25 percent; he will not attack Trump.

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: Where does that go?

ROBERTS: I think he could go all the way for Ted Cruz. He is very much sailing in Trump's wake and hoping that Trump will fall and that the voters will come to him. So he's doing nothing to alienate them. And he's a serious candidate. He's somebody who took on the establishment in Texas and won and represents Texas in the Senate, big state. I mean, he could -- he could make it.

KRISTOL: And we just can't underestimate -- this is the reason why the elected officials take on Trump and it doesn’t help and, in fact, it helps Trump in a way, because people have a deep distrust of our elected officials, confidence and honesty and in some ways, frankly, after the last decade, you'd say having a distrust in political elites and financial elites is warranted.

I mean, look at the four leading candidates for Republican nomination, two people who've never held elected office -- Donald Trump and Ben Carson -- and two first-term senators. All these governors who've been in office for -- well, in Rick Perry's case, 14 years and others' case, people's case is two terms, Jeb Bush, all, by the way, side. We'll see if one of them can make a bit of a run; maybe Christie can.

But it is striking -- I just think we keep underestimating -- and I have, too.

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: I agree he just got that New Hampshire union or the Manchester union leader endorsement.

CARDONA: That's right. Well, I think if at any time that kind of endorsement is going to help, it is now. But here's a --

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: -- Newt Gingrich last time.

(LAUGHTER)

CARDONA: Well, exactly. And so what I was going to say is probably this cycle, more than any other, what the media says doesn’t matter. And in fact, could hurt a candidate in this primary process.

At this point, I don't see a path where Donald Trump probably doesn’t become the nominee. And I --

KRISTOL: Oh, that's nonsense.

(LAUGHTER)

(CROSSTALK)

CARDONA: -- and that may be true. But --

RADDATZ: (INAUDIBLE).

CARDONA: -- but what can he say that he hasn't said before that will make his --

(CROSSTALK)

CARDONA: -- no one else drops out and he starts gaining --

(CROSSTALK)

ROBERTS: -- make a difference. The super PACs make it possible --

(CROSSTALK)

BAI: -- no, the question, look, we know what we've got with Trump now. You have an inelastic base of support that maybe 25-30 percent of the party -- he couldn't shake that if he went out and, you know, killed a bunch of people today.

The question is -- the question is, you know, can he grow it?

He's shown no capacity to grow it and I think the things he's done in the last couple months make that impossible. So the -- so what you're really looking at is -- the question you have to ask yourself is can the governing establishment of the Republican Party at this point be like the Tea Party in 2012, in which they just remained split, choose a bunch of different candidates in different states and can't coalesce?

That's the scenario under which you're talking --

CARDONA: That's right.

BAI: -- that you're talking about. I don't think establishments behave that way. I think ultimately, they do congeal around one or two candidates. And if that's the case, they will eclipse Donald Trump because he can't grow 25 or 30 percent in the election...

(CROSSTALK)

RADDATZ: I want to...

CARDONA: -- anything that we've seen before.

RADDATZ: I want to talk about Ben Carson. You heard Ben Carson in Jordan meeting with refugees. Before the Paris attacks, you wrote that you regretted having been so dismissive of the Carson candidacy. He has the qualities of mind and soul sorely missed in recent public life.""

Do you still feel the same way?

KRISTOL: I do. I also say in that editorial that I probably wouldn't vote for him for president. I prefer one of the more conventionally qualified candidates. But I regretted lumping Carson with Trump. I said neither was qualified to be president about two months ago.

I think Trump is, in my opinion -- I mean I feel I've come to kind of loathe Donald Trump, whereas I like...

(LAUGHTER)

KRISTOL: -- I like and admire Ben Carson. He probably shouldn't be president of the United States, but he's a decent human being and I thought the interview showed that, incidentally. He went over to Jordan. He's trying to think things through. His recommendations of sending more aid to help the refugee camps in Jordan and being wary about letting Syrians come into the U.S. isn't crazy, after all.

And so I'm -- I'm pro-Carson and anti-Trump.

But I think ultimately Carson won't be the nominee either...

CARDONA: And do you know what...

KRISTOL: -- which does raise the question to Cokie's point about Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio...

CARDONA: Right.

KRISTOL: -- Chris Christie, one of them is more likely...

ROBERTS: Well, and then...

KRISTOL: -- to be the nominee.

ROBERTS: -- and Chris Christie, regardless of the ""Manchester Union-Leader,"" is in a little moment because of what happened in Paris. And -- and terrorism, once it becomes the primary issue, it really does sink everything else, because if people don't feel safe, nothing else matters, so.

BAI: Well, he's also the best pure...

(CROSSTALK)

BAI: -- he's the best pure...

RADDATZ: Very quickly, Matt.

BAI: -- retail candidate in the field. And that's why I think ""The Union Leader"" endorsement does matter at this point, because I think the establishment does have to congeal somewhere and he's got a lot of strengths as a candidate.

RADDATZ: OK, as you can tell, we're running out of time, so we'll let you guys go.

Thank you.

But we'll still ask the Powerhouse Puzzler for those of you at home and that's President Obama there conducting the presidential turkey pardon. The names of this year's pardoned turkeys pay homage to our 16th president.

Can you guess either of the names?

The answer after this from our ABC stations.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RADDATZ: Thanks for joining us, Chris.

(INAUDIBLE) the pardoned turkeys?

The answer, Honest and Abe.

Now to that surprise revelation about a football legend. Hall of Famer and former ""Monday Night Football"" analyst Frank Gifford died of natural causes in August, but a team of pathologists this week saying Gifford had CTE, a disease resulting from brain tumor that is detectable only after death.

The Gifford family saying our suspicions that he was suffering from the debilitating effects of head trauma were confirmed.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell saying, ""We are not waiting until science provides all the answers, we are working now to improve the safety of our game.""

Still, CTE and the effects of head injuries on players has had a big impact on the league.

So what will be the impact of these new revelations?

Let's bring in ""USA Today"" columnist, Christine Brennan, and Chris Nowinski, executive director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation.

And Christine, I want to start with you.

You wrote in your column this week that ""A national conversation we all should be having about concussions will come easier now because of Frank Gifford.""

Why -- why does this change the conversation?

CHRISTINE BRENNAN, ""USA TODAY""/ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Because he's a national name that crosses over from sports, Martha, into our culture, the same way that the HIV and AIDS issue with Rock Hudson and then Magic Johnson, that that conversation was advanced, or Parkinson's with Michael J. Foxx, addiction with Betty Ford.

Very different issues all. But the common theme there is a big name that crosses into all households...

RADDATZ: People can really identify.

BRENNAN: -- and -- and you can say now Frank Gifford had this?

Everyone knows Frank Gifford. There's not a name that -- a person who doesn't know him in a way that a football name, just a football player, Frank crossed over into our lives in a big way.

RADDATZ: Chris, I saw you listening to the quote from Roger Goodell, saying we're not going to wait for science, we're going to make the game safer.

You've said over and over and over again that the NFL is too powerful.

Will this change anything for them?

CHRIS NOWINSKI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CONCUSSION LEGACY FOUNDATION: Well, I don't think it will change much for the NFL. But the big conversation we need to have is if this -- football is causing this disease, which it is, and it's a dose response relationship, the longer you play, the more times you're hit in the head, the younger you start, we really have to look at youth football.

And the problem is while the NFL is making some moves to their game, they can't make the youth game safe. And yet they're marketing it to so many children. They're spending tens of millions of dollars to get our kids to play when we really should be getting our kids to get out of it.

RADDATZ: You played football. You played high school, college...

NOWINSKI: Yes.

RADDATZ: -- and you've said you feel you have some effects of it.

NOWINSKI: Oh, absolutely. I had to re--- I -- I still have Post-Concussion Syndrome. I likely have CTE. I mean you know, we -- I'm really motivated that we -- our researchers can find a way to diagnose this in living people and treat it, because there's a lot of guys like me, that are dealing with these issues.

RADDATZ: And Christine, I interviewed recently the head of the health program for the NFL, the chief doctor at the NFL, Dr. Elizabeth Nabel. She was going through what we do for concussions and you pull them out at this time and you -- I have to say, I keep thinking but we don't really know that much about concussions, do we?

So are you comfortable with that at all...

BRENNAN: I...

RADDATZ: -- what they're doing now?

BRENNAN: Well, it's better than they -- what they were doing before, although last week, there was a quarterback who kept playing with a concussion and that -- they had a conference call to make sure they got the protocol right. So this is still a work in progress.

It's not just football, though the NFL and football, to Chris's point, is a huge piece of it, girls and women's soccer, it's a huge issue there.

See, it's a big issue with our youth sports.

I wonder in 50 years, will we have football?

We're going to have it for the next 10, 15, 20, 30, probably.

But 50 years?

I don't know.

And to Chris's point, what happens with those kids, especially maybe the suburban kids or whatever?

Will they choose football or will they go to other sports because moms and dads will say that we're worried about this for our kids?

RADDATZ: And very quickly, Chris, do you think we should have football?

Do you think we should have football in 50 years?

NOWINSKI: I don't think it should be for children. No way we should be hitting kids in the head hundreds of times before high school for any reason whatsoever.

RADDATZ: And Dr. Nabel said she thinks there will be a trickle-down effect.

Do you think there will be?

NOWINSKI: I -- not really.

RADDATZ: That will help the kids.

NOWINSKI: There's only so much we can do. There's only so much we can do to help kids in a sport like football, when you're hitting them so much and they're too young to even understand they have a concussion. No, I mean and concussion isn't really the issue. It's the hundreds of hits to the head is terrible for any childhood brain.

RADDATZ: OK. Thanks very much to both of you.

It's something we've talked about many times and we'll probably talk about many times coming up.

That's all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Check out ""WORLD NEWS TONIGHT."" And we'll see you back here next week.

Tonight a counter message in the halls of Harvard law. Faculty portraits that had been defaced overnight are now decorated with colorful messages of love and support. Really beautiful to see it. Sunni examples. That caught at slip right now I'm and I also thing it's important to show. Students of color and everyone in the community of active hate gender expression. Races and other forms of action won't go on and university officials say campus police are investigating this as a hate crime. Black tape placed across the photographs of black professors hanging in the Wasserstein lecture hall. In the statement the dean of Harvard law wrote expressions of hate are important whether they be directed at race sex sexual preference gender identity religion or any other targets of bigotry but some students told us the university was too slow to condemn the hateful act that it was students who pressured administrators this morning to Alter their schedules and make time to discuss the incident. In the meantime students took action themselves posting notes to their professors like these. This one really it's amazing professor mentor and role model and this one you are brilliant and loan.

Students shared photos of the defacement -- which comes as several schools have faced recent racial turbulence on campus -- on social media Thursday morning.

While the identity of the perpetrator is unknown, Leland Shelton, president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, said he believed the crime was committed by a ""coward.""

""[This person] wasn’t brave enough to say these types of things in a classroom discussion, to raise [his or her] racist ideas. [He or she] crept in the middle of the night and did this.""

Harvard police would not comment beyond confirming that a hate crime investigation was underway, according to spokesman Steven Catalano.

The law school's dean, Martha Minow said in a statement the school is determined to ""improve the community.""

""Expressions of hatred are abhorrent, whether they be directed at race, sex, sexual preference, gender identity, religion, or any other targets of bigotry,"" she said.

More than 300 concerned students, faculty and staff met Thursday at noon to discuss the incident after students pressured the administration, Shelton said in a statement.

""Recent events at the University of Missouri, Yale, and campuses across the country remind us that racism persists and encourages us to continue to fight with a sense of urgency for meaningful change in our institutions and in our country,"" Shelton said.

Prior to the defacement, HLS students participated in a ""Day of Activism"" with neighboring universities to stand in solidarity with black college activists nationwide.

Ronald Sullivan, clinical professor of law at HLS, had his portrait defaced. The director of the Criminal Justice Institute said the incident exposed what he said were underlying issues at Harvard.

""It is some form of erasure and I can really empathize with the students,"" he said. ""I knew I'd be fine but they don't feel that their voices are at all valued. It was symbolic: we don’t value you, we don't value people that look like you.""

""We need people literally from all walks of life to enter this discussion and we need folks out there disagreeing,"" Strickland said.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/year-boy-donates-money-piggy-bank-mosque-vandalized/story?id=35291105,"A 7-year-old boy recently donated all the money in his piggy bank to a Texas mosque that was vandalized in what police are saying is a hate crime, an official from the house of worship said.

The Islamic Center of Pflugerville was hit by a vandal who left torn pages of the Koran smeared with feces outside the entrance, police said. The vandalism was found early Monday morning by a congregant.

The young donor, Jack Swanson, went to the mosque that afternoon and handed over his money -- $20 that had originally been collected in the form of pennies over time, according to Faisal Naeem, one of the mosque's board members.

""Jack's $20 are worth $20 million to us because it's the thought that counts,"" Naeem told ABC News today. ""Jack is just a little older than my son, Ibrahim. If we have more kind-hearted kids like them in the world, I have hope for our future.""

KVUE

Although no physical damage was made to the facility, clean-up costs were estimated to be about $150, a mosque member told police.

Jack's mother, Laura Swanson, told ABC affiliate KVUE that she wanted to support the mosque and show that ""what happened in Paris is not what's happening in Pflugerville.""

Naeem added that he didn't want to assume the vandalism was motivated by news of the Paris terror attacks until police conclude their investigation. However, he said he was frustrated that such ""generalizations"" are often applied to the Muslim community after extremist attacks.

""It's become so commonplace where something goes wrong somewhere and people want to blame all Muslims,"" he said. ""If anything, it's a pointing indictment of the logical fallacy in our society's way of thinking.""

Nonetheless, Naeem said the mosque remains encouraged by the local community's outpouring of support since the vandalism.

And we're joined by Pierre Thomas, who's been working his sources all evening. Give us the latest. Tonight, law enforcement has begun the hunt for clues. They need to know right now. The question tonight, who did it? On the short list, Al Qaeda and Isis. Just last January, there was a spree of terror in France. Two brothers forcing their way into the offices of ""Charlie hebdo"" in Paris. And Al Qaeda, claiming responsibility for the assault, saying that one of the brothers had received training from them. And another man, killed after police stormed a supermarket. His partner, believed to have fled to Syria. This is very similar to attacks in the fast from Al Qaeda and Isis. It wouldn't surprise me if it was either an Al Qaeda affiliate or Isis. Reporter: And most recently fixated on blowing up commercial airplanes. And Al Qaeda has been working on a so-called undetectable bomb. But authorities don't believe their blood lust is confined to just aviation. Remember the attack in 2008? A series of attacks over a series of nightmarish hours. But Isis, consuming huge swaths of land, forming the so-called islamic state. And a social media campaign unprecedented. More than 1,500 French citizens affiliated with Isis, a quarter of the european total. This past July, this video threatening that the group will bring slaughter to France. Many first came to the country following the colonial wars of independent in the countries of Algeria and Tunisia. In 1961, the French police shot and killed some 200 pro-algerian demonstrators. Today, the suburbs of Paris have a Muslim population center. Hot beds of unrest. And individuals coming and assimilating into the French culture. Department 93, a large group that feels cut off from French society. And 60% estimated of prisoners are affiliated. One of the challenges that will be faced is stopping hate crimes. U.s. Officials have been concerned about Al Qaeda bombers, Isis, and so-called lone wolves. The pressure incredible, as they have to worry about all scenarios. And joined by Brian Ross. The big debate beginning after the attacks, Al Qaeda, Isis. What are your sources telling us? Well, the main focus is Isis. More than 1,000 sympathizers. And just a wealth of people who would be available. And recently, threats from Isis in social media to bring slaughter to the streets of Paris. And what do you make of the reports that some were yelling Syria in the theater? Well, they have the DNA and fingerprints of the attackers. So, we'll know much more tomorrow.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-sentenced-80-years-pure-evil-acts-enslaving/story?id=35005507,"A Philadelphia woman was sentenced today to 80 years in prison for kidnapping mentally disabled people, keeping them prisoner in her basement, and starving at least two of them to death. Prosecutors said the woman and her cohorts drugged, beat and abused their captives, and forced them to sign over their Social Security disability checks and state benefits.

Linda Weston, 55, pleaded guilty to all charges today in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Four people were found being held captive in her small Philadelphia basement when she was arrested in October 2011, authorities said, noting that one of the captives was Weston’s own 19-year-old niece, Beatrice, who was found malnourished and suffering from cuts and wounds. At least six disabled adults and four children were victimized, authorities said, and two of the adults died while in captivity.

According to court documents, Weston targeted mentally challenged people who were estranged from their families, first befriending them and offering them a place to stay. Once the victims moved in, Weston and two co-conspirators confined them to locked rooms, basements, closets, attics and apartments, prosecutors said. While confined, the captives were often isolated in the dark and sedated with drugs that Weston and other defendants placed in their food and drink, prosecutors said. If the prisoners protested, Weston and two other would punish them by “slapping, punching, kicking, stabbing, burning and hitting them with closed hands, belts, sticks, bats and hammers or other objects, including the butt of a pistol,"" prosecutors said.

When Philadelphia police first uncovered the plot, Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey called it “pure evil.”

Ron Cortes/AP Photo

Prosecutors said Weston was the ringleader, and ran her scheme from 2001 to 2011 in Florida, Virginia and Philadelphia -- moving on to another state after one of her prisoners died from starvation or abuse.

Court documents detailed the stories of two victims: Donna Spadea was limited to a substandard diet and prohibited from using the bathroom in the Philadelphia home, where Weston held her captive. On June 26, 2005, she was found dead in the home’s basement, authorities said, but Weston moved her body to another part of the house before calling police. Another victim, Maxine Lee, was kept in a kitchen cabinet and confined to an attic for several months before she succumbed to bacterial meningitis and starvation in November 2008, prosecutors said.

Ron Cortes/AP Photo

Weston’s long list of crimes are reflected in the charges she pleaded guilty to today -- racketeering conspiracy, kidnapping resulting in the death of the victim, forced human labor, involuntary servitude, multiple counts of murder in aid of racketeering, hate crime, violent crime in aid of racketeering, sex trafficking, kidnapping, theft of government funds, wire fraud, mail fraud, use of a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime and false statements.

In addition to the 80 year prison term, U.S. District Court Judge Cynthia M. Rufe of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ordered Weston to pay restitution of $273,463 to the Social Security Administration and a $19,600 special assessment.",abcnews.com,True

Reporter: Hey, good morning, George. I want to show you some of the damage. The front of this church completely blackened by the flames. Son-in-law of the siding even melting from the building. Authorities believe one person may be responsible for all of the incidents. This morning, investigators are scrambling searching for a serial arsonist believed to be responsible for setting fires to at least six churches. The churches targeted all just outside St. Louis located within three miles of each other. Each fire starting at the front doors, each one set in the dead of night. It is arson. These are being intentionally set. Reporter: Though different denominations the congregations mostly black complicated racial tensions in an area still recovering from the riots following the 2014 police involved shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael brown. This church forced to hold services on their front lawn because of fire damage to the building. Very similar type fires, so they are very suspicious. It could be considered a hate crime. Reporter: And authorities now this morning hoping someone who saw something may help lead them to an arrest.

DeAndre Smith, who identified herself as Zella Ziona, was shot Thursday while in a service alley behind a shopping center in Montgomery Village, about 25 miles north of Washington D.C., the Montgomery County Police said.

Ziona, 21, died from several gunshot wounds, police said.

Rico Hector Leblond, 20, was arrested in connection with Ziona's murder Friday night, according to police.

""Investigators learned that Ziona and Leblond knew each other and had some degree of friendship prior to Ziona’s murder,"" the police said in a news release.

The police aren't elaborating on their friendship at this time, Montgomery County Police Capt. Paul Starks told ABC News today.

""This is a horrific crime and a tragedy for those who knew Zella,"" Montgomery County Police Chief J. Thomas Manger said in a statement released before Leblond's arrest. ""As with all homicides in Montgomery County, we have detectives working around the clock to thoroughly and completely investigate this murder.""

Leblond has been charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bond, police said.

When asked about possible additional charges, including a hate crime charge, Starks told ABC News: ""Investigators have to look at more of the circumstances. And then they will meet with members of our state's attorney's office and a decision about a hate crime charge will be made at that point.""

Jenkins is at least the 20th trans woman killed in the United States this year -- and the 18th trans woman of color, according to a report and statement published by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation (HCR) in partnership with the Trans People of Color Coalition (TPOCC).

The HCR and TPOCC are LGBTQ+ advocacy groups that have been working together since the beginning of the year to keep a running record of the violence transgender people face.

Jenkins was attacked and beaten by five to six unidentified men early Tuesday around 2:30 a.m., shortly after she was dropped off near Hunting Park, a Philadelphia Police Department spokesman told ABC News today.

Police believe one of the attackers pulled a gun and fired two shots into Jenkins' back while she was on the ground.

She was unresponsive when police and medics arrived and was pronounced dead at the Einstein Medical Center at 2:53 a.m., police said, adding that the suspects are still at large and police are looking at all possible motives, including the possibility that her gender identity may have played a role in her killing.

Jenkins' death has sparked an outcry from the transgender community and advocates, including the HRC, which said in a statement that more action must be taken to address ""what has become a nationwide epidemic of anti-transgender violence.""

""Even in a moment of unprecedented visibility for transgender people, their right to simply live authentically is threatened daily by violence, with countless unreported or unseen cases falling behind scattered headlines,"" Judy Shepard wrote in an op-ed co-written with HRC President Chad Griffin for its website.

Shepard is the mother of Matthew Shepard, a gay man whose murder in 1988 ""became a rallying cry for LGBT advocates around issues of bias-motivated violence,"" the HRC said.

Shepard's death, along with the murder of James Byrd Jr., a black man killed by white supremacists, led to the passage of a federal hate crimes prevention act in 2009, which extends a previously enacted law to include crimes based on gender, sexual orientation or disability.

Though Jenkins identified as a woman and used the pronouns ""she"" and ""her"" on her personal Facebook page, her sister Ronnia Jenkins told ABC News that their family didn't think she was transgender. Ronnia said Keisha went by ""Stephen Jenkins and was a boy"" most of the time when with the family ""and only dressed like a girl sometimes.""

""[She] was loving, caring and joking,"" Ronnia Jenkins said. ""[She] loved to draw, and [she] was an artist. We'll miss [her].""

Keisha Jenkins' death is also being mourned by high-profile transgender celebrities and advocates.

""Another tragic loss,"" New York Times bestselling author and T.V. show host Janet Mock tweeted. ""The state of emergency on black & Latina trans women's lives is real. #GirlsLikeUs""",abcnews.com,True

Hi this is Charley James of ABC news did you at all we are in Pennsylvania at the Franklin institute. Pennsylvania and Billy are really excited about the Pope coming to visit here in just a couple of weeks and one of the many examples of that is this. Lego Vatican end here at the Franklin institute. And we are lucky enough to have father Bob Simon he would is the designer and builder of the Lego Vatican. Which is drying so many visitors here at the three time and fit yet. Let's take a little tour of this and tell us just. And this idea. Little boys lovely one to two become priests. It is building churches and even as the seventh grader had built the Vatican. When summer of much more crude version this was. To listen I started with the facade. And I just looked it photos. Very patiently painstakingly. Lifted at one doorway at a time. One balcony at a time when window at a time. And again to replicate. Was excited that everything seemed to come out better than I that I expected it. So let's talk some numbers here how many pieces how long that this tape you know. It took me ten months ago of adults Waco convention prepare Virginia. And I thought I was buying white put slots the white brick through about two years I thought I had plenty cotton and realize that I had that nearly enough. I think it's a fair estimate that there's about 500000. Bricks are so if they at least did here. I do know that all these cobblestones. In Saint Peter's Square they have their looms slaying. 44000. Of those I had about winning. More than enough. Realized it was less than half of what I needed. Same thing happened to be with the columns for the holidays. There's 6000. Do so bricks that knows I had about half of that have been realized it was a nearly enough. And so let's talk about some of these specific pieces so all of these pieces that we're seeing all of the figure in. Are. Where belts are you created that of original Lego pieces that backtracked. Right a lot of them are from Lagos that sob various cities that sort of the Lego Hamas rulers. That are available. Three story buildings. And as I was collecting votes they realize. From. The Vatican being a place I love and having bitten it several times and knew I needed nuns that I needed to find some Lego nuns and priests and cardinals and and bishops of things though of that sort as well. And so we've got them up packet of a group of nuns over here can you just tell us what the key says. Where did you get these pieces from. The head chances say is a Star Wars please. Two types of addresses the values. Both from Star Wars they seemed the only thing really available. And then it's just a plain black torso. And a black smoke fumes that is often use. By late go to show somebody wearing lycra dress there while. And defined and it hasn't what looks like a bit that you set at that they need it big pertinent. That I used. You know part of the traditional nun's habit. But he took pieces from all kinds of different that Star Wars or seventies that skewed too great experience but there aren't too. Special pieces that are original. You punish. One is clearly on in this process. From the minds of junior high schools that is different than mine from high school. He made this constant figure out. Only problem with that is the totally gray here. There when he made this little priest to represent himself I place myself. Detroit the fact that Olson that's taking it all again. But the other constant that you wouldn't invite youth minister from my and it's the Pope Francis. Couldn't figure right about. That came from a little light understand mom and pop operation of Lago fans in the united. And so we've you brought this. Here you didn't create that here how did you transport you originally showed it at elect a convention but right. It transports. The facade. Is one that's the largest piece and then leave the dome. There's a piece that they just sat on the floor of a man thank heaven was. Make the move of the walls breaking into of the church. Break into about twelve pieces and the roof into for a flat pieces of course we'll. The call an aide had to be built here outside. Have the pieces spots carefully. And then the the plates they would lose lose cobblestones. They were stacked up about recruited it's together but many of the the cobblestone. Children and replace right here on site so it took about two full day. Throughout this that this they're on side. And viewers you should know that there is no glue involved or if he saw the Lego movie what they call crack hope that the that nothing include doubt is that considered in the lake a building where all this. Kind of cheating if you are if you tea fragile freeze government. I think a lot of adult go to settle myself. It's sort of round gluing them they could only be used for that purpose. You know maybe there's something exciting about the risk. It you know it stay together. And it's it's really nice and realistic in a way how you used all kinds of different figurines. And what I really love him. The the figure in that are holding up. That are holding up cell phone. Video of a number of them including a non that's holding up the cellphone if we look over here and so there is none here. What are the I enjoyed like the Vatican itself is is bringing tradition and you know ritual than. In this incredible place together with the modern world so showing. That's maybe epitomized and then done with Smartphone. You know and in front of her but it also seems to be directories that whether is eyewitness the rate master. Bringing me. Facility designed to pollinate wanted to do his vision he wanted to show the pollinate to be like the arms of a mother embracing the world. You know it it's so great welcome to leverage one of France's. Seems to a live. That out flesh that out so well for us. Tune. Transit will be coming season minivans are perfect and I don't think Slobodan. That he realized that. Want to point out to our viewers is that you mentioned that you've been a big leg up Anthony Stewart head. And are actually you tried to build days many Vatican when your child is love track that's. And there are few pieces here you can point them out for us that are actually from. Your childhood. With snow. At the top of the jobless. As I noticed about the little more yellow. Then the other pieces of the obelisk but it's right under their crimes and that I think it was a stop sign when I was a little boy. And the top heart broke off may be deliberately sought you know so that I could use that as the cap for the jobless. And then on the facade. There are some yellow wrecks that iron are present on the facade. And those yellow brick sight there because it's a very old building a monumental ancient building. There were also there because there is attempting on those lower levels. But they're there because a sentimental reasons for me there the yellow bricks from when I was little polite and included and then finally. Some of the priest figures. That this collar is simply a little sticker that. Its allies made little priest many figures when I was a polite. And actually. Some of the Lagos that I had. From when I was a bloody when I when I went to refurbish some of those there was still a little lot sticky spot. I'm black torso from the Holler I made on that Lago as as a child.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/emmett-tills-life-matters-60-years-brutal-slaying/story?id=33386573,"Today marks 60 years since Chicago teenager Emmett Till was killed at age 14 for apparently whistling at a white woman in Mississippi.

Civil rights activists, relatives of the black teen and other families ""victimized by racial violence"" -- including the family of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown -- have invited the public to unite for a commemorative weekend in Chicago to remember Till and to continue the legacy of Till's mother, Mamie Till Mobley.

""As I travel across the country supporting families who have lost their loved ones through hate crimes, I realized that Mamie lived her life fighting for our youth and fighting for Emmett’s legacy,” Till's cousin Airicka Gordon Taylor, said in a news release. ""This is why we have decided to host the Commemoration. This moment is for Mamie and all that she sacrificed. This is for Emmett, the sacrificial lamb whose death changed the course of the Civil Rights Movement.""

After her son was brutally killed -- found with a bullet hole in his head, barbed wire wrapped around his neck and a cotton gin fan weighing him down -- Mobley insisted on an open-casket funeral in Chicago. The shocking image sparked a louder call for civil rights, and Mobley, who died 12 years ago, spent her life working and encouraging young people to challenge injustice after her son was killed.

Though it has been 60 years since Till's killing, his killing still resonates with other families of color in the United States today, including the relatives of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, both black teens who were fatally shot by white men.

AP

Like the men who were charged with killing Till, Martin's and Brown's killers were found not guilty of the crimes with which they were charged.

In September 1955, an all-white, all-male jury in Sumner, Mississippi, acquitted the two white men charged in Till's slaying — J.W. Milam and his half brother, Roy Bryant, the husband of Carolyn Bryant, the woman at whom Till purportedly whistled.

In July of 2013, a Seminole County, Florida, jury acquitted George Zimmerman, the man who fatally shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who Zimmerman claimed violently confronted him.

During November of last year, a St. Louis County grand jury said they decided not to indict former Ferguson Police Department officer Darren Wilson, who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who Wilson claimed grabbed his gun. This past March, the U.S. Department of Justice also cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting.

Martin's and Brown's deaths, in addition to others including those of Sandra Bland, Walter Scott and Freddie Gray this year, have sparked protests nationwide for police reform and racial equality. The protests have predominantly been organized and led by the group #BlackLivesMatter, created by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tomet.

""Today, 60 years later we still have work to do,"" Till's other cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker, Jr. said in the news release. ""And our family still stands firmly behind the fight for justice.""

The commemoration for Till started this afternoon when a memorial motorcade was held in Chicago and when a wreath laying ceremony was held at Burr Oak Cemetery, where Till's body is buried.

A remembrance dinner will be held tonight in addition to a ""YOUth EmPOWERment Day"" on Satuday and a ""Gospel Regeneration"" day on Sunday for Till.",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/US/dylann-roof-hit-federal-hate-crime-charges-charleston/story?id=32620636,"The suspect in the Charleston church massacre that shook the nation planned to kill blacks with the goal of ""fanning racial flames"" around the country and as retribution for perceived slights against whites, according to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

Dylann Roof, 21, is accused of killing nine black worshipers at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. on June 17, allegedly armed to the hilt with a .45 caliber handgun and eight magazines loaded with hollow point bullets.

“To carry out these twin goals of fanning racial flames and exacting revenge, Roof further decided to seek out and murder African Americans because of their race,"" Lynch said. ""An essential element of his plan, however, was to find his victims inside of a church, specifically an African-American church, to ensure the greatest notoriety and attention to his actions.”

The 33-count indictment charges Roof with the nine murders and three attempted murders at the Charleston church under federal hate crime laws.

It also levels the identical charges against Roof under the civil rights provisions barring the obstruction of religious belief. In addition, Roof was charged with the illegal use of a firearm -– a Glock .45 caliber handgun -– in the commission of a crime.

The grand jury's action comes after an investigation by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

At a press conference today announcing the charges, Lynch said Roof planned to kill blacks in Church to spark racial animosity nationwide.

“As set forth in the indictment, several months prior to the tragic events of June 17, Roof conceived of his goal of increasing racial tensions throughout the nation and seeking retribution for perceived wrongs he believed African Americans had committed against white people,” Lynch said.

Roof went to the church on the night of June 17 during a bible study, Lynch said.

“Dylann Roof found his targets, African Americans engaged in worship.” Lynch said. “The parishioners had bibles. Dylann Roof had his .45 caliber Glock pistol and eight magazines loaded with hollow point bullets. And as set forth in the indictment, while the parishioners of Mother Emanuel were engaged in religious worship and bible study, Dylann Roof drew his pistol and opened fire on them, ultimately killing nine church members.”

Roof, who is white, also allegedly posted racist diatribes and pictures of himself holding a Confederate flag on an internet site.

The Charleston church murders sparked a national debate about the Confederate flag, and within a month of the shooting, the South Carolina legislature approved a measure to take down the Rebel flag that had flown on the state capitol grounds for more than 50 years. The controversy over the display of Confederate monuments, school names and symbols has continued in Congress, and around the country since the Church shooting.

Roof now faces up to life in prison or the death penalty as a result of the federal hate crime charges.

He was indicted earlier this month in Charleston on nine counts of murder, three counts of attempted murder, and a firearms charge in connection with the attack. Prosecutors have not said whether they will seek the death penalty in the case.",abcnews.com,True

Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church in Greeleyville, South Carolina has been classified as stemming from ""natural"" causes according to the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and the U.S. Department of Justice.

The finding comes amid a period of heightened alert about a series of recent church fires across the south and fears that they may be cases of arson. Two of those cases have been found to linked to natural causes and no links have yet been found between them.

It also comes in the wake of a racially motivated massacre in Charleston, SC that left 9 dead.

""Based upon the scene examination, the fire debris analysis, witness statements and a lightning strike report, the cause of the fire was best classified as natural,"" SLED told ABC News today in a statement. ""Investigators observed no indicator of criminal intent. The investigation is complete.""

Mt. Zion AME Church was totally destroyed after the fire gutted the house of worship Tuesday night, local officials said. Only the walls of the church were left standing, they added.

The predominantly black church in South Carolina has a history of being targeted and was burned to the ground by the KKK in 1995. President Clinton spoke at the dedication of the newly rebuilt church the next year.

Preliminary investigations into a series of five church fires in the south indicate that two of the fires were started by natural causes and one was the result of an electrical fire, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

""If in fact there is evidence to support hate crime charges in any one of these cases, the FBI, in coordination with the ATF and local authorities, will work closely with the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices to bring those forward,"" Justice Department spokesperson Melanie Newman told ABC News in a statement.",abcnews.com,True

According to the page, which was taken down this afternoon, the administrator said Amber Roof was supposed to marry fiance Michael Tyo June 24, but they canceled four days before the wedding after Dylann Roof allegedly shot the parishioners attending a Bible study at Emanuel AME Church.

Roof, 21, is being held without bail in the Charleston County jail and faces nine counts of murder.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/16-percent-american-church-fires-intentionally-set-stats/story?id=32163601,"Fires break out at churches and other ""religious and funeral properties"" in the US an average of 1,780 times in recent years -- about 34 a week -- and 16 percent of those were found to have been intentionally set, according to statistics from a non-profit fire protection group.

The scrutiny of church fires comes as federal investigators look into the cause of a fire at a historic black church in South Carolina that was previously burned down by a hate group.

Though the investigation into the fire that started at the Mt. Zion AME Church in Greeleyville on Tuesday night is only in its initial stages, sources close to the investigation have told ABC News that it does not appear to have been a criminal act. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that six other recent church fires across the south are racially motivated, a senior law enforcement source told ABC News.

According to statistics collected by the National Fire Protection Association, a non-profit ""devoted to eliminating death, injury, property and economic loss due to fire, electrical and related hazards,"" about 16 percent of fires at places of worship and funeral homes between 2007 and 2011 were intentionally set.

It was not clear what percentage of these fires, an average of 280 a year, were considered hate crimes.

By contrast, 30 percent were from cooking (most of which were ""minor""), the top cause and another 16 percent were electrical. Candles and smoking accounted for smaller percentages, the statistics from the report, date June 2013, say.

Arson accounted for 25 percent of the property damage from fires, compared to 4 percent from cooking. The study defines a structure fire as ""any fire that occurs in or on a structure...even if the fire was limited to contents and the building itself was not damaged.""

Overall fires at churches declined from 3,500 in 1980 to 1,660 in 2011, the latest year for which statistics were available, a drop of about 53 percent.

Initial witness reports from the Mt. Zion fire suggested that the blaze may have been started as a result of lightning hitting the roof, but local and federal authorities involved in the investigation were careful not to reveal any details at a press conference this morning.

""We haven't ruled anything in or anything out at this point,” Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms special agent in charge Craig Chillcott said. “We're going to let the case dictate.”

The ATF released a statement on Tuesday saying that they are investigating five fires that were reported in as many states in the past two weeks though they say they have no reason to believe the series of church fires were racially motivated or related.

The fires came amid heightened tensions caused by the racially charged massacre at a Charleston, South Carolina church that left nine people, including a pastor dead and an uproar over the Confederate flag flying at the South Carolina statehouse.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/string-fires-predominantly-black-churches-raises-suspicion/story?id=32102943,"A string of churches with predominantly black congregations – from Florida to Tennessee -- has reported fires in the past week, officials say.

The circumstances surrounding the six fires in five states differ in each case, but their occurring in the past eight days has prompted closer scrutiny.

So far only two of the six cases are being investigated as arson, and federal authorities have not launched any official hate crime investigations.

Arson was a notable problem for black churches in the mid-1990s and prompted then-President Bill Clinton to push for the creation of the Church Arson Prevention Act in 1996, though a related U.S. Department of Justice task force was suspended at the end of his second term.

This week's fires come amid a tense time in some Southern cities after a shooting by an alleged racist at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, left nine dead. The result has been a push for the removal of the Confederate flag from several state Capitols amid reignited debates over the region's racial history.

A senior official from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said they have special agents, certified fire investigators, looking into the different fires.

""At this time, ATF has not determined the fires are related. We are still determining origin and cause so we cannot say all are arson,"" the official told ABC News.

The ATF is also reportedly checking the fires against its Bomb Arson Tracking System to see whether there are any commonalities among the fires.

Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama, a hate group-monitoring organization, said only three of the six fires appear to be true cases of arson. And while those three -- in Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina -- may have been intentionally set, he said he believes it's unlikely they were done in an organized and unified fashion.

""I think it's very unlikely,in terms of a conspiracy,"" he told ABC News.

""It's entirely possible, perhaps even likely, that some of these churches were attacked because of all that's happened in the past three weeks,"" Potok said in reference to the debate over the continued use of the Confederate battle flag.

WSOC

The first fire was reported at the College Hill Seventh Day Adventist Church in Knoxville, Tennessee, on Sunday, June 21. Stacks of hay and soil were placed against the church's metal doors and set on fire, according to ABC affiliate WATE-TV.

""I see this and I think of an intention to try to destroy this entire church,"" Pastor Cleveland Hobdy III told WATE.

Knoxville Police Department spokesman Darrell DeBusk told WATE that it has been deemed an incident of vandalism and not a hate crime because, in most hate crime cases, the suspect leaves a message or indication of the reason behind the attack and no such mention was found in this case.

The second church was in Georgia two days later, and Macon Bibb County Fire Chief Marvin Riggins told station WMAZ that it was suspicious and is being investigated as an arson.

Fruitland Presbyterian Church in Gibson County, Tennessee, was also set on fire that same day and officials have not released any updates about the investigation, nor did they immediately return ABC News' calls. Fire Chief Bryan Cathey told ABC affiliate WBBJ-TV that there were some questions about whether it was an accidental fire because residents recalled there being several lightning strikes in the area around the time of the fire.

The fourth fire burned down a portion of the Briar Creek Road Baptist Church in east Charlotte, North Carolina, in the early morning hours of June 24, and investigators immediately classified it as arson.

""We completed our work on the scene and determined this was intentionally set,"" Charlotte Fire Department senior investigator David Williams told The Associated Press of the $250,000 worth of damage.

The GOP's 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, urged the state to remove the flag, calling it a ""symbol of racial hatred.""

President Obama agreed:

Take down the #ConfederateFlag at the SC Capitol. To many, it is a symbol of racial hatred. Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) June 20, 2015

The 2016 presidential candidates have been asked to weigh in on whether the flag should be removed from the grounds, prompting some to call for its immediate removal while others have said it’s a decision left to the people of South Carolina.

ABC News reached out to all of the declared and potential 2016 candidates for their positions on the Confederate flag in South Carolina. Here’s a look at where the candidates stand on the issue.

TAKE THE FLAG DOWN

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie voiced his stance on removing the flag for the first time Tuesday afternoon, nearly a full day after South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley announced her support for its removal.

""I commend Governor Haley for her decision to remove the flag from the grounds of the state capitol. While this is a necessary step towards addressing a divisive symbol of racism in our country, this step will mean little if we do not also honestly confront and discuss the fact that these murders were born out of ugly hate and racism,"" Christie said. ""That is what we must stand up against and fight even more than any symbol; it is long overdue that we not only shine a light on and condemn the symbols of hate, but on the haters themselves as well.""

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, weighed in on the issue for the first time Tuesday morning, announcing his support for removing the flag in an interview with ABC radio affiliate WRKO.

“For every African American in the country it’s a symbol of slavery for them and now it’s a symbol of murder -- it’s time to put it in a museum,"" Paul said.

Former New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, was one of the first 2016 contenders to call for the flag’s removal.

""In the 21st century, that flag shouldn't be on the Capitol ground in the state of South Carolina,"" Pataki said on Fox News. ""I think they'll do the right thing. They'll remove the flag.”

Jeb Bush, also a Republican, believes the Confederate flag should be taken down from the South Carolina State Capitol, as was done in Florida during his tenure as governor, a Bush spokesperson told ABC News.

Lindsey Graham, one of South Carolina’s Republican senators, called for the removal of the flag, saying it would be ""another step towards healing and recognition"" as the state mourns the murder of nine African Americans at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston last week.

“In the worst of tragedies, we have seen the best of South Carolina. Today, I am urging that the Confederate Battle Flag be removed from statehouse grounds to an appropriate location. After the tragic, hate-filled shooting in Charleston, it is only appropriate that we deal once and for all with the issue of the flag,"" Graham said.

Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, weighed in on the South Carolina confederate flag debate back in 2007 and still holds the view that it should be removed.

.@nikkihaley is right 2 call for removal of a symbol of hate in SC. As I’ve said for years, taking down Confederate flag is long overdue. –H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 22, 2015

Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, a Democrat, called for the flag to be removed in a speech at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in San Francisco on Sunday.

""What a terribly jarring and callous sight then -- in the wake of this racist massacre -- to see the American flag at half-staff, while above it at full-staff over the state capitol of South Carolina flew a Confederate flag,” O’Malley said. “If the families of Charleston can forgive ... can let go of their anger ... is it really too much to ask the state government officials of South Carolina to retire the Confederate flag to a museum?”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, described the flag as a ""relic of our nation's stained racial history"" when calling for its removal.

The confederate flag is a relic of our nation’s stained racial history. It should come down. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) June 22, 2015

Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who has yet to announce whether he will run for president, initially said the people of South Carolina should decide whether the flag is removed, but later announced his support for taking down the flag after Haley called for its removal.

I am glad @nikkihaley is calling for the Confederate flag to come down. I support her decision - SKW — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) June 22, 2015

After Haley announced her decision, Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich said he supported removing the Confederate flag from the state house grounds.

""I fully support Governor Haley’s leadership today in calling for the flag to come down. This is a decision for South Carolina to make and they are now starting that process,"" Kasich said. ""Like Governor Haley, I believe the flag should come down.""

Former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee ""believes the Confederate flag should not be flown on state property,"" an aide to Chafee told ABC News.

NO FIRM POSITION ON THE FLAG

Many declared and potential 2016 candidates wouldn’t give a clear answer on whether the flag should be removed. Republican candidates including Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Bobby Jindal, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, and Rick Santorum have argued the decision should be made by the people of South Carolina.

“This is a decision that needs to be made here in South Carolina,” Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, told ABC News’ Martha Raddatz on ""This Week"" Sunday.

“We'll let the states decide that, but again, just like the gun issue, let's have that debate at the right time. And right now we should all be in mourning,” Louisiana Gov. Jindal told ABC News’ Rick Klein in an interview Friday.

“I don't personally display it anywhere. So it's not an issue for me,"" Former Arkansas Gov. Huckabee said on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" Sunday. ""That's an issue for the people of South Carolina.""

“I think that’s a question for South Carolina. And the last thing they need is people from outside of the state coming in and dictating how they should resolve it,” Cruz said this weekend.

""I understand the passions that this debate evokes on both sides,"" the senator from Texas told the Washington Post, ""both those who see a history of racial oppression and a history of slavery, which is the original sin of our nation ... [and] those who want to remember the sacrifices of their ancestors and the traditions of their states, not the racial oppression, but the historical traditions.”

""I applaud Governor Haley for her leadership at this difficult time. I appreciate and respect her statement that 'This is South Carolina's statehouse, it is South Carolina's historic moment, and this will be South Carolina's decision,'"" said Rubio, of Florida. ""I have no doubt that given how the people of South Carolina have dealt with this tragedy so far, they will continue to inspire the nation with their courage, compassion and unity.""

“Well, I can tell you, you can put up Confederate flags everywhere or you could get rid of them,” Carson said on Fox News Sunday. ""It’s not going to make any difference. What’s going to make a difference is do we change people’s hearts and minds. Now, I do recognize that some things are inflammatory. ... The Confederate flag causes a lot of people angst and they’re not able to see beyond that. And I think the people of South Carolina should really sit down and have an intelligent discussion about what can they use that captures their heritage, captures the heritage of America and allows them to coexist in peace.”

“I don’t think it’s my decision. I think it’s the people of South Carolina’s decision,” Fiorina told reporters Friday. “I think it’s clearly a symbol that is very offensive to many, but my personal opinion is not what’s relevant here.”

""The decision to remove the Confederate flag needs to be made by the people of South Carolina, and Gov. Haley's leadership today honors the people of Charleston, and the families of the victims of last week's horrific hate crime. Removing the flag is an act of healing and unity, that allows us to find a shared purpose based on the values that unify us,"" Perry said. ""May God continue to be with the families of the victims in Charleston, and the great people of South Carolina.""

But Roof purportedly found the CofCC online and, according to a manifesto law enforcement sources say was likely written by Roof, it played a key role in sending him down a path that would eventually lead to a massacre in a South Carolina church.

""But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words 'black on White crime' into Google, and I have never been the same since that day. The first website I came to was the Council of Conservative Citizens. There were pages upon pages of these brutal black on White murders,"" Roof purportedly wrote. ""I was in disbelief. At this moment I realized that something was very wrong.""

Witnesses said that during the shooting, Roof told his victims that he had to act because ""you're raping our women"" and ""taking over our country.""

Taylor said the CofCC can understand where Roof is coming from. In speaking with ABC News, Taylor repeated a dubious statistic circulated by the CofCC, claiming that every year 20,000 white women are raped by black men.

In claiming that black men rape 20,000 white women a year, based on a 2008 Department of Justice report, the group has clearly exaggerated and misused the statistics. The 20,000 figure refers to white victims of a wide range of alleged sexual crimes including rape, sexual assault or “verbal threats.” Nor does the group acknowledge that in that same year, the vast majority of those accused of the same crimes were white, nearly 90,000 out of the 118,000 incidents involving white victims.

A tool on the BJS website that does not take into account the victim's race says that nearly 4,000 black individuals were arrested for rape in 2008. The same year, nearly 10,000 whites were.

Heidi Beirich, who studies hate groups as the Intelligence Project Director at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told ABC News last week that the line about black men raping white women is ""probably the most common racist statement ever said against black men in the United States.""

""This idea that black men are raping white women, it goes to the heart of the white supremacist thing,"" she said. ""I mean basically the propaganda that they believe are that black people are violent, sexual deviants, everything bad that you can say about a population. And what they do is they cite every single crime involving some kind of African-American attack on a white person and claim these are hate crimes against whites. Of course, it's a terrible mixing of what's a hate crime and what is just common street crime that people suffer all the time. But the way they've come to see it, is that white genocide is happening and it's being perpetrated by black people.""

The Southern Poverty Law Center lists the CofCC as a hate group -- a designation Taylor denies.

Taylor told ABC News that although the media covers up or brushes aside the ""horribly lopsided plague of black-on-white violence,"" there are others like Roof who see it, and Taylor said that the ""denunciation of whites"" in the wake of the shooting will only make things worse.

""This is dangerous,"" said the statement released by the CofCC today. ""Our society's silence about these crimes -- despite enormous amounts of attention to 'racially tinged' acts by whites -- only increases the anger of people like Dylann Roof. This double standard only makes acts of murderous frustration more likely.""

Before it was alleged that Roof found the CofCC online, Beirich told ABC News that the internet was a ""gold mine for white supremacists in terms of messaging, just like it is for everybody else.""

""Unfortuately, there are fragile-minded folks who get exposed to this stuff and sometimes commit acts of violence,"" she said.

When asked if there were more Dylann Roofs out there, Taylor said, ""that's a terrifying possibility.""

Roof was arrested last week in North Carolina after a frantic manhunt. He has not entered a plea in the case.",abcnews.com,True

Reporter: Just days after nine people were murdered at this historic black church, the doors opened if Sunday service and pews filled. White and black families together.

Now to dylann roof, that manifesto, those hateful words police are investigating -- ABC's legal analyst Dan Abrams and Michael German, a former FBI agent who infiltrated white supremacist groups join us now. Michael, you have seen reports of that manifesto that they're looking into, as dylann roof may have written it, what does that tell you about him? Where does that kind of hate come from? I think it fits a pattern where, individuals have some deep-seeded hatred or fear or frustration, and they're looking for some justification for it. So, they go to the internet, they go to different groups or organizations, trying to find some justification, where their anger and frustration can fit in. You once infiltrated a white supremacist group, but it doesn't appear he was affiliated with any group, is this something new, lone wolf? No, it's not new. The above-ground groups, the groups you hear about, the so-called hate groups, tend not to be involved in criminal activity. Because they're identifiable. It's not usual. They're actually instructed to go out and do something on their own or with a small cell of like-minded people. And Dan Abrams, that brings to mind, they're charging him or looking into it as a hate crime, but there seems to be so many similarities to terrorism, does it matter what they charge him with? Does it matter if it's hate crime, terrorism? We need to separate it out into the federal and state possible charges. Under South Carolina law, there actually isn't a hate crime law, so, if they were going to pursue this as a hate crime, they would have to do it federally. The more likely scenario, though, is that he gets charged in South Carolina, under their state law, and faces the possibility of the death penalty, the death penalty would be much harder, there would be more convolated way to get there. Garden variety murder case, where the death penalty is on the table in the killing of these nine people. And do you see any defense here for dylann roof, if you were dylann roof's lawyer? Not as of right now, I mean, it seems he's cooperating with the authorities. Look, in occasional cases you see someone who comes forward, who cooperates with the authorities, sometimes you'll see someone plead guilty in a case like this, you know people talk about immediately about the insanity defense. The insanity defense is so hard to win, particularly in a case like this, where seems to have been so much sort of premeditation and thought. What he was going to do and why he was going to do it. When you think of his defense, I think his lawyers right now are trying to sort out exactly what happened here and trying to just get through these initial proceedings, figure out, is this going to be tried in state or federal court? And make the ultimate determine -- ultimate determination which is, is my client going to plead guilty? Thank you very much, Dan. And Michael.

Today we heard from the family of accused mass murderer dylann roof. In a written statement offering their condolences to those who lost loved ones in Wednesday's massacre. We're also hearing from those families, still reeling of course, and yet proving they're not just relatives of victims, they're people of deep and abiding faith. In the aftermath of the tragedy in Charleston. This is the case of state versus dylann roof -- Reporter: The irony was palpable. This baby-faced, polite southern man -- You're unemployed at this time? Yes, sir. Reporter: Accused of the most heinous of crimes. Mr. Roof, you're charged with nine counts of murder, one count of possession of a weapon during commission of a violent crime -- Reporter: Facing on a video link the people whose loved ones he allegedly stole. You took something very precious away from me. For me, I'm a work in progress and I acknowledge that I am very angry. Every fiber in my body hurts. And I'll never be the same. Reporter: The relatives all off-camera, all on point. Faith, love, forgiveness. You hurt a lot of people. But god forgives you and I forgive you. I forgive you, my family forgive you. We are the family that love built. We have no room for hate. So we have to forgive. Reporter: It was what none of us expected. But what all of us hope we're capable of. Even Felicia sanders, mother to one of the victims who survived the shooting herself by playing dead. We welcomed you Wednesday night in our bible study with open arms. You have killed some of the most beautifulest people that I know. That juw that Juan intra reserve tywanza sanders is my son. Tywanza was my hero. But as we said in bible study, we enjoyed you. But may god have mercy on you. Reporter: Outside the court the daughter of Ethel lance addressing the question so many of us were wondering. The last family that's going to be okay. And that's all I have to say. How do you express forgiveness in there? I'm a Christian woman. I believe in god. Reporter: This opportunity to forgive in court made possible by the most unlikely of detectives. A florist in North Carolina. Something just kept telling me, you need -- there's something about that car. Reporter: Debbie Dills says she spotted a car she recognized from the news coverage of Wednesday night's massacre. She ended up following him for 30 miles, relaying his license plate and location to police. Just something about it. It had to be the lord. I was afraid, I was scared, I'm not trying to be heroic here or anything. I was afraid. Because I didn't know what he might do, because look what he'd already done. Reporter: Roof had been on the run for more than 12 hours, driving 250 miles from Charleston to Shelby after police say he gunned down nine people at historic mother Emanuel ame church late Wednesday. In the warrant released by authorities, new details about the shooting. All victims were hit multiple times. Roof is described as acting with malice and aforethought. Standing over a witness, one of the survivors, and uttering a racially inflammatory statement. It seems the defense is in a really tough position. Sure looks like there's a lot of evidence against him. The interesting question is going to be what if he said, I'll plead guilty but you've got to take the death penalty off the table. In many, many cases, prosecutors would accept that. In this case? I think they probably won't. Reporter: With him now in custody, much of the conversation today turning to a search for an explanation, meaning. What triggered roof? Was it hate, terror, mental illness? It sure seems like he knew exactly what he was doing. And he was doing it because he wanted to kill people. Because he hated them. Reporter: One clue, this photo. Flag patches from roof's jacket. One from apartheid-era south Africa, the other from the former rhodesia when it was ruled by a white minority, now called Zimbabwe. This was not merely a mass shooting, not merely a matter of gun violence. This was a racial hate crime and must be confronted as such. Reporter: But another flag front and center today -- Certainly symbolically we cannot have the confederate flag waving in the state capitol. Reporter: It is an old and bitter debate in South Carolina. And as we were reminded today, passion on both sides. Being a relative of Robert E. Lee, I think it's part of our history. Maybe it shouldn't be forefront and center in front of the statehouse. But I think that it's still something that people need to see and remember that happened. I see a sign of hate to really tell you the truth. Hate and prejudice. I actually think they should take it down. It's just a flag. I understand some people have symbolism behind it. But there's symbolism behind lots of things. Honestly it doesn't bother me. Reporter: Those who know him say roof's alleged plan was six months in the making. This friend telling me colleague roof had a deep hatred for african-americans. What did he want to see happen? He wanted something big like trayvon martin. He wanted to make something spark up the race war again. Reporter: Meek and his mother Kim saw roof Tuesday. They say he always had a gun with him. What kind of guns did he have? .45 Glock. Did he carry it around? In his car. Reporter: On this day of pain and irony, an unexpected word from the unlikeliest friend of an accused mass murderer with a reported hatred of black people. He had a small group of select friends. I was one of them. I'm obviously of color. Reporter: Caleb brown says he and roof were childhood friends. Whatever road led roof to a black church with a loaded gun, brown says his life didn't start that way. It makes absolutely no sense at all. And that's why I'd say I still can't even really fathom that it was him that committed all of those heinous crimes. ? Oh the saints of god ? Reporter: No matter who or what dylann roof was or is, he was not the focus of those who prayed and cried in Charleston this evening. Tonight the largest visible Jill so far for the nine who died. A hateful, deranged young man took their lives. Reporter: Roof allegedly wanted to start a race war. It wa appear what he sparked was a revival. A reaffirmation of a nation's promise, not its problems.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/hate-groups-continue-spread-warnings-blacks-taking-country/story?id=31899443,"The racist statements attributed to accused murderer Dylann Roof in South Carolina are echoes of widely-spread and repeated messages “out of white supremacist central,” an expert on hate groups told ABC News.

Roof told his victims, “You all rape women and you’re taking over the country,” according to Sylvia Johnson, who spoke to a survivor after the shooting. Johnson, whose cousin was the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the pastor killed in the attack, told ABC News’ David Muir that Roof then added, “I have to do what I have to do.”

Roof has not been tied to any organized hate group, but his alleged statements track almost word-for-word with hate messages posted on line by white supremacist groups, according to Heidi Beirich, Intelligence Project Director at the Southern Poverty Law Center, who studies such groups.

“We don't know what the connections are between the shooter and these groups, but the fact of the matter is the words that he spoke in that church, if they're accurate, the way they've been reported, sound like they come right out of white supremacist central,” Beirich said. “In fact, the shooter's comments about you're raping people is probably the most common racist statement ever said against black men in the United States. This idea that black men are raping white women. It goes to the heart of white supremacist thinking.”

In a photo posted on Facebook, Roof is seen wearing a jacket with the flags of Apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia – eras when those respective African nations were ruled by a white minority and accused of brutal oppression of the black majority. Such outdated flags are commonly seen in online propaganda postings by extremist groups.

Thursday law enforcement officers were seen removing computers and boxes of evidences from residences where Roof had recently stayed. And while so far there is no indication that Roof “was anything but a lone actor,” law enforcement sources told ABC News that Roof’s computers and cellphones will be studied for possible connections to hate groups or other individuals.

The Southern Poverty Law Center lists 19 “hate groups” in South Carolina -- all but two, it says, are related to the white supremacist movement.

Beirich noted that one group, the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC), which bills itself as a “conservative activist group,” has a section on its website dedicated to the victims of “white violence in America” –- white people allegedly killed by black people.

“There is no white supremacist [web]site that you go on today that is not going to have as it’s number one topic of discussion this issue,” Beirich said.

After the shooting, the CofCC posted a message saying the organization was “deeply saddened” by the massacre.

“The loss of nine lives is devastating. It cost [sic] also have severe consequences in terms of race relations in the U.S. in general, South Carolina in particular,” the group said. “We pray, for the sake of all Americans, that there will not be an escalation of racial tension.”

On the more general white nationalist internet message boards, a similar sentiment of sympathy was common, but it could not drown out allegations that the killing was a “false flag” operation somehow orchestrated by gun-control supporters, or the feeling by others that while the killing was bad, black crime was worse.

Others went further, simply cheering on the carnage.

“I hereby nominate this man [Roof] for the 2015 Nobel peace prize,” one poster said. “More power to the guy. Just imagine the situation if all white men were like this. We would have eternal peace.”

President Obama today addressed what he called ""lingering"" racism that is ""poisoning the minds of young people.""

“The apparent motivations of the shooter remind us that racism remains a blight that we have to combat together,"" the president said. ""We have made great progress but we have to be vigilant because it’s still lingering and when it's poisoning the minds of young people it betrays our ideals and it tears our democracy apart.”

Beirich said the internet has become a breeding ground for such beliefs.

“The internet is a gold mine for white supremacists in terms of messaging, just like it is for everybody else,” she said. “Unfortunately, there are fragile-minded folks who get exposed to this stuff and sometimes commit acts of violence. Maybe that happened here. We’ll have to wait and see what more comes out.”

Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a firearm during a violent crime. He has not pleaded, but a law enforcement source told ABC News today that he confessed to the crime.",abcnews.com,True

His father also told investigators Roof, 21, owned a .45-caliber handgun, the warrants say.

Roof, who’s now in police custody, allegedly confessed to killing nine people at Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church Wednesday night, according to a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation.

Roof allegedly stood over a survivor and ""uttered a racially inflammatory statement"" before leaving the Bible study room where the victims were shot, according to warrants.

Roof, who appeared at a bond hearing this afternoon, has been charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, according to the Charleston Police Department.

""We are getting cooperation at this point,"" the law enforcement official told ABC News today.

Interviews with Roof are ongoing, the official said.

Roof spent Thursday night in protective custody and on suicide watch at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston, according to the Charleston County Sheriff's Office. Roof is permitted to have visitors, but no one has come to see him, the Sheriff's Office said today.

He has been assigned public defender Ashley Pennington, according to court personnel. Pennington has not responded to ABC News' request for comment.

“I forgive you,” the daughter of victim Ethel Lance, 70, said through tears to Roof, who appeared at the bond hearing via video-conferencing from jail. ""You took something very precious from me and I will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again. But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.""

ABC News

Felicia Sanders, the mother of the slain Tywanza Sanders, 26, said, ""We welcomed you Wednesday night in our Bible study with open arms.""

""Every fiber in my body hurts,"" Sanders said. ""And I'll never be the same.""

Alana Simmons, granddaughter of victim Daniel Simmons Sr., 74, said, ""Although my grandfather and the other victims died at the hands of hate, this is proof everyone's plea for your soul is proof that they lived and loved and their legacies will live and love. So hate won't win and I just want to thank the court for making sure that hate doesn't win.""

Bethane Middleton Brown, the sister of Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor said, “For me, I am a work in progress. And I acknowledge I am very angry. But one thing that she's always joined in our family with is that she taught me that we are the families that love built. We have no room for hate so we have to forgive. I pray God on your soul and I also thank god that I will be around when your judgment day comes with him. May God bless you.""

""I forgive you,"" said Anthony Thompson, the husband of slain Myra Thompson, 59. ""But we would like you to take this opportunity to repent. Repent, confess, give your life to the one who matters most: Christ. So that he can change it, can change your ways no matter what happened to you and you'll be OK. Do that and you'll be better off than what you are right now.""

The Justice Department said today it is expediting a $29 million grant to go toward victim assistance in Charleston.

Judge James Gosnell, before asking relatives whether they wanted to comment, opened Roof's hearing with a lengthy statement, calling for strength for the victims' families and the family of the alleged shooter.

“There are victims on this young man’s side of the family,"" Gosnell said. “We must find it in our heart…to help his family as well.”

Roof stood expressionless. He was cuffed with two heavily armed guards behind him.

Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, according to the Charleston Police Department. Roof was ineligible for bond on the murder charges in Gosnell’s court, by state law. But the judge set $1 million bond on the single weapons charge.

Friday evening, Roof's family released a statement expressing their ""deepest sympathies and condolences to families of the victims.""

""Words cannot express our shock, grief, and disbelief as to what happened that night. We are devastated and saddened by what occurred,"" the statement said.

""We have all been touched by the moving words from the victims’ families offering God’s forgiveness and love in the face of such horrible suffering.""

http://abcnews.go.com/US/confederate-flags-flies-south-carolina-debate-continues-symbol/story?id=31892710,"The shooting of nine black parishioners at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday night has reopened the controversy surrounding the state’s continued display of the Confederate flag on capitol grounds.

The Battle Flag of the Northern Virginia Army, made famous by Robert Lee but never formerly adopted as the national flag of the confederacy, was first placed above South Carolina’s State Capitol’s Dome in 1961. It arrived, like many other appropriations of the controversial symbol, in response to the civil rights and desegregation movements.

""This was a symbol of pushback on the part of white South Carolina leaders,” David Goldfield, Professor of history at the University of North Carolina and author of Still Fighting the Civil War, told ABC News.

Goldfield said the thinking behind the decision to fly the flag was “we’re going to put this flag in your face because we’re against race-mixing.”

Here is an explainer on the ongoing debate:

What is the history?

In 2000, legislators voted to move the flag from the top of the dome to the front lawn. It is currently illegal to remove the flag without additional legislation.

“What they did was take the flag down and put it right smack in the middle of state house grounds,"" Goldfield said, adding that it was “definitely more visible today than it was back then.""

“We're trying to sow unity, a unity of purpose, a unity of commitment, a unity of resolve, so that we can confront racism in our midst. And that means certainly, symbolically, we can't have the Confederate flag waving in the state capital,” NAACP President Cornell Brooks said at a press conference in South Carolina today.

Proponents of the continued usage of the Confederate flag, such as the Virginia Flaggers and the Sons of Confederate Veterans, often argue that the flag is a symbol of heritage and not hate.

""The Virginia Flaggers call on all those of Southern ancestry to resist any and all endeavors to use this tragedy as a platform to erase our history and attack the honor of our Confederate veterans,"" the group wrote to ABC News in a statement.

Proponents of the continued usage of the flag argue that most Confederate soldiers did not own slaves and that their use of the flag is not rooted in animosity toward African-Americans, but rather a celebration of their ancestors who fought and died under the flag’s colors. But opponents of its usage argue that interpretation ignores history.

“The bottom line is that from historian’s point of view, the connection between the Confederate battle flag and white supremacy is unmistakable,” said David Goldfield.

“When in 1863 the Confederate congress was debating the issue of a flag, they made it clear that this was representing white supremacy,” he added.

South Carolina, which is one of five states that still doesn't have a state hate crime law, celebrated ""Confederate Memorial Day"" this past May, during which a large Confederate flag was displayed on the steps of the South Carolina State Capitol.

Why is the flag still flying?

Goldfield argues that the flag should continue to be displayed in a historical setting such as museums, but that its display above the state capitol and elsewhere throughout the country is an affront to the African American population.

“You share the state with 30 to 40 percent of the population are African Americans, for them this flag is the symbol of the confederacy which was formed to preserve and protect the institution of slavery and therefore this banner is not only obnoxious but extremely hurtful and a serves as a reminder of human bondage,” he said.

What happens after Wednesday's shooting?

Following this week's shooting, the flag issue seeped into the debate on the presidential campaign trail, with candidate Lindsey Graham, South Carolina's own senior Senator, suggesting that perhaps it’s time to “revisit that decision.""

Gov. Nikki Haley, who was in tears during a news conference Thursday morning, had previously rejected the notion of removing the flag at a debate last year, saying it was a ""sensitive issue.""

Haley's press secretary told ABC News: ""In South Carolina, the governor does not have legal authority to alter the flag. Only the General Assembly can do that.""

According to a 2011 Pew Research poll, just 9 percent of Americans have a positive reaction to the confederate flag -- and just under a third have a negative reaction.

Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters today that President Obama “believes the Confederate flag belongs in museums.”

http://abcnews.go.com/US/dylann-roof-naacp-leader-condemns-shooting-act-racial/story?id=31886619,"NAACP President Cornell William Brooks today condemned the South Carolina church shooting as ""an act of racial terrorism,” adding that it ""must be treated as such.""

""People of all faiths, of all traditions, every hue, every heritage, are quite simply shocked by this crime,"" Brooks said at a passionate news conference in downtown Charleston.

He said the NAACP, which he runs from the organization’s Baltimore headquarters, is 106 years old and still committed to fighting injustice, including racial profiling.

“We will not give in ... to the forces of hate,” Brooks said.

The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the incident to determine whether federal charges, including a possible hate crime, are warranted. ”We are not saying it is a domestic terror investigation,"" a senior Justice Department official told ABC News today. ""We are saying we aren’t ruling out any investigative avenue.""

Investigators plan to be meticulous, confiscating computers and phones to make sure Roof was not directed by any domestic terror group or anyone associated with the Ku Klux Klan or others. There's no evidence of that so far, two federal officials say. But “we will go wherever the evidence takes us,” they say.

As for potential outcomes, Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley said in an earlier news conference today he has ""no doubt"" the death penalty will be sought in Dylann Roof's case, though he is personally ""not a proponent of the death penalty.""

ABC News

""If you're going to have a death penalty, then certainly this case would merit it,"" Riley told reporters today, though expressing his preference for prison time.

""No doubt it will be sought, and I have no control over that,"" he said of state law that makes the death penalty an option.

Riley, who has been widely admired during his 40 years as mayor, said he believes capital punishment ""collectively, over time, adds to violence.""

""I think people who commit serious crimes should lose their freedom forever,"" Riley, 72, said at a news conference in Charleston.

The mayor, a Democrat, also today touched on Charleston's inclusive community.

""Our citizens are all races and backgrounds and all neighborhoods work very closely together,"" Riley said.

""Mr. Roof did not live in Charleston. He didn't grow up here. He lived in a 100 mile away town and came here,"" Riley added. ""So his actions are not in any way representative of this city or this community. They're representative of somebody who lived away and mind and heart was twisted that caused him to exact this horrible deed.""

Roof, 21, has been charged with nine counts of murder in the shooting deaths Wednesday at the predominantly black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/charleston-shooting-florist-reveals-helped-catch-dylann-roof/story?id=31885061,"A North Carolina woman's attention to detail helped bring Thursday's manhunt for alleged gunman Dylann Roof to a quick resolution.

Early Thursday morning, police released pictures from surveillance footage showing Roof, 21, outside the Charleston, South Carolina, church where he allegedly killed nine people Wednesday night. Police also released a photo and description of Roof's car.

Later in the morning, Debbie Dills was on her way to work at a florist shop in Kings Mountain, North Carolina – about 250 miles north of Charleston -- when a car caught her eye.

""I’d been watching a lot of the news coverage starting the night before and I’d been really thinking and praying about the people there and how horrific what happened to them was,"" she told ABC News.

""I'd seen pictures of the car and pictures of the young man, and I looked over and noticed the car,"" Dills said. ""And I just couldn't figure out why I was looking at it.

""And then I realized, I had seen the car. I'd seen the South Carolina state license plate on the car. And then I'd seen the haircut,"" she said. ""The things the news was telling us to look for or to look at.""

Dills called her boss, who contacted police.

Dills then decided ""to follow him to see if I could get the tag number,"" she said.

""Once the call came in and she told us where she was in the city, then we were able to get our cars over to her,"" Shelby Police Chief Jeffrey Ledford told ABC News. ""Of course at that point [the police are] following behind him to identify the car to make sure they got the right one.""

Around 10:45 a.m., police pulled Roof over in Shelby, a town about 20 minutes down the road from Kings Mountain.

""I didn't want to believe it was him, but turns out it was him,"" Dills said.

Roof was cooperative when police pulled him over, according to Ledford. ""No issues,"" he added. ""He went peacefully.""

Roof was taken into custody in North Carolina where he waived extradition.

Roof returned to South Carolina Thursday night where he was placed in protective custody and on suicide watch at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston, according to the Charleston County Sheriff's Office.

Roof has been charged with one count of murder to start the legal process, Solicitor Scarlett Wilson said. More charges are expected to be added.

Reporter: Childhood friend joey Meeks and his mom Kim saw roof on Tuesday, the day before the shooting. They say the FBI showed up at their house after they called police when they recognized roof's face on TV. They say roof advocated for segregation and always carried a gun in his car.

Just two months later roof arrested again at that same mall for trespassing. And this morning, new questions -- What do you have to say. Reporter: Get so few answers.

But during this vigil to pray for those who lost their lives, through the tears, a moment of relief. The suspect in Wednesday night's deadly church massacre now in custody. That awful person, that terrible human being who would go into a place of worship where people were praying and kill them, is now in custody. Where he will always remain. Reporter: 21-year-old dylann roof finally captured during a traffic stop across state lines in Shelby, North Carolina. More than 200 miles from Charleston. And late tonight, roof transported back to south Carolina. Police saying a citizen alerted this emto his car. He was transported here to the Shelby police department. We currently have representatives from all the agencies that are involved in this investigation. Here on-site to work through the process of getting Mr. Roof back to South Carolina. Reporter: Roof accused of committing one of the deadliest attacks on a place of worship in United States history. At 8:00 P.M. Wednesday night, he enters the historic mother Emanuel ame church. Witnesses say he joined the prayer group, sitting with church members for nearly an hour before opening fire. 9:05 P.M., police responded, arriving to a gruesome scene. Advising of an active shooter, multiple people down. Reporter: Eight dying inside that church, one on the way to the hospital, in all six women and three men. Roof fleeing the scene, putting the community on alert. It is not completely secure, we have someone running around downtown, there's a possibility there's an active shooter in the area.

The grand motor, when it was done, telling her story to the pastor's cousin Sylvia who spoke to ABC's David Muir. The gunman came in and asked, where's the minister? He asked that? He asked, where's the minister? And they showed him where he was. And clementa being the kind, spirited person that he is, he -- he had him to sit next to him when they were getting ready to dismiss. That he -- he started shooting. He loaded up about five times. You spoke with one of three survivors. There were three total? Yes. What did she tell you? She said it was just horrible. It was just blood all over the place. She played dead in order to survive, in order to get him not to shoot her. She told her granddaughter to play dead too? Play dead, yes. When he got up, that's when the gunman questioned him and started, you know, saying, y'all rape our women and y'all have taken over the country. And I have to do what I have to do. Reporter: After it was over -- We got two people coming out, adult female and a child, they were found in the room. They need to get checked out.

Reporter: Tonight many wondering if roof targeted the church for its role in the fight for black equality. In this video from 2013, reverend pinckney lays out the church's place throughout American history. Freedom to worship and freedom from sin, freedom to be full what god intends us to be, and have equality in the sight of god. Reporter: In the decades leading to emancipation, black churches were outlawed in Charleston. Mother Emanuel became a bedrook of the civil rights movement. The reverend martin Luther king Jr. Visited. In those years black churches were on the front lines, targeted with arson and bombs. The fact that this took place in a black church obviously also raises questions about a dark part of our history. This is not the first time that black churches have been attacked. Reporter: The federal government opening a hate crime investigation. Acts like this one have no place in our country and no place in a civilized society. Reporter: Investigators now hoping to find out exactly who dylann roof is. You're talking about a 21-year-old who typically 21-year-olds communicate via social media. It's extremely important to seize their computers, laptops, cell phones. Because most of their communication may well be in those devices. Reporter: Those who know him say roof's alleged plan was six months in the making. He was emotionless to me. Reporter: Today this friend since childhood telling me roof had a deep hatred of black people. He wanted segregation. What did he want to see happen? How was he going to do this? I think he wanted something big like trayvon martin, wanted to spark a race war. Reporter: In this photo nag patches on roof's jacket, one from apartheid-era South Africa, the other from the former rhodesia when it was ruled by a white minority, now called Zimbabwe. Joey meek and his mom saw roof just Tuesday. They say he always had a gun with him. What kind of guns? .45 Glock. Did he carry it around? In his car. Reporter: They called police when they saw him on TV this morning. FBI showing up at their home today. This is a small town. A close-knit community. Neighbors saw roof coming in and out of the country store all the time but he never raised any suspicion. But earlier this year, his bizarre behavior leading to run-ins with police. In February, roof wearing all-black, arrested at a mall after asking employees out of the ordinary questions.

Graham, who knew the pastor who was killed in the tragedy, said his niece went to 8th grade and high school with suspect Dylann Roof.

According to the senator, his sister Darline told him about his niece Emily going to school with roof.

""Emily said that in school he was just a quiet, strange kid,"" Graham said on ABC's ""The View"" Wednesday morning. ""Seems like one of these Newtown type guys,"" referring to the Connecticut massacre.

After news broke overnight of the deadly church shooting that took nine lives, Graham joined ABC's ""The View,"" which he was previously scheduled appear on before the tragic events in his home-state unfolded.

""I can’t explain this,"" he said. ""I don’t know what would make a young man at 21 get so sick and twisted to kill 9 people in a church – this is beyond my understanding.""

Graham said he thinks it was probably a number of factors that led to the young man to open fire during the Bible Study class.

""There are real people out there who are organized to kill people in religion and based on race,"" Graham said. ""But it’s 2015 there are people out there looking for Christians to kill them. So this is a mean time we live in.""

Pinckney, 41, was among the nine shot to death at Wednesday night Bible study.

The woman who survived, whose name has not been publicly released, had blood on her dress when she was speaking to Johnson on Wednesday night. Both the survivor and her granddaughter reportedly evaded the gunman by pretending they were dead.

“She said it was just like...it was just blood all over the place,” Johnson told ABC News.

The survivor's son, who was in his 20s, was also at the Bible study but he was fatally shot after he tried to check on Pinckney and directly engaged the shooter.

Johnson said the survivor told her the gunman, addressing her son, said, ""You all rape women and you're taking over our country.""

The gunman added, “I have to do what I have to do,"" Johnson said, quoting the survivor.

The survivor said it wasn't until the end of Bible study when the suspect just started shooting, according to Johnson. The survivor said the suspect loaded his gun about five times.

The survivor, who is elderly, who spoke with Johnson and her 5-year-old granddaughter are two of the three people who survived the shooting. According to Johnson, when the gunman saw the elderly woman was alive, he asked her, ""Did I shoot you?""

When the elderly woman said ""No,"" the gunman said, ""Good, because I need someone to survive,"" and said he was going to shoot himself, the survivor told Johnson. ""And you'll be the only survivor.""

The alleged gunman, 21-year-old Roof, was arrested Thursday in Shelby, North Carolina.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/charleston-shooting-good-samaritans-911-call-led-dylann/story?id=31870213,"A North Carolina woman's 911 call this morning brought an end to a desperate manhunt for Dylann Roof, the alleged gunman authorities say is responsible for killing nine people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church Wednesday night.

Early this morning, police released pictures from surveillance footage showing Roof, 21, as well as the car he was driving.

Debbie Dills, a bookkeeper who works at a florist shop in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, was leaving church in her car when she looked over and saw a driver next to her with a bowl haircut, she told ABC News.

Dills said she then thought there was something about the car that she had heard about somewhere, but couldn't place it. She then spotted the white tag that was in the police description of the shooting suspect.

The observant good Samaritan called her husband and then 911.

Police in Shelby -- about 13 miles west of Kings Mountain where Dills works and 245 miles north of the Charleston church -- said they were informed at 10:32 a.m. today ""that a business had contacted them of a possible sighting of the suspect from the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting traveling into Shelby.""

At 10:44 a.m., Roof was apprehended at a traffic stop in Shelby. He was taken into custody five minutes later, police said.

Roof cooperated with the officer who stopped him, according to police.

""I am so pleased we were able to resolve this case quickly,"" Charleston police Chief Greg Mullen said at a news conference.

A court clerk confirmed to ABC News this afternoon that Roof waived extradition in North Carolina and is cleared to return to South Carolina.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/confederate-flag-flying-south-carolina-capitol-grounds-provokes/story?id=31863705,"Commentators on social media are calling for the Confederate flag that remained flying outside South Carolina's state house this afternoon after nine people were shot dead at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, to be removed on the grounds that it is ""insulting"" to the victims of the shooting.

Gov. Nikki Haley, who was in tears during a news conference this morning on the mass shooting at the historically black church, previously rejected the notion of removing the flag at a debate last year, saying it was a ""sensitive issue"" but that she didn't believe the flag presented an image problem for the state because she never had ""one conversation with a single CEO about the Confederate flag.”

Haley's press secretary told ABC News today, ""In South Carolina, the governor does not have legal authority to alter the flag. Only the General Assembly can do that.""

The offices of South Carolina's General Assembly and South Carolina Lt. Gov. Henry D. McMaster did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for comment.

South Carolina, which is one of five states that still doesn't have a state hate crime law, recently celebrated ""Confederate Memorial Day"" this past May, during which a large Confederate flag was displayed on the steps of the South Carolina State Capitol.

Many object to the flying of the Confederate flag, which some say recalls the South's support for slavery during the Civil War. Supporters say it's a symbol of southern heritage.

The governor and the state is now under fire on social media, where many are linking the state's acceptance of the Confederate flag to the Charleston shooting, which is being investigated as a federal ""hate crime,"" according to federal authorities.

There were over 36,600 tweets with the word ""Confederate flag"" over the past day, according to Twitter analytic service, Topsy.

The Southern Poverty Law Center also tweeted a photo of a man believed to be 21-year-old Charleston shooting suspect, Dylann Roof, on a car with a Confederate Flag license plate.

Dalton Tyler, who said he has known Roof for seven months to one year, said he saw the white, 21-year-old suspect just last week.

“He was big into segregation and other stuff,” Tyler said. “He said he wanted to start a civil war. He said he was going to do something like that and then kill himself.”

Tyler said he met Roof, a Lexington, South Carolina native, through a good friend. He also said Roof’s parents, with whom he said the suspect was “on and off,” had previously bought him a gun but never allowed him to take it with him until this past week.

Dylan Roof’s grandfather, Joe Roof, declined to comment to ABC News.

Police said Roof was arrested today at a traffic stop in Shelby, North Carolina, about 250 miles north of Charleston.

A citizen saw the suspect’s car and reported it to police, who responded and made the arrest, police said. Roof cooperated with the officer who stopped him, according to police.

Cover up their identity. They tend to use their own vehicles. So he had great photographs great car description. In an outrageous crime so the combination of those. Tends to get the public to help you that I think that's exactly what happened. A citizen called police and said look I think your suspect. Is this particular location. The police then approached the vehicle or did a car stop. I guess he was cooperative based on what the police chief in Charleston said earlier. So now they have him in custody I presume at this point they're interviewing. Him Brad we have seen all humanity out mass shootings in this country what deet tails. About this one stand apart from the UN and what can that tell us about the shooter. All you'll one of the most eerie parts of this mass shooting is the key timepiece. With the victims. Prior to shooting them I mean typically mass shooters walk in the locations. Start shooting. Either shoot themselves get shot or leave. In his case he stayed there Daryn has Bible study or our worship gathering small group of people. Hi Cindy interacted with them but he had that intimate eye to eye contact with a small group of people. And then pulls out a gun and shoots all of them claiming it's a different level in my professional view. The distance the run of the mill mass shooter that shoots anybody that's in his path. Bradford told he. Was arrested without incident he didn't fight and that's surprising. A lot to a certain extent I mean it it's an announcement here's a presumption that it was going to kill himself either what do waited for the scene she'd finished. Be in a shootout with the police. Are he would've left the scene and taken his own life. The idea that he fled and was. All the way to North Carolina before he got caught. In a suggests that. He doesn't want to die any probably wants to tell this story. And that's going to be a big advantage at least for the next few hours the police giving it full and complete statement from him as too. What he did and why he did it. So you know each should urge kind of takes a different bit and his particular case it wasn't. To take his own life or force the police to shoot him during arrest.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/charleston-shooting-church-steeped-history/story?id=31849423,"The South Carolina church that was the site of Wednesday night’s massacre is steeped in historic significance stretching from slavery to the civil rights movement.

Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, built in 1891, is the oldest of its kind in the South and is listed among the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places.

The place of worship, led by the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, turned into a crime scene when police say a gunman opened fire during a regularly scheduled prayer group. Nine people have been confirmed dead and the shooter remains at large.

Emanuel AME Church, known locally as ""Mother Emanuel,"" played a large role in the development of the city's religious community for African-Americans in the late 1700s and early 1800s, according to their website.

David Goldman/AP Photo

The original church was associated with a planned slave revolt in the 1820s and the building was burned down during that time.

One of the church founders, Denmark Vesey, organized the revolt, but authorities foiled the plot, which created ""mass hysteria"" in the area, the website said.

Vesey was among 35 who were arrested and executed as a result, the Parks Service said.

The church’s website states that it held underground worship services from 1834 through 1865, during which time African-American churches were outlawed.

In 1865, the church was formally recognized and it took the name ""Emanuel.""

Roughly a century later it was also a flashpoint for controversy.

Civil rights activist Coretta Scott King led an estimated crowd of 1,500 demonstrators to the church in an April 1969 protest, according to ""Civil Rights in South Carolina: From Peaceful Protests to Groundbreaking Rulings."" The demonstrators faced national guardsmen with fixed bayonets.

King was not arrested, the book states, but the church's pastor was, along with 900 others.

“Any death of this sort is a tragedy. Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy,” the president said at the White House. “There is something particularly heart breaking about a death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace, in a place of worship.”

The president acknowledged the frustration he feels over the frequency in which mass shootings occur in the United States.

""I don’t need to be constrained about the emotions that tragedies like this raise. I've had to make statements like this too many times,"" he said. “We don’t have all the facts but we do know that once again innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting a gun.”

The president said he and First Lady Michelle Obama personally knew Rev. Clementa Pinckney, one of the nine people killed in the church massacre.

“To say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families and community doesn’t say enough to communicate the heartache, sadness and anger that we feel,” he said. ""Mother Emmanuel is in fact more than a church. This was a place of worship founded by African-Americans seeking liberty.""

Vice President Joe Biden, fighting back tears, stood alongside the president as he spoke.

""Hate has once again been let loose in an American community. And the senseless actions of a coward have once again cut short so many lives with so much promise,"" the vice president and his wife Dr. Jill Biden said in a statement. ""Our hearts ache with sorrow with the entire Emanuel AME Church family as they seek solace and comfort in the shadow of a gunman’s act of pure evil and hatred. Our love and prayers are with them.""

Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have called members of the Charleston, South Carolina community in the wake of the shooting.

The FBI identified 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof as the suspected gunman that opened fire inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church Wednesday night, taking the life of nine people -- three women and six men.

In a news conference earlier, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced a suspect was in custody.

“Acts like this one have no place in our country and no place in a civilized society,"" Lynch said. ""The individual who committed these acts will be found and will face justice.”

Roof was arrested at a traffic stop in Shelby, North Carolina.

Officials have called the act a ""hate crime,"" and the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the FBI have launched a hate crime investigation. It was the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. since 12 people were killed at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. in September 2013.",abcnews.com,True

Here is a timeline of what happened:

WEDNESDAY, AROUND 8 p.m.

Police said the alleged gunman, identified Thursday as Dylann Roof, was attending a bible study group with other worshipers at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church.

Charleston Police Department

WEDNESDAY, 9:05 p.m.

After spending almost an hour with the group, the suspect stood up and started shooting.

Nine people were killed, including Rev. Clementa Pinckney -- a church pastor and a South Carolina state senator. Six other victims were identified as Rev. Sharonda Singleton, retired pastor Dr. Daniel L. Simmons, Ethel Lee Lance, Cynthia Hurd, Myra Thompson and recent college graduate Tywanza Sanders. Police said three of the victims were men and six women. Their ages were unclear.

Some people did survive, but their identities have not been released.

""It is senseless,"" Charleston police Chief Greg Mullen said. ""It is unfathomable that somebody would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives.""

Early this morning, police released pictures from surveillance footage showing the suspect as well as the car he was driving, police said.

Officials then identified the alleged gunman as 21-year-old Dylann Roof.

Charleston police Chief Greg Mullen said eight people were found dead inside the church after the shooting unfolded at the Emanuel AME Church around 9 p.m. Two other people were rushed to the hospital, where one died, making it the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since 12 people were killed inside the Washington Navy Yard in September 2013.

The alleged gunman, identified as Dylann Roof, 21, was arrested today in North Carolina at a traffic stop.

The Rev. Clementa Pinckney, church pastor and a South Carolina state senator, was among the dead. Six other victims were identified as Rev. Sharonda Singleton, retired pastor Dr. Daniel L. Simmons, Ethel Lee Lance, Cynthia Hurd, Myra Thompson and recent college graduate Tywanza Sanders.

""It is senseless,"" Mullen said at a news conference Wednesday evening. ""It is unfathomable that somebody would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives.""

The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a hate crime investigation.

Authorities confirmed that there were survivors who were inside the church at the time of the shooting. It was unclear how many survived.

Charleston Mayor Joe Riley said, “The only reason someone would walk into church and shoot people praying is hate.”

He met with some of the families and described it as the ""most heart-breaking scene I have ever witnessed.""

U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement today: ""There are bad people in this world who are motivated by hate. Every decent person has been victimized by the hateful, callous disregard for human life shown by the individual who perpetrated these horrible acts. Our sense of security and well-being has been robbed and shaken.""

The NAACP also expressed its condolences for the families of the victims.

""The NAACP was founded to fight against racial hatred and we are outraged that 106 years later, we are faced today with another mass hate crime,"" NAACP president Cornell William Brooks said. ""There is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people engaged in the study of scripture.""

Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, built in 1891, is the oldest of its kind in the South, according to their website.

It is listed among the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places.

The house of worship, led by Pinckney, has played a role in the civil rights movement. Coretta Scott King led an estimated group of 1,500 demonstrators there during a protest in 1969 and they faced down national guardsmen, according to reports of the incident.

Outside the Courtyard Marriott, down the street from the church, a group of pastors gathered to pray.

""We need that peace, Lord,"" members of the prayer circle were heard saying. ""We need that peace you talk about in your word.""

Rev. Dr. Norvel Goff Sr., presiding elder for the AME’s Edisto District, which includes Emanuel AME Church, said a prayer service is scheduled for noon at Morris Brown AME Church in Charleston.

Goff said he wasn’t aware of any recent threats against the church.

Good morning, America. Breaking news, deadly church shooting. Tragedy in Charleston. At least nine people killed overnight in a massacre in an historic black church. I do believe it was a hate crime. Police say this suspect, a white man in his 20s walked into the bible study, sat down with the group and opened fire. This is the most unspeakable and heartbreaking tragedy. The pastor, a popular state senator among the victims. Incredible survival stories emerging. We got two people coming out, an adult female and a child. They were found in the room. They need to get checked out. A woman allowed to live to tell the story and a 5-year-old making it out by playing dead. The FBI on the scene. A massive manhunt for the killer under way right now. A city grieving and on edge this morning. Announcer: Live in times square, this is ""Good morning America."" And good morning, America. You are looking at the scene of that deadly massacre. Mother Emanuel ame church, Charleston, South Carolina, it looks peaceful now but between 8:00 and 9:00 a gunman walked in, joined the group and suddenly opened fire and police have just released these surveillance photos of the suspect calling him armed and dangerous. Here's what we know right now. At least nine people are dead. One other taken to the hospital. The gunman is still on the loose and described as being in his early 20s. Police are considering this a hate crime and dozens of FBI agents have been dispatched to help hunt down the killer. South Carolina, the entire south reeling right now because this mother EE Emanuel ame church, one of the oldest black churches in the south. Look at this photo of martin Luther king. He spoke there in 1962. It became a center for organizing during the civil rights movement. So many in church it could be violated this way and ABC's Steve osunsami is on the scene in Charleston, good morning, Steve. Reporter: Good morning to you, George. This church isirectly behind me. The steeple right there, the streets are blocked off here as they search through garage bins and back alleys apparently looking for something this gunman might have dropped. A painful day for families only made worse by the fact this happened at a place of worship. This morning, families here are grieving and praying for the dead. It is unfathomable that somebody in today's society would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives. Reporter: And what one city official is describing as a targeted attack, a white gunman stormed into a bible study at Emanuel ame, a historically black church that has remained in the heart of Charleston's restaurant and entertainment district. Nine church members died right before god, another wounded. I do believe this was a hate crime. Reporter: Moments ago police released this photo of the alleged gunman taken at the area of the shooting. He's described by police as a 21 to 25-year-old white male wearing a distinctive sweatshirt, blue jeans and timberland boots and say he was driving a getaway vehicle with a unique front license. They're asking for the public's help in bringing him in. This morning he's still on the run. Overnight a massive manhunt. The FBI and the ATF joining in the investigation. Apparently we have someone running around armed. Reporter: A bomb threat called in mopes after the shooting made things worse forcing familieses and tourists to leave the area. These people were in church. They were in church. Reporter: Families of the victims who came together a few blocks away tell ABC news the suspect walked into the church and sat down during part of a bible study class before suddenly standing up and firing his gun. This is the most unspeakable and heartbreaking tragedy. Reporter: At 9:05 P.M. Police rushed to the scene. We got two people coming out, an adult female and a child. They were found in the room. They need to get checked out. Reporter: One is the pastor of the church, 41-year-old senator clementa pinckney who earned distinction as the youngest african-american state lawmaker in South Carolina history. Earlier in the day the passion tore had been campaigning with Hillary Clinton. Pinckney leaves a wife and two children. One of the survivors is a 5-year-old, police say, who played dead when the shooting started. It is a heartbreaking scene I have never witnessed in my life. Reporter: According to one state representative, the gunman told a female survivor he would let her go so she could tell everyone what happened. This is the oldest ame church in the south and will certainly go down as one of the deadliest attacks against a black church in U.S. History. Amy? All right, Steve, thank you for that latest update. Joining us with more on the manhunt is ABC news consult apartment and former FBI special agent, brad Garrett and, brad, we've seen the surveillance images. They are everywhere this morning. How soon before police get their guy? I think shortly. Amy, I mean you got great pictures, a unique tag, a car description, and he wanted everybody to know that he did it. I mean, he leaves one person alive to spread the word. So this guy is going to get caught or they're going to find him dead. He is a young white male and among the many chilling details, he came into church, sat down and attended part of the bible study before he opened fire. What do we know about who this man is and what his motivation may have been? Well, he goes into the church, Amy, to sit down because he wants to put them at ease and he also wants to look them in the eye which makes this even more personal before he opens fire. He's been described as extremely dangerous. How likely is it that he would try something again? Is the community still at risk here? I think the big issue is going to be cornering him, arresting him or finding him. I'm not sure that he's going to go attack maybe another church. This guy is now on the run if he's still alive. All right, brad Garrett, thank you for the very latest. We're learning more about the victims now. We know there were three males, six female victims inside the church. I want to go to Pierre Thomas our chief justice correspondent there describing this as a hate crime, Pierre. Hate crimes across the south on the rise. Very much so, George.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/rachel-dolezal-timeline-naacp-leaders-transition-white-black/story?id=31801772,"The confusing web of contradictions that led to accusations of racism and questions of racial identity appear to have resulted in the resignation of an NAACP leader in Spokane, Washington, who has now spoken out about the controversy.

Rachel Dolezal’s history came under scrutiny when her white parents told a reporter last week she is Caucasian and they do not understand why she is identifying as black.

Here is a rough timeline of her transition from a pale young girl with blond hair to a darker-skinned leader in the country’s oldest civil rights organization.

KXLY

Her Childhood

Rachel Dolezal was born and raised in Montana by parents Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal. Her parents told ABC News they also adopted African-American children with whom Rachel was raised.

Though it was not visibly apparent at the time, Dolezal has identified as black since she was about 5-years-old, she now says.

“I was drawing self-portraits with the brown crayon instead of the peach crayon,” she said on the “Today” this morning.

When asked specifically about how she would classify herself when she was a teen, while looking at a photo of herself, Dolezal told NBC, “visibly, she would be identified as white by people who see her.”

KXLY

African-American Academia

When it came time for college, Lawrence Dolezal said his daughter purposefully chose to attend universities that placed significant emphasis on race.

""She went to Belhaven College in Jackson, Mississippi, to be part of a racial reconciliation community development project which was an open expression to the community of Jackson, Mississippi, that blacks and whites could live in harmony together and be fully reconciled,"" Lawrence said to ABC News of the private Christian university. ""She did that for four years at Jackson before she went to Howard.""

ABC News

Dolezal, then known as Rachel Moore, was awarded a scholarship to attend Howard University in Washington, D.C., one of the country's best-known historically black universities.

She later filed a suit against the school, saying she was denied a teaching assistant position 14 years ago based on race, among other factors, according to the judgment from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which upheld a dismissal of her suit by a lower court. The court noted that the chairman did not learn of her interest in an assistantship until after he says he had filled all of the positions.

At Howard University in Washington, D.C., according to the 2005 order, Moore claimed ""discrimination based on race, pregnancy, family responsibilities and gender"" while she was a graduate student in art.

She also claimed her artwork was removed from a student exhibition in 2001 to ""favor African-American students over Moore,"" the June 14, 2005, the order says. The order said that the statute of limitations had expired on this claim.

Dolezal defended her decision to file a lawsuit against the school.

“The reasons for my full-tuition scholarship being removed and my teaching position as well, my TA position, were that other people needed opportunities and, ‘You probably have white relatives that can afford to help you with your tuition’ and I thought that was an injustice,” she said on “Today.”

The Appeals Court judgment noted that while “she did not follow the normal application process for obtaining a scholarship in her second year, she in fact was awarded a scholarship in September 2001 for the entire 2001-2002 year.” And in regards to a teaching position following graduation, she “did not apply for an advertised faculty position; rather, she dropped off her resume and a cover letter… (that) acknowledged her understanding that no teaching positions were then available”.

Howard University issued a statement saying it ""considers this matter closed and has no further comment.""

Dolezal started working as a part-time professor in the Africana studies program at Eastern Washington University in 2010 but a spokesman told ABC News that she is no longer employed by the university.

Spokesman Dave Meany said she was hired on a quarter-by-quarter basis and the school's most recent quarter ended Friday, so her contract expired, ""as previously scheduled,"" he said.

He declined to comment on whether she would be rehired in the fall. Dolezal has not responded to ABC News’ requests for comment.

Her New Life – and Look

Her adopted siblings spoke to ABC News about how they saw her shift, as they say she made it clear that she did not want people knowing about her past.

“She took me aside… and told me to make sure that no one found out where she was actually from and for me not to blow her cover,” Ezra Dolezal told ABC News.

Her adoptive brother Zachariah Dolezal said that her shift in appearance came in stages over time.

“It started with her hair, then she’d probably have a little darker tan,” he said. “It was very progressive.”

When it came time for her to explain her changing look on “Today,” she offered few specifics, saying only that she “certainly [doesn’t] stay out of the sun.”

Facebook

Leading in Washington State

Dolezal has been a civil rights activist in her adopted home of Spokane, Washington, and, subsequently, was elected as the chapter president of the NAACP late last year.

The group even shared a photo of Dolezal and an older black man who they identified as her father, saying he would be attending her swearing-in ceremony.

[

President Dolezal's father announced today that he will be coming to town for the January 19th ribbon-cutting ceremony... Posted by Spokane NAACP on Tuesday, January 13, 2015

She addressed her decision to introduce that man, who has been identified as Albert Wilkerson, as her father, even though he is not her biological father.

“He actually approached me in North Idaho and we just kind of connected on a very intimate level as family,” she said during the “Today” interview.

“Albert Wilkerson is my dad. Any man can be a father, not every man can be a dad,” she said.

Hate Crimes

Over the past few years, Dolezal reportedly filed several reports of hate crimes with police saying that her family has been harassed eight times, according to ABC affiliate station KXLY-TV in Spokane.

One of the incidents included her alleged discovery of a noose in her garden, and Dolezal also said she most recently received a packet of hateful letters at the NAACP's post office box.

She addressed questions about whether those threats were real during a KXLY interview.

KXLY: People hear that you have a key [to the post office box] and know that you've been victimized before. What would you say to the folks that say maybe you put that letter in there because you were one of the people that had the keys to do so?

Dolezal: ""I don't know that I even have any words for that. Because as a mother of two black sons I would never terrorize my children, and I don't know any mother, personally, that that would trump up or fabricate something that severe, that would affect her kids. My son had slept for two weeks in my bed after we received a package. And he's thirteen years old -- that's the kind of terror, that I as a mother, and my son, as a black male thirteen-year-old in Spokane, never needs to experience.""

KXLY

What’s Next

In addition to stepping down as the Spokane chapter president on Monday, she no longer has her job at Eastern Washington University.

She is also the subject of an investigation by the city ethics commission trying to determine whether she lied about her race on her application to join the police oversight board. KXLY reported that she identified herself as white, black and American Indian on the application.",abcnews.com,True

Tonight, the story that still has the the internet abuzz at this hour. It is the woman who for years built a personal and professional life around the notion she is a black woman. That is until a couple claiming to be her decidedly nonblack parents came forward to say they had no idea what she is talking about. Through all of the struggle, through all of the pain, we still rise. The curious case of Rachel Dolezal. The work that we are doing is so necessary. And essential. Today not so much. A shocking revelation, sparked a national debate with allegations. This 37-year-old has been posing as black for a decade. Here she is in photos presented by her family. A teenager. Yes, I do kid mysconsider myself to be back. This Montana couple say they are her real parents and told us both european descent of no known traces of african-american heritage. Rachel is clearly white as we are. She has not ex-plannplained why she has disguised herself and been deceptive about her ethnicity the way she has tried to represent herself as some one who she is not. That's what its concerning to us. Dolezal went to Howard university as a graduate student and hired as part time professor in Washington teaching africaner studies. When it comes to hair, hair is for black women much more than just an aesthetic. She should know often experimenting with natural hair styles. She is an artist painting works that depect the struggles of people of color. Some priced for more than $10,000. Art work featured in the video. We have older white men on our currency. What does that do to us as an image, it is part of our history. Here on this application for city job with Spokane police commission she declared herself as three races, white, black, native American. The Spokane chapter, posted a picture of Rachel and this man who she said was her father. Claiming he couldn't visit Spokane because he was battling bone cancer. A local reporter from affiliate KXLY confronted her. Is that your dad? Yeah, that's my dad. This man right here is your father? Right there? Do you have a question about that? Yes, ma'am, I was wondering if your dad really is an african-american man? That's a very, I don't know what you are implying? Are you african-american? I don't understand the question of -- I did tell you yes that's my dad. And he was unable to come in January. Are your parents -- are they white? Her parents say she grew distant from them as she took hn her new identity. She rejected us. She has asked us not to come to her area. Her parents claim Rachel was always interested in diversity and black culture. The Dolezal family adopted four black children and Rachel later married a black man and had a child. The couple is now divorced. Apparently Rachel said she is estranged from her parents due to legal dispute. In an interview, with the ""Seattle times,"" Rachel dodged questions about her ethnicity. There is a lot of complexity. I don't know everyone would understand that. The controversy set the internet ablaze on Twitter angry users twigt under #trendracial. One user saying my problem with transracial, black folks can't decide to be white when the cops raid the pool partyable. A white woman can be a naacp president. We know Rachel's name. This is a person who made a choice to misrepresentative themselves. In so many ways assuming a black identity paid off. To be black in America, it actually has costs, not payoffs. Others united under ask Rachel asking humorous hypothetical questions. If your mama brought you into this world what else can she do? Take you out, B, buy you a kente cloth, C, make you lunch. A funny scenario. You have a person pretending to be african-american leading a group that is designed to help african-americans. Question as but Rachel's Dolezal's racial identity came to light when she reported to police she was being targeted for being black, victim of a hate crime. Recounting the story in this youtube video. We actually received a package in the mail that was a 20-page, lengthy, manifesto, including photos of lynchings, photos of myself, other forms of death threats. Spokane police say they have found any evidence and have halted their investigation. Posing as a race other than your own isn't anything new. Historically it was more common for black people to pose as white because of racial discrimination. But increasingly the trend is shifting. If you look at the case with iggy azalea. She is a caricature of what a black woman represents. If you look at Mclemore, the year he won the grammys, it's not far-fetched for some one who decide to be white to embrace an african-american persona. In 1998, the then 22-year-old indian-american, estranged brother of Mindy, shocked his family, by posing as a black man to get into medical school. Fool's gold he later regretted. I was desperate to go to medical school. It was not a social experiment. I hid it for 15 years. I didn't want the world to know what I did. My own sister said telling the story would bring shame on the family. I understand the family pressure associated with lying about your race. He couldn't stick with the lie. Vijay ended up dropping out. When you accept some one who is not qualified because of their race, sometimes they don't succeed. Which is what happened to me. He said Rachel's case highlights a bigger issue. If everyone can lie about their race on their application, then affirmative action will fall apart like a house of cards. Now he is an admissions consultant and author and believes what he did was wrong. People were very angry. I think a lot of the people have faced a lot of racism in their lives. For lacy Schwartz, seeing Dolezal's reaction, elicited strong reactions. The fact is that her parents outed her to the media as not being black. You have to wonder why would they even do that? Schwartz, 38 is biracial but thought she was white until she was 18 when her mother confessed she lied to Schwartz awful her life. I grew up actually believing I was white. I thought I was who my family was. We had our explanations why I looked the way I did. But the rest of the world that didn't seem to hold up. Whatever happened with you and daddy. She made a film called ""Little white lie."" She fields one's racial identity can be fluid. However the story ends, what does it say about how this nation still views racial identity? Based on the strong response to stories this got. Racial identity in this country is still incredibly binary, a strong divide between black and white. In the whack ake of the controversy, the naacp is standing by their leader, one's racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for naacp leadership. As for Rachel Dolezal she has not spoken with ABC news on the record about the situation. She maintains to the ""Seattle times"" that we are all from the african continent.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/rachel-dolezal-asked-fathers-race-interview-abcs-spokane/story?id=31727573,"Rachel Dolezal, the president of Spokane, Washington's NAACP chapter, has been in the spotlight ever since she walked away mid-interview from ABC affiliate KXLY in Spokane Wednesday when asked if her parents are white.

When applying for a spot on Spokane’s Police Ombudsman Commission -- of which she is now chairwoman -- Dolezal identified herself as white, black and American Indian, KXLY reported.

But Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal told KXLY that Dolezal is their biological daughter and they are both white.

According to KXLY, Dolezal reported several hate crimes to police over the past few years. In Wednesday's interview with KXLY reporter Jeff Humphrey, Dolezal said her family has been harassed eight times, including an incident when her sons found ""what looked like a noose"" in their garden.

Dolezal said she most recently received a packet of hateful letters at the NAACP's post office box.

The KXLY interview was in response to the hate crime reports.

Late Friday, police said they were suspending the investigation into the letters because there were no new leads, the affiliate reported.

Here is a portion of Dolezal's interview with KXLY, before it came to an abrupt end:

KXLY

KXLY: People hear that you have a key [to the post office box] and know that you've been victimized before. What would you say to the folks that say maybe you put that letter in there because you were one of the people that had the keys to do so?

Dolezal: ""I don't know that I even have any words for that. Because as a mother of two black sons I would never terrorize my children, and I don't know any mother, personally, that that would trump up or fabricate something that severe, that would affect her kids.

My son had slept for two weeks in my bed after we received a package. And he's thirteen years old -- that's the kind of terror, that I as a mother, and my son, as a black male thirteen-year-old in Spokane, never needs to experience.""

...

KXLY: Is that your Dad?

Dolezal: ""Yeah, that's my dad.""

KXLY: This man right here is your father? Right there?

Dolezal: ""You have a question about that?""

KXLY: Yes, ma'am. I was wondering if your Dad really is an African American man?

Dolezal: ""That's a very, I mean I don’t I don't know what you're implying.""

KXLY: Are you African-American?

Dolezal: ""I don't, I don't understand the question. I did tell you that, yes, that's my dad. And he was unable to come in January.""

KXLY: Are your parents, are they white?

Dolezal: ""I refuse."" Dolezal walks away and turns off her mic.

While the NAACP is backing Dolezal, the city of Spokane said Thursday it is investigating whether her claims regarding her ethnicity violated any city policies.

ABC News' attempts to reach Rachel, Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal today were unsuccessful.

Rachel delusional has become the new face of the areas civil rights movement. According to do for all striving for equality is made her a target for numerous hate crimes. Is highly frustrating it's been. Starts in years. And certainly. Doesn't mom out of of stress for my kids as well as myself. Don't calls says she's been victimized more than a dozen times in both Spokane and portal lane including the appearances of new uses around homes. Yet police have made no arrests. There's been no conclusion and any of these incidents with this that have resulted in a suspect's. And now it's delusional her self who's under scrutiny in numerous postings in public appearances.

Our photographer dutifully returned them is delusional hid inside this clothing store. And other it was Spokane affiliate KXLY. Reporter Jeff Humphrey conducting that interview joined that story and joining me now is. A Darnell Moore a senior editor at Mike news Darnell I think we can we can agree can stipulate. This is weird right take a spot. What was your initial reaction when you heard about this. This morning my initial reaction was how ironic is it that someone who has spent a substantial part of her career who working on issues. Injustice. On behalf of black people. How this story has in so many ways distracted us from the very issues as he fights for that was the first thought that I. You know so how is it possible that that someone who's fighting and again apparently against police brutality and the Mormon win its mentality is a big issue in our country. That story like this not expressed an it. You would you you went on in the article you wrote on might news today to say this is the case. Of white. Privilege. In action and a best tickets going a bit farther then then your statement here. White privilege meaning what I think it it's it's it it's pretty much simplifying what I said just a minute ago that in other words. Here we have a story about a woman a white woman those self identifies with black that is now. It isn't just about you know a white woman in as much about whiteness in general. That's sort of suffocate the room it's taken up so much space that the issues again that she would have otherwise been talking about we're not talking about right now we're talking about Rachel dozing up. We're not talking about police brutality which is one of the issues that she focused on we're not talking even about the the various racial incidents that she encountered we're talking about. A white woman who is self identified as black that is an example of the ways that might from the top Kuwait is if Matt doesn't -- say more about costs. The citizenry. The media and about anything that cheated oh on an off and I and my critique when I went out when I make a critique about the with a weapon which work if it's not necessarily. Her in as much as what the public feeds on. Just two days ago we were talking about a fourteen year old black girl who was assaulted by the McKinney police officer whose names many of us still don't know right. Two days after that we're now in the middle middle of the media fire storm centered on again. Where two of those those who's a white woman. Who is is this is. It you know identified as black. And that story is central and in the public discourse right now I think we should be asking questions not only about that there's some question to be acts about her her intent. That's fair but I do think we should take stock of what stories as a public we actually feed into and which we don't. But McDonough is there something. Arguably. Wrong quote unquote about. Eight white person or this white person claiming to be or trying to be are posing yes. An African American that we said we should state here that this was the choice. That's in at a chili's too so this misrepresent herself. On application it's. Regardless of if those questions that have been acts of are not. We don't know the reason why should meet those choices I do think that there's something be said we we talk a lot about cultural appropriation. But yeah I do want to say. You know black folk in America. It pays write in for for her to pay positively. To it to sort of adopt this identity of blackness but spoken America generally I think in the moment we're talking about so much inequity would say that it cost actually to be black in America. But she wasn't just reaping the benefits for example a scholarship that she got an Arab university which you apparently was fighting the fight as they asked the candidates NAACP. Local branch absolutely and that's the thing that that I say here we have a personal growth of house who identifies with fighting. Now I think it made it says to me. That the very issue she fights about would act which it which are at the heart of of of a national debate right now on racial issues racial politics in this country we've lost that we we've lost that in a conversation somewhere. That is what I mean by this that the notion of white privilege as a distracting point taken at the way from the real issues that she herself was fighting for. Opulent let's let's look at the NAACP is I think the national office to map the statement releasing a statement today in support. Of proposal apparently a sport of reclaiming that. This a quote once racial identity is not a qualifying criteria. Or disqualifying. Standard for NAACP. Leadership NAACP. Alaska Oregon Washington State conference stands behind. Ms. totals addicts in record. Are critics being too hard on her. For claiming to be happening you know view of the oh Chris Rock joke that you know nobody no white person wants to be me and I'm rash. He appears he is trying to be something which in many cases. Here's a disadvantage in this source that are something to be said about what this incident the questions that it raises about. Race. And how we come to think about race and the finally certainly that a good conversations I had rate. We many of us do not necessary do not hold the belief that that blackness is something hereditary that's found in one's blood of that racist socially constructed. All these types of questions are coming out of this and I think that those are good now again I'm not concerned with. With what whether she did something wrong or even illegally. And as much as the intention behind. And the ways that that intention for you know this is if it of the triplets to assume. It passing is a fruitless. And I think that we sit we should talk about that and I think she what she should be able to give in. The amount of social into social justice is sushi spot on behalf. In regards to black folks' lives I think she should be able to to respond to some of these. Introvert briefly we should just ad here there's some economists seems to be some kind of family. Clash or just absolutely has yet or parents. Essentially. Conflicting with their apps undermining her battling her openness Ethel and you know I don't think there's there's there's a story looming death that we have not yet heard. Arm and I think that that's story's important. Okay just very very quickly just one question is does this give us not retreat to rethink. And re imagine race that we're seeing this term trans racial used right now very very well I'll I think many of us at welcome. The idea of of responding and think differently about race yes. Great thanks for joining us and you can keep. With the story in real.

""One's racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for NAACP leadership,"" the NAACP said in a statement today.

On the city application form, Dolezal identified herself as white, black and American Indian, ABC affiliate KXLY in Spokane reported. The city has said it is investigating whether her claims violated any city policies.

But Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal told KXLY that Dolezal is their biological daughter and they are both white.

When a KXLY reporter asked Rachel Dolezal Wednesday, ""Are your parents white?"" Dolezal removed her microphone and walked away, KXLY said.

ABC News' attempts to reach Rachel, Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal today were unsuccessful.

Amid it all, Dolezal became the center of a social media frenzy, and #RachelDolezal was the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter.

Reactions included anger over her possible misrepresentations -- but also apparent sympathy.

If someone white identifies themself as black and has to be subject to racism because of it, I doubt it's for selfish reasons #RachelDolezal — 800 Hertz (@800HertZZ) June 12, 2015

Some commenters even brought up the recent gender transformation of ex-Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, formerly Bruce Jenner.

If Bruce Jenner can decide he's a woman, why can't #RachelDolezal decide she's black? If biology doesn't determine identity... — Jim Treacher (@jtLOL) June 12, 2015

Even a celebrity weighed in.

We accept that a person can identify as transgender. Could 'trans-ethnic' be a real thing? #RachelDolezal — mia farrow (@MiaFarrow) June 12, 2015

Though Dolezal's application for the city position is being examined, her racial claims may not be an issue for the NAACP.

""For 106 years, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has held a long and proud tradition of receiving support from people of all faiths, races, colors and creeds,"" the group's statement said. ""NAACP Spokane Washington Branch President Rachel Dolezal is enduring a legal issue with her family, and we respect her privacy in this matter.

""The NAACP Alaska-Oregon-Washington State Conference stands behind Ms. Dolezal's advocacy record,"" the group added. ""In every corner of this country, the NAACP remains committed to securing political, educational and economic justice for all people, and we encourage Americans of all stripes to become members and serve as leaders in our organization.""

According to KXLY, Dolezal reported several hate crimes over the past few years, most recently saying she received a packet of hateful letters at the NAACP's post office box.

""Hate language sent through mail and social media along with credible threats continue to be a serious issue for our units in the Pacific Northwest and across the nation,"" the group said. ""We take all threats seriously and encourage the FBI and the Department of Justice to fully investigate each occurrence.""

The NAACP Spokane chapter led by Dolezal did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

Spokane Mayor David Condon and City Council President Ben Stuckart said in a statement: ""We are committed to independent citizen oversight and take very seriously the concerns raised regarding the chair of the independent citizen police ombudsman commission.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/excerpt-heretic-ayaan-hirsi-ali/story?id=29807824,"Excerpted from HERETIC: WHY ISLAM NEEDS A REFORMATION NOW by Ayaan Hirsi Ali by arrangement with Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers, Copyright © 2015 by Ayaan Hirsi Ali

Introduction: One Islam, Three Sets of Muslims

On ______, a group of ______ heavily armed, black-clad men burst into a ______ in ______, opening fire and killing a total of ______ people. The attackers were filmed shouting “Allahu akbar!”

Speaking at a press conference, President ______ said: “We condemn this criminal act by extremists. Their attempt to justify their violent acts in the name of a religion of peace will not, however, succeed. We also condemn with equal force those who would use this atrocity as a pretext for Islamophobic hate crimes.”

As I revised the introduction to this book, four months before its publication, I could of course have written something more specific, like this:

On January 7, 2015, two heavily armed, black-clad attackers burst into the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris, opening fire and killing a total of ten people. The attackers were filmed shouting “Allahu akbar!”

But, on reflection, there seemed little reason to pick Paris. Just a few weeks earlier I could equally as well have written this:

In December 2014, a group of nine heavily armed, black-clad men burst into a school in Peshawar, opening fire and killing a total of 145 people.

Indeed, I could have written a similar sentence about any number of events, from Ottawa, Canada, to Sydney, Australia, to Baga, Nigeria. So instead I decided to leave the place blank and the number of killers and victims blank, too. You, the reader, can simply fill them in with the latest case that happens to be in the news. Or, if you prefer a more historical example, you can try this:

In September 2001, a group of 19 Islamic terrorists flew hijacked planes into buildings in New York and Washington, D.C., killing 2,996 people.

For more than thirteen years now, I have been making a simple argument in response to such acts of terrorism. My argument is that it is foolish to insist, as our leaders habitually do, that the violent acts of radical Islamists can be divorced from the religious ideals that inspire them. Instead we must acknowledge that they are driven by a political ideology, an ideology embedded in Islam itself, in the holy book of the Qur’an as well as the life and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad contained in the hadith.

Let me make my point in the simplest possible terms: Islam is not a religion of peace. For expressing the idea that Islamic violence is rooted not in social, economic, or political conditions—or even in theological error—but rather in the foundational texts of Islam itself, I have been denounced as a bigot and an “Islamophobe.” I have been silenced, shunned, and shamed. In effect, I have been deemed to be a heretic, not just by Muslims—for whom I am already an apostate—but by some Western liberals as well, whose multicultural sensibilities are offended by such “insensitive” pronouncements.

My uncompromising statements on this topic have incited such vehement denunciations that one would think I had committed an act of violence myself. For today, it seems, speaking the truth about Islam is a crime. “Hate speech” is the modern term for heresy. And in the present atmosphere, anything that makes Muslims feel uncomfortable is branded as “hate.”

In these pages, it is my intention to make many people—not only Muslims but also Western apologists for Islam—uncomfortable. I am not going to do this by drawing cartoons. Rather, I intend to challenge centuries of religious orthodoxy with ideas and arguments that I am certain will be denounced as heretical. My argument is for nothing less than a Muslim Reformation. Without fundamental alterations to some of Islam’s core concepts, I believe, we shall not solve the burning and increasingly global problem of political violence carried out in the name of religion. I intend to speak freely, in the hope that others will debate equally freely with me on what needs to change in Islamic doctrine, rather than seeking to stifle discussion.",abcnews.com,True

Yosur Mohammad, 21, her husband Deah Barakat and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, were shot and killed on Tuesday, allegedly by neighbor Craig Stephen Hicks.

Hicks is accused of first-degree murder in the three deaths.

Yousef Abu-Salha, brother of the slain sisters, told ABC News he was humbled that President Barack Obama spoke out against the murders today, saying no one in America should be targeted ""because of who they are, what they look like or how they worship.""

""He actually said what’s on most of our minds. We do feel like Americans,"" Abu-Salha said.

Obama also quoted Yosur Mohammad, who said in a past interview that she felt growing up in America was ""a blessing.""

""She’s completely right and that’s why we live here and that’s why we’re so proud to be Americans and chase the American Dream,"" Abu-Salha said of his sister.

Abu-Salha said his sisters had always been able to fit in with those around them while growing up in America.

""She meshed very well in this culture,"" Abu-Salha said of Yosur Mohammad. ""I believe my sister really showed us in a positive light all over the world which is really needed at this time.""

Barakat was born in the U.S. and his family was from Syria. The sisters were of Jordanian descent.

Abu-Salha said he and his family were thankful for the outpouring of support, which has helped the devastated family, based in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Abu-Salha said his family expected to receive a call from Obama later tonight.

Hicks remains in jail on charges of first-degree murder. He has not yet entered a plea.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/chapel-hill-shooting-alleged-shooter-long-frustrated-parking/story?id=28948627,"The man accused of shooting and killing three people near the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill was studying to be a paralegal and had multiple run-ins with neighbors over parking, according to various media reports.

Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, was arrested Tuesday after allegedly shooting newly married couple Deah Barakat and Yusor Mohammad and Mohammad’s sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. All three were Muslim.

Police have said that the preliminary investigation suggests the killings stemmed from a dispute over parking, but the victims’ families and others have called for the crime to be investigated as a hate crime, which police say is part of their probe.

In a news conference his week, Hick's wife Karen Hicks said she did not think the crime was motivated by any bias against the victim’s backgrounds or beliefs.

Little is known about the alleged shooter, but his social media activity may help to fill in some of the blanks.

Craig Stephen Hicks identified himself on Facebook as an atheist and ridiculed different religions, including Christianity and Islam. He also put up a post in which he appeared to identify as an ally of the LGBTQ community.

He also posted a picture last month appearing to show his loaded hand gun. Hicks had a concealed weapons permit, according to the Associated Press.

Hicks posted a picture of himself in December with the description: “Modern me; same ugly, stupid, fat person with less hair now.”

Karen Hicks' lawyer, Robert Maitland, said the alleged shooter had long been focused on parking issues with multiple neighbors before the incident. Karen Hicks also told reporters she would be divorcing her husband.

While both a local and federal investigation is ongoing, it might be difficult for authorities to prove the killings were a hate crime, experts say.

Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, explains that a hate crime is defined as a pre-existing crime that ""has been motivated in whole or in part by a hatred of a particular group.""

Potok notes that not all states cover the same groups, for example some states will not prosecute a hate crime based on sexual orientation, but under a 2009 law, the federal government can also investigate or prosecute a hate crime

Potok said it is generally dfficult to prove a hate crime, because motive and state of mind can often be murky things to get a handle on. Potok said, for example, if someone gets into a fistfight because he or she is angry over somethiing and then uses a racial slur, it may not mean they committed a hate crime.

Additionally, he points out, prosecutors may believe the evidence of a hate crime is not definitive enough.

“Then they could decide, ‘Look we have this guy on triple homicide. He’ll never get out of prison alive. We don’t have the evidence to prove the hate crime,’” Potok said.

Hicks has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder and ordered held without bail. Attempts to contact his assigned public defender were not immediately successful. He has not entered a plea.",abcnews.com,True

Gunshots were reported after 5 p.m. in the Finley Forest condominiums in Chapel Hill, east of the University of North Carolina campus, police said.

He said Abu-Salah, from Raleigh, was visiting her sister.

A spokesman from the North Carolina State University said Abu-Salha was majoring in design and on the dean's list for the fall 2014 semester. The university spokesman said Barakat and Mohammad were alumnae of the school.

“We were married for seven years and that is one thing that I do know about him,"" Karen Hicks told reporters today. ""He often champions on his Facebook page for the rights of many individuals -- for same-sex marriages, abortion, race. He just believed -- I know that’s just one of the things I know about him is that everyone is just equal.”

Hicks' attorney Rob Maitland said his client had a ""longstanding issue"" with parking, saying, ""it has nothing to do with the religious faith"" of the victims.

“Unfortunately these victims were there at the wrong time at the wrong place,"" Maitland said.

""Our preliminary investigation indicates that the crime was motivated by an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking,"" Chapel Hill Police said in a statement. ""Hicks is cooperating with investigators and more information may be released at a later time.""

Police earlier said they were investigating whether the shooting was a hate crime. All three victims were Muslim.

Duke University’s Imam Abdullah Antepli said, “This may or may not be a hate crime,” adding that authorities have been “extremely helpful and supportive.”

U.S. Attorney in North Carolina Ripley Rand said, ""We don't have any information that this was a targeted campaign against Muslims in North Carolina.”

Two of the victims -- Deah Barakat, 23, a second-year student in UNC's School of Dentistry, and Yusor Mohammad, 21, a prospective dental student -- were married. Mohammad's sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, was a sophomore at North Carolina State University in Raleigh and was visiting her sister and brother-in-law, according to Deah Barakat's father.

Gunshots were reported after 5 p.m. Tuesday in the Finley Forest condominiums in Chapel Hill, east of the University of North Carolina campus.

Farris Barakat, Deah Barakat's brother, said Hicks had confronted his brother previously about a dispute over a parking space, adding that he never heard Hicks make any anti-Muslim remarks.

ABC News

When Farris Barakat had visited his brother, Hicks had yelled at him, telling him he was parking in the wrong space, Farris Barakat told ABC News. Farris Barakat added that he tried to respond in a calm manner, not wanting to upset Hicks further, and said his brother also treated Hicks in a respectful manner.

Hicks showed up at Barakat and Mohammad's home in the past with a gun on his belt, and Mohammad had confided that she was afraid of Hicks, Farris Barakat said. The two joked that maybe she should get a gun, he added.

The nation's largest Muslim civil rights organization, The Council on American-Islamic Relations, requested law enforcement authorities address speculation about a possible bias motive in the homicide.

Information about the shooting was heavily shared on social media, fueling hashtags such as #MuslimLivesMatter and #ChapelHillShooting to trend across the United States.",abcnews.com,True

A North Carolina man had been charged with the shooting death of three students at the university of north Carolina at Chapel Hill. Craig is Steven hicks forty features old now charged with three counts of first degree murder he was denied bail. Hello everyone analyst at her in new York and the victims of the shooting were dia shoddy that are hot his wife used to work for a cot and her sister. Resign Abu Sala all Muslim students now here with more on this case ABC's crime and terror analyst Brad Garrett good afternoon to you. First for folks who might not be up to speed what can you tell us about what we know so far. But the local media are reporting that. All of the Vick took the three victims. And the suspect. Live or stay in the same apartment complex. Apparently there were some sort of altercation in the parking lot. What's unclear is Hannity get from the parking lot to the apartment. Were the three victims were apparently shot. My sister would be that there is some history leader. That mr. hicks has had anger issues. Would one of the three or possibly all three. And there were some tipping point in recent hours that sent him over the edge. That we are hearing that as far as a motive is concerned that perhaps. This might be over a parking space or in ongoing need for dispute. As far as you know at this early juncture what are you hearing about the possible motive. Book. No clearly be the use the many people go too. Well was this some sort of religious intolerance shooting. Might be there's been nothing to their support that. Apparently according to mr. hicks FaceBook page. He was a very active atheist and really was sort of against are opposed it really all religions. He clearly made some comment on line in reference to. The the Muslim faith that quote unquote they started this an acute if they hadn't started it. We wouldn't have to get dollars. A pair phrasing of course. So in a what does that suggest is it it's really hard to assess screw but not against the law to make that statement. One of the important things they're gonna have to do is figure out if this will if this was motivated because of their religion. Now like goes into the hate crime area but you know it's really too early to it to sort of prepare and on that at this point. As funny you should bring that because I did be the press release that brief press release did note that police are looking into the possibility. That this was. Perhaps noted speeded by what they call eight. As far as what you know I know we don't know much at this point you've mentioned it. Is there enough evidence perhaps to go there that that hate crime charges are warranted in this case. Now it's entirely too early and and we'll tell you that. Hate crimes can be difficult true. Adding clearly. You've got the three potential first degree murder charges. That in I suspect could potentially. Carry the death penalty so. My sense would be that. Those are the authorities in Chapel Hill, North Carolina will move forward. On the three murder charges. And you know the feds will certainly come in with them and behind them to look at. The potential of a hate crime so conceivably he could be charged with that could license with previous is going to be. It much easier to pursue a murder case. Got to thank you so much ABC's Brad Garrett thank you for joining.

Hopkins, 39, gained nearly 50 pounds, hoping to turn around and quickly lose it, all while being filmed for the two-part special, ""Fat and Back.""

“The reason I'm losing the weight is to prove how simple it is to lose weight if you really want to, and the only way I can do that is by becoming fat myself,” Hopkins says on the TLC special.

“I really believe that fat people’s solution is in their hands,” she says. “They don’t need to put so much into their face.”

Hopkins, a mother of three, gained the weight by eating over 6,000 calories per day, despite a doctor telling her on the show that her weight fluctuation “is not a good idea.”

During the show's filming, Hopkins also traveled to the U.S. to meet people fighting obesity who struggle to see eye-to-eye with her opinions on weight.

“I look at you and I think, ‘You are a wreck of a human being,’” Hopkins tells one overweight woman, who is later seen on camera calling on her cellphone to report a hate crime.

American author, TV personality and transformation pro Chris Powell says that Hopkins’ weight experiment discounts too much.

“She’s focusing so much on the physical aspect of weight loss and she’s totally ignored the psychological and emotional component of it,” Powell, the host of ABC’s “Extreme Weight Loss,” told ABC News.

Courtesy TLC

Hopkins’ journey to gain and lose the weight took six months and was something that even Hopkins concedes was not as easy as she had hoped.

“It actually turned out to be a real ordeal,” she says on the show. “I understand that when you are fat, you don’t want to put your trainers on and go running out the door because you think people will laugh at you.”

“I know how hard it is to be fat and carry that weight around and I know no one wants to be fat by choice,” she says. “It’s about the amount you put in and how you burnt it off.”

“I don’t think it has to be quite as intimidating.”

There is no set timeline for how long the investigation will take, but the law enforcement official said ""it will take months.""

The federal investigation was launched after a Staten Island grand jury decided not to indict Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo on any criminal charges stemming from Garner's death on July 17.

The Staten Island district attorney's office has already begun handing over evidence to the FBI.

Federal investigators are limited in what information they can get from the NYPD, which has its own internal investigation. They can obtain limited information for limited purposes, but have to be specific in how they apply the information because police officers are required to cooperate with Internal Affairs and can't use Fifth Amendment protections to avoid self-incrimination.

The federal investigation and the NYPD internal investigation will run concurrently. When asked how long he estimated the the investigation could take, former Commissioner Ray Kelly told ABC News that he would expect the internal trial to take about six months.

The number of members of the FBI squad dedicated to the case remains unclear, but it is expected to be few agents conducting an intensive investigation.

The focus of the investigation will rest squarely on the police officers and whether their conduct amounted to a ""hate crime"" as it is very narrowly defined in federal law.

Investigators will also focus on whether the cops were guilty of using excessive force, which is perceived to be much easier to prove in general and is expected to be an easier case to argue given the cell phone video of the July 17 altercation.

Police officers are the only ones who are formal subjects of the investigation, but the Justice Department could also decide to investigate the conduct of the emergency medical technicians for possible inaction or providing substandard care, though those hypothetical charges would be civil and not criminal.",abcnews.com,True

Even more true to its founding ideals. I want to thank the dedicated public servants who form the backbone of the United States Department of Justice for their tireless work over the past six years. The efforts they will continue. And for the progress had been made and that will -- outlast us all. Analysts think -- four act joining me on a journey that now moves in another direction. But that will always be guided by the pursuit of justice. And -- The northstar. Bank. And you've been. Was named to. Attorney general Eric Holder -- his resignation in a very emotional sort of speech as well. As President Obama they're introducing him let's go back to Jonathan Karl at the White House Jonathan this has been in the works evidently for some time what did you make. Of this announcement that we just heard. Well you can clearly see the bond between the two -- as as we -- going into this. This was among the very first cabinet nominations the president made then senator president elect Obama made in 2008 after winning the election. The two are very close in fact just when the president at his vacation -- on Martha's Vineyard they spent time together I'm sure this was discussed then his departure now. Is is not a surprise anyway holder had signaled 22 friends for some time that he intended to go. By the end of the year it's very significant that he is saying that he will stay on and tell his successor is nominated and confirmed. The reason why that's important is the holder has been an extremely controversial attorney general on the -- from the Republicans they really. Just -- -- if there's one member of the Obama cabinet that they would like to see -- it is Eric Holder they have clashed with him on a whole number of of issues. And now he is saying that he will stay as attorney general NTELOS successor is name what that does. Is it makes it harder for Republicans to block whoever Obama's successor is because by blocking the successor. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Course as you mentioned the lightning rod on many issues just listening to. The president outlined the portfolio. That Eric Holder had an all the offices studies oversaw from civil rights to. Certainly. The immigration issues what will be his ten year. As attorney general what sort of legacy doesn't leave behind of course is the first African American attorney general of the US. But he still investigating in the high profile shooting of Michael brown and Ferguson Missouri. Well above all. The legacy for holdover from his advocates will be on the issue of equal justice you know Eric -- he mentioned -- -- Bobby Kennedy. That was his model to be -- attorney general -- Bobby Kennedy to be in the forefront of equal justice under the law. And in this it has been exactly. Where he concludes -- this year you know I would say that probably the high point of holders. A ten years attorney general came just this summer -- what happened in Ferguson Missouri -- the president tasked holder. -- dealing with being the main person -- administration to deal with that issue he went to Ferguson. After the shooting of Michael Brown he met with -- all of the key players on that. Any -- at a moment of incredibly high tension. -- promise -- that there would be justice in this case. And -- you must be said to defused it's significantly that a significant role in defusing the tensions in Ferguson that was something that. The -- I'm sure -- be seen is as part of -- it was certainly a highlight of his tenure also on the issue of by the counterterrorism. -- of one of the more controversial things that holder did very early on is he announced his intention to prosecute Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the mastermind behind the 9/11. Attack in New York you want to bring him from Guantanamo Bay. Two New York. To be tried. In the city that of course was the center of the 9/11 attacks this was a very controversial move there wasn't a lot of ground work that was laid. Before making that announcement even democratic. Political leaders in New York. -- work we're blind sided by this didn't like the way this was handled and of course it never happened congress blocked any movement of -- -- Out of Guantanamo to New York tips for that prosecution. And you mentioned those detractors and of course the focus of controversy from the fast and the furious to obtaining phone records of journalists. Hold it was the first attorney general to be held in contempt by congress. We know that lawmakers -- his departure so who are -- early candidates to be the new attorney general. Well two that are very close to President Obama I think will be very high on this list one is Kathy wrong war. She until very recently was the white house council effectively the president's lawyer. I we have been told she will be under strong consideration for this another what is Donald -- he is the current solicitor general. For the United States that is the person that argues before the Supreme Court. On behalf of the administration. Pirelli was the person that argued the health care case before the Supreme Court -- -- the constitutionality. Of obamacare. He was. Criticized by some advocates of obamacare for doing it ineffective job in the in making that argument but he ended up winning the case 54 decision winning upholding. The constitutionality of the president saying that. Signature legislative achievement. I think that he will be very high on that list Deval Patrick the governor of Massachusetts is often been mentioned. But reporters caught up with him today he said. It's a very important job but it -- not one for me right now so that you can probably take his name off that list and we'll hear others. But I expect Kathy roller and -- over only to be. On the top of that shortlist. And also with mid term elections it also looks like Republicans could control the senate next year do you think the president. Will try to push this candidate through before that happens what timeline DC. Well that's a very good question. It's virtually impossible to do it before the election congress'. Left left town they're on recess or district work period as they call it out campaigning. So that would almost certainly not happen. The question is what they try to do it during a lame duck session after the election of Democrats lost control of the senate would they try to. Push it through before the new center this morning in January I think that's highly unlikely but it's not impossible they could try to -- that also. Very critical thing is the Democrats push through of course you remember the rule change in the senate. It -- that it made it possible to confirm nominees with a simple majority. 51 votes all that's needed now of course that the precedent long before that had been sixty votes needed. If anybody were to filibuster a nomination so they've got they they could easily go through and confirm somebody with just democratic votes. But there would be such a controversy.

Lansdale Hospital-Abington Health told ABC News,“Effective today, September 25, 2014, Kathryn Knott has been terminated from her employment at Abington Health.”

Knott, 24, had initially been suspended her because of charges stemming from her alleged involvement in an attack on two gay men in downtown Philadelphia.

""We are investigating an additional issue that was brought to our attention related to this employee’s Twitter account for potential violations of patient privacy and our organization’s social media policy,"" the hospital said in a statement. ""Abington Health takes patient privacy and confidentiality very seriously and is fully investigating this matter.""

Philadelphia Police Department/AP Photo

Knott, from Southampton, Pennsylvania, had worked at the hospital since 2011 as an emergency room tech. Her Twitter page includes tweets about apparent patients and photos of X-rays.

She was arrested this week with two men, Kevin Harrigan, 26, and Phillip Williams, 24, for her alleged role in the Sept. 11 fight. Her lawyer has said she is innocent, but her tweets going back to 2012 are going viral for what she had to say about foreign cab drivers, gay men and Asian people, among others.

People blasted Knott on social media as ""spoiled,"" ""racist,"" and ""a homophobic piece of garbage.""

Knott is the daughter of Chalfont Borough Police Chief Karl Knott, and other messages she wrote suggest she's received special attention because of her father's job.

Neither the Chalfont Borough Police department or Karl Knott have returned ABC News' request for comment.

Knott's attorney, Louis Busico, did not respond to ABC News' request for comment about the tweets, but maintained his client's innocence in an earlier statement.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/daughter-suburban-philadelphia-police-chief-trio-charged-gay/story?id=25745914,"The daughter of suburban Philadelphia police chief is among three people charged with attacking a gay couple two weeks ago, a case that prompted amateur sleuths to use social media to help identify the suspects.

The trio -- Kathryn Knott, 24, of Southampton, Pennsylvania, who is the daughter of Chalfont Borough Police Chief Karl Knott; Kevin Harrigan, 26, of Southampton; and Phillip Williams, 24, of Warminster, Pennsylvania, -- surrendered to police in Philadelphia on Wednesday.

The three held down the two men and beat them while making disparaging comments about their sexual orientation and stealing one victim's bag, police said. Both victims were hospitalized, one beaten so badly he had his jaw wired shut and required facial surgery. Police haven't released the names of the victims.

""They're still reliving it all,"" said a friend of the victims, Caryn Kunkle. ""It's really -- it's tough.""

After police released surveillance video, amateur sleuths from across the country shared photos and information as they tried identifying the suspects.

""This vicious attack shocked the entire country. An assault on people because of their sexual orientation has no place in Philadelphia,"" District Attorney Seth Williams said in a statement.

The three are charged with aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy, simple assault and recklessly endangering another person.

Attorneys for Knott and Williams denied that the victims' sexual orientation played a role in the incident.

""In no way, shape or form was this incident related to anyone's sexual orientation,"" Williams' attorney, Fortunato Perri Jr., told the Associated Press on Wednesday. ""This was a mutual confrontation that started because two individuals got into an argument out in the street.""

""She would not hurt anybody, period, regardless of their orientation, their color, their background,"" said Knott's attorney, Louis Busico.

Busico also denied that Knott insulted them or threw any punches.

""I represent a young woman who's never been in trouble,"" he said. ""She's from a wonderful family. She has a law enforcement background within her family. She played no role in this.""

Pennsylvania's hate-crimes law does not cover crimes motivated by a person's sexual orientation, according to the AP.

Following her arrest, Knott's Twitter account has drawn her more attention, because she's claimed there to have taken advantage of her father's position in the past.

Thanks to social media, police said they now know who they're looking for in connection with an alleged attack late Sept. 11 in downtown Philadelphia.

A group of ""well-dressed"" and ""clean-cut"" white men and women held down two men and beat them, making disparaging comments about their sexual orientation and stealing one victim's bag, police said. Both victims landed in the hospital, one beaten so badly he had his jaw wired shut and required facial surgery.

Tuesday night, Twitter users determined to identify the suspects shared surveillance video police had released and asked for help.

Another Twitter user named @GreggyBennet joined in the search, sharing a photo allegedly showing the same suspects at a restaurant earlier that night. He said a ""friend of a friend of a friend"" saw the video and sent him the photo.

Even more Twitter users retweeted that photo and worked together to identify the restaurant in the background.

I'm finally who I'm supposed to be. Do you understand? I can't go back. ""Orange is the new black."" One of its breakout stars, Laverne cox. A woman born biologically male became the first transgendered Emmy acting nominee. There she was on the red carpet just last night. She didn't win, but she's using her fame to shine a spot light on transgender issues. Here's ABC's chief national correspondent Byron Pitts. You've got the wrong girl. Reporter: She's one of the stars of netflix's show, ""Orange is the new black."" Actress Laverne cox. A transgender woman in real life playing a transgender inmate in a female prison. So many people say they see themselves reflected in this character. Reporter: Her role is one of a number reflective of the transgender community now coming of age in mainstream America. On Broadway, Neil Patrick Harris winning a Tony for his performance in ""Headwig and the angry inch."" Online, Facebook users now able to choose between 56 different options for gender identity. And in fashion, Barney's department store featuring an ad campaign with transgender models. All a far cry from cox's childhood as a young boy in Alabama. I was bullied. I internalized a lot of shame. About who I was as a child. Reporter: Bullied because? Because of my gender expression. Because I didn't act the way someone assigned male at birth was supposed to act. There's a cultural environment where trans people are told who we are is a mistake. We should try to be someone else. Reporter: It's estimated there are nearly 1 million transgendered men and women in America. Many of them teenagers, like Michael and Isaac. I wasn't a girl except physically. I don't have to live a lie anymore. I suffered for so many years because people said it was just a phase and that I would grow out of it. When I look in the mirror now, I see myself. Reporter: High school classmates, Isaac and Michael were born girls. They came out to the world as transgendered in a youtube video. I've been living more like a guy since elementary school. It used to be thought 1 in 40,000 people had gender dysphoria. Now surveys are suggesting it may be as high as 1 in 250. Reporter: Gender dysphoa. Now a medical diagnosis for those feeling a disconnect between their assigned and perceived gender. Despite growing research, there is pushback. California's controversial law ab-1226, allows transjendered children to use facilities and participate in activities based on their gender. We want to protect all children. Especially the 99% having their privacy invaded by this intrusive law. Reporter: According to the latest polling, 89% of Americans agree, transgendered people deserve the same legal rights and protection. Even defense secretary chuck Hagel waded into these ever-shifting waters. Every qualified American who wants to serve our country should have an opportunity. Reporter: As for Laverne cox, her success on television has given a voice to many who once felt voiceless. Having your story told validates you're experience. It's like, I'm not alone anymore. Maybe I'll be okay. Reporter: For ""This week,"" Byron Pitts. ABC, Kansas City. Here now, Mara Kiesling and Sabrina ruben-erderly, who has covered this issue extensively. Thanks to both of you for being here. Mara, you have been active on this issue for at least a dozen years. Now, you say we've come to the point ""Time"" magazine says we're at a tipping point. You have had progress in courts. Laverne cox coming in and being nominated for an Emmy award. What is your sense? Have we reached a critical moment here now for this movement? I think absolutely. And we're winning policy change. Faster than we ever thought we could. The culture is changing really, really fast. But still, the truth is, while that's happening and while that's all great and important, there are a million tragedies happening every day with people having judges take away their kids because they're trans. People being disrespected out on the street. People being murdered. We had one of the worst months of transgender murders this past June. All this summer has been a bad month for violence. That stuff is still going on. Maybe that's partly because there are so many more of us out there educating and living our lives. And Sabrina, you have written a lot about the challenges. This is still a very marginalized community. Absolutely. This new acceptance of trans people is certainly something to get very excited about. But bear in mind, it flies in the face of the most basic day-to-day reality of most trans people. They face a shocking amount of violence. Trans people make up maybe 10% of the lgbt community. But they make up a shockingly huge disproportionate number of the hate crime statistics. How are institutions handling this? I ask you as a Vassar college graduate. How are women's colleges? Are they accepting transgendered females? On the collegiate level, there's been a huge acceptance of transgender women. There's been a lot of accommodation for, um, bathrooms and, uh, dorm rooms. Um, but I think that, um, one place where there's been a good deal of progress has been, it's been interesting to see how it's been playing out in terms of transgender. The parents of gender nonconforming kids. Now that there's a new awareness of the kinds of harms that come to transgender people, that they're more likely to be homeless. That they're more likely and there's a cascade of harm that can come to them once they're hopeless. They're more likely to be at risk for drug addiction. Suicide. That, parents are now -- being much more supportive of their kids' decisions to live as their preferred gender.

http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aol-tech-guru-steve-johnson-seeks-justice-gay/story?id=23992749,"Boston Internet pioneer Steve Johnson said he was convinced early on that his younger brother's death more than two decades ago was not a suicide, but murder –- the result of a gay-bashing incident in Australia.

In December 1988, Scott Johnson was celebrating the completion of his doctorate in mathematics and had everything to live for. But just days later, his naked body was found mangled on the rocks at the bottom of 164-foot-tall cliffs near Manly, just north of Sydney -- a hang-out or ""beat"" for gays.

Gay college student Matthew Shepard brutally murdered in 1998.

Courtesy Steve Johnson

The 27-year-old's clothes were found neatly folded at the top of the cliffs, and his wallet was missing. After 36 hours, New South Wales police assumed the death was a suicide as there was no evidence of foul play.

""Scott and I were as close as two brothers could be,"" Johnson, now 55 and co-founder and CEO of the advertising company Choicestream, told ABC News. ""He was a brilliant, idealistic young man. The day he died, he had just finished the final proof for his math Ph.D. He had just gotten off the phone with his professor who had congratulated him.""

Family and friends were baffled because Scott had shown no signs of negativity or depression. Johnson was haunted by the death, not knowing if he had slipped or been pushed.

Students charged with hate crimes against roommates.

As early as 1989, the family asked for an inquest to reexamine the death and Johnson made multiple trips to Australia to meet with police over the decades. But he says they faced a “Catch 22”: Without a reversal of the coroner’s report, police could not reinvestigate; and without evidence for murder, the coroner could not take that action.

At the time of his brother's death, Johnson was a graduate student with no money. But by 1998, he had made a fortune while at America Online, leading the development of AOL 4.0, You've Got Pictures and its acquisition of Netscape.

His 25-year quest to find his brother's killer is the subject of a documentary, ""Australian Story: On the Precipice,"" which aired in 2013 on Australian Broadcasting Corporation's flagship show.

The film will be shown throughout June here in the United States on the World Channel, associated with PBS, as part of series of programs for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride month.

Wisconsin shootings show Sikhs are victims of hate crimes.

The 30-minute documentary resulted last year in the New South Wales Police re-opening the cold case and offering a $100,000 reward for “information on how [he] died.”

On a NSW police webpage devoted exclusively to the case, Detective Acting Superintendent Chris Olen says, ""At this stage, it is not known whether Scott's death is a result of suicide, misadventure or murder. …With a lack of witnesses and physical evidence, this is a very challenging case. What we need is fresh information to help us solve this case and bring some closure to the Johnson family.""

The case echoes the 1998 murder of 21-year-old Matthew Shepard, who was abducted by two men and tied to a split rail fence in Wyoming, where he was assaulted with the butt of a pistol and left to die. But in Shepherd's case, within a week police were able to make arrests.

His death sparked the eventual passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a federal law that targets hate crimes directed at lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people as well as by race, national origin and other factors.

""It's obvious Steve cared and loved his brother very much,"" Matthew's mother, Judy Shephard, 61, told ABC News. ""I admire his tenacity greatly and I know what it takes to continue to do that when the odds are against you -– it was far worse than mine. I can't imagine what he had to go through all these years, wondering, and now to find out.""

Scott Johnson's death is still a mystery, but his brother is convinced it was a hate crime.

A 2013 report in the Sydney Herald, says that it is believed as many as 80 men may have disappeared or been found dead possibly linked to so-called ""poofter bashing"" between the late 1970s and late 1990s, of which 30 remain unsolved. Packs of youths would ambush gay men and assault them, the story said, and they would ""cliff jump"" and push men over the edge.

As late as 2002, the director of the Australian Institute of Criminology said “poofter bashing” in Australia was often committed ""as sport,” according to the online newspaper, The Age. “Apparently this sport is not only alive and well, but young men who excel at it can expect to be treated leniently by our courts.”

Today the term is used widely in the political debate over gay rights.

Scott Johnson left Sydney for the beach on a Thursday and his body was found on that following Saturday. ""I know what Scott did,"" said his brother. ""He put his pencil down and went to celebrate.""

""He was a sweet, gentle person,"" said Johnson, still choking up 26 years later. ""The atmosphere in these places was very friendly and open. To see someone up there who you expect to be friendly and suddenly be jumped –- I can't even imagine.""

Steve Johnson first learned his brother was gay in high school. ""Scott had a lot of trouble telling me who he was in love with ... I even thought that he was having trouble because he got a girlfriend pregnant.""

""When he said it was not a girl, I was shocked,"" said Johnson. After graduating top of his class at CalTech and studying at Cambridge University and Harvard, his brother eventually fell in love and moved to Australia to study.

Johnson's quest for the truth began in 2005 when he said his ""world was turned upside down.""

An inquest in Sydney, ""Operation Taradale"" looked at three other unsolved deaths around the same time as Scott's death at nearby Bondi Beach, where bodies had ended up at the bottom of the cliffs. They, too, had been ruled suicides.

""One man had someone else's hair clenched in his fist,"" said Johnson. ""It was pretty clear that happened to Scott.""

Johnson flew to Australia after hearing about those news reports from his brother's partner, but he said police ""completely ignored me.""

In 2007, after several other futile visits, Johnson enlisted the help of Dan Glick, then at Newsweek, who had made his mark reporting the 1996 death of child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey.

""If Steve wasn't wealthy, this would not have gotten investigated and that is a sad testimony,"" Glick told ABC News. ""That's why I respect him so much.""

Glick, co-founder of Colorado-based The Story Group, said he used his journalism skills as a private investigator, ""asking good questions, having a really good bulls*** meter, not believing everything we are told and seeking documentation.""

In the film, Glick tells Johnson, ""I think Scott was killed. I will investigate it as if my own brother had been killed.""

Johnson spared no expense in funding Glick's investigation and the pair became close friends. They created a Facebook page ""Justice for Scott Johnson,"" hoping to find leads.

As a result of Glick's investigation, the coroner overturned the suicide verdict in Scott's death in 2012. At the time, Johnson was besieged by reporters and agreed to tell his story to the press. ""It was on the 6 o'clock news that night and 15 or 20 articles appeared over the next week,"" he said.

But Johnson said police continued to ""stonewall"" him, maintaining the northern beach where Scott had died was not a gay hangout –- until the documentary aired.

The day after the film was broadcast, Johnson and his sister held a news conference with police to announce Scott's case would be reopened. Seven families who saw the show came forward to say they also had lost sons –- at least five at the beach.

Scott's partner, an academic, declined to be part of the documentary for privacy reasons. He now lives in the United States, according to Johnson.

Johnson admits the seven-year investigation could never have been accomplished without his financial backing, but other families still want answers.

He is pushing for broader investigations into other cases.

""These crimes are still solvable,"" he said. ""These youth gangs are still in their 40s and probably live in the same cities. One thing about gang violence –- they like to brag. We've heard dozens of stories from former gang members or their girlfriends.""

Records kept by the Lesbian and Gay Society Melbourne show that about two dozen men were convicted in the gay-bashing cases in the Bondi area and sentenced to prison terms from the late 1980s to 2009. The rest of the cases are still open.

Times have changed in Australia in regard to hate crimes directed against LGBT people, according to a recent report by the Australian Broadcasting Corp. “I would say that in Australia, in practice, we have achieved a remarkable degree of recognition and equality for same-sex partnerships,” author Dennis Altman told the network.

“Cops in general are much more aware and much better trained and much less homophobic,” said Glick. “But I talked to one cop who was openly gay in 1988, and he said it was not easy then.”

And gays can openly serve in military now.

The Tea Party's mama grizzly is roaring again, backing a candidate who has a way, not with grizzlies, but gators.

Sarah Palin announced another endorsement today - this time in the Louisiana Senate race, throwing her support behind the non-establishment Republican candidate Rob Maness.

""In the Louisiana Senate race we have the opportunity to send a true conservative and a real warrior to join that fight. So, today I am lending my support to retired Col. Rob Maness for U.S. Senate,"" Palin was quoted as saying in a statement sent out by Maness' campaign.

Palin's announcement comes on the same day that Maness rolled out his first television and radio ads of the campaign cycle - a combined $50,000 buy. The television ad, titled "" Gator,"" compares the skills needed to be an effective senator to alligator wrangling.

Maness even straddles an alligator in the ad and says, ""I approve this message because Louisiana needs a senator who will stand up to the career politicians… and the alligators.""

Asked if alligator wrestling is a choice of sport or just a metaphor for his ad, Maness jokingly said: ""Look, all I'm going to say is that no alligators were harmed in the making of this commercial but … a few career politicians might have been.""

""An alligator appears to be a dangerous animal that lies in wait to devour whatever it can, because it's always hungry, and in that way, the gators are not unlike liberal politicians,"" he added. ""They're willing to destroy every last vestige of our liberties and our independence.""

Maness, a retired Air Force colonel, has never held elected to office before and is attempting to break through in a race currently defined by incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu. She is fighting to keep her seat against Rep. Bill Cassidy, the Republican contender mostly closely trailing her in the polls.

""Rob is the admitted underdog in this race,"" Palin said in the statement. ""Having spent his career in uniform, he does not have deep pockets or lobbyist connections to fund his campaign. To me, it's a blessing, not a curse that he's not held office before. After all, our founders weren't politicians - many of them in fact were military leaders. Maybe it's time we got back to those roots!""

Palin also took a direct jab at Cassidy attacking him as a former Reagan opponent and the establishment choice.

""The GOP establishment has turned to a moderate Congressman who opposed President Reagan in the past and was actually a supporter of Mary Landrieu until recent years,"" Palin said. ""He voted to raise the debt ceiling, was one of 19 Republicans to vote for President Obama's hate crimes legislation, campaigned in support of the government bailout (but now opposes it), voted for Obamacare Medicare savings (but now opposes them). Come on, GOP, is this the best we can do? I say no.""

Maness said that he is ""humbled"" by Palin's endorsement, which he said he sought because of her record of public service.

""I am truly humbled Governor Palin would lend her credibility to a regular guy like me,"" Maness said in a statement. ""We are winning this campaign the old-fashioned way - by putting people over politics. I've logged 50,000 miles in my Ford F-150 and visited all 64 of Louisiana's great parishes - this endorsement is just the energy we need to keep trucking!""

This is one in a string of endorsements from Palin, who has also recently thrown her support behind several other Tea Party candidates in Nebraska, Georgia, Minnesota and Oklahoma. In her endorsement, Palin noted Maness' stance against ""amnesty"" for undocumented immigrants and the Affordable Care Act, as well as his support of gun rights, as factors that make him a ""true conservative.""",abcnews.com,True

This is what its happening. This is coming your way. On one side, british born radical muslims. We don't follow presidents or prime ministers. Reporter: Who believe they're fighting a holy war against the west. And want the law to rule. There is no such thing. On the other, the far right movement Robinson founded. He is our one leader. The one and only leader. English defensemen says their mission is to fight radical Islam. What can we do? It is too late. It is never, ever, too late! Reporter: But the edl became synonymous with racism and islamaphobia. Its members connected to hate crimes and mosque bombings. It was tempting to brush the edl aside as racist thugs set fear. But so many ordinary citizens were responding to their message. I had to find out why not only as the a journalist, but as a Muslim woman myself. I have spent maybe all of my life here in London. Four years I have reported from both the middle east. And here at home. This is a very happy moment for both William and Kate. But as I was about to find out, this is the assignment where those world collide. , stab your mum. All death threats people have tweeted you. My journey began in north west London.

Reporter: Heap does admit there are racists in his group who do. Put it in perspective. 2,000 minimum islamist, terrorists in this country that wish to inflict murder and war on the country. Now my biggest fear is in 20 or 30 years that will be 20,000. A small army. I have a duty as a father and duty as englishman to do anything we can to prevent that. What was the tipping point for you? This is an attack that is genuinely shocked the world. A british soldier attacked and beheaded on the streets of London. The soldier who was stabbed to death. By two knife-wielding Muslim converts. Two killers describe themselves as soldiers of Allah. Reporter: This horrific attack took place. As I reported on this hideous crime. All I could think was not again ate to home grown radicals using my religion as an excuse for unspeakable acts. The blow back was immediate. At the center of it. Tommy Robinson and the edl whose membership skyrocketed. Political Islam. Political Islam spreading across this country. Reporter: As much as I disagree with tactics of the edl I understand tommy Robinson's anger. Because like most muslims I condemn any violence committed in the name of Allah. Yes to shariah. There are extremists among us. I track them down at a rally in east London. We don't shake hands, men and women. Reporter: This is the founder of a radical Muslim group that was banned under Britain's terrorist act. In this video you can see one of lee Rigby's killers over his shoulder. Do you condone killing lee Rigby. You have to look at the wider picture. Look at lee Rigby. If you don't have a minute of silence. You would never speak. Where is your silence for the muslims.

The suspect in court for the first time on Tuesday. Formally charged with killing three in a hate crime at two jewish centers over the weekend. Potentially facing the death penalty if convicted. ABC's Steve osunsami joins us from Overland Park, Kansas, with the latest. Good morning, Steve. Reporter: Good morning, robin. The accused gunman had no friends or family in the courtroom, outside of reporters and lawyers. The only other witnesses were two women from the jewish community center who came to see justice at work. Wearing a jailed-issued suicide prevention gown and looking disoriented, 73-year-old Frazier Glenn cross made his first court appearance, telling the judge he needed a court-appointed lawyer. I don't have no money. Reporter: The judge set his bond at $10 million and assigned him a lawyer from Topeka. He did not enter a plea. State prosecutors charged him with first-degree murder for the shooting death of terry lamanno. And capital murder for the killing of rat Underwood and his grandfather, Ka William Corporan in the parking lot of the jewish community center. It has the most serious penalty, which is the potential of the death penalty. Reporter: The D.A. Says more charges could come later. We are continuing this investigation. And there's a good possibility that additional charges could be forthcoming. Reporter: Federal prosecutors may pursue their own case, as well, as they believe this former grand dragon of the Ku klux Klan intended to kill Jews, even though all of the victims happened to be Christians.

Prosecutors say they haven't decided yet if they'll seek the death penalty but it is an option. They said they need more time to look at all the evidence because this is not a decision they'll take lightly. Karen Travers ABC news Washington. And I want to bring an ABC news correspondent legal analyst and attorney Brian Smith Ryan thanks for joining us. Cross had an odd appearance in court today he was draped in what was described by sheriff's department spokesperson as a suicide prevention smock. Do we know why and -- a standard. Well not necessarily standard a lot of times it'll depend on if the person coming in has mental issues. And that's -- is on him so that it can't be be constructed so that it can't be disassembled. And used in some form -- fashion. But tons of prisoners come in or -- up people come in and they have some sort of argument or so some sort of erratic behavior they'll take away certain items of clothing but -- a case like this looks like. There might be some instability so they do need to have that smock on. Now -- a short court appearance today cross asked for a court appointed attorney. Standard procedure what else happened and what happens next in this case. Well the other thing is you talk about -- the establishment of bail so bail was set at a very very high level I believe in the neighborhood of the millions of dollars so in the case like that. Not surprising at all since the conditions of bail -- -- only be released if for example he wasn't a detriment to the community. Or possibly wasn't a flight risk. So it looks like he'll be spending a lot of time in prison what happens next is. The determination on charges especially things like the death penalty we'll have to be part of the consideration. Strict bed downforce of course we heard from the state they said that they are treating this as a capital. Crime here but federal charges and -- could also apply in terms of a hate crime. That's right so you've got two different paths to a possible death penalty situation on the state level and on the federal level. On the federal level it's because of the hate crime if that is in fact charges that are brought against him so. They have to make that determination on the state level it's the same sort of thing but it's based on the murder charges so he's facing three murder charges. And the death penalty is when you have murder plus what they call aggravating circumstances the crime was heinous toasts and cool. Other people might have been killed because of his action. So I would say on both levels is a pretty good chance that he may be facing the death and and since these are on two different -- what case might take precedent. A lot of times the state case will go first we won't know that for sure especially in terms of when they decide to bring death penalty charges if they in fact -- in either of those jurisdictions. And -- the three victims who were shot ended up not being Jewish. Which authorities are saying that was his motive. Could all of this be also caused some sort of an effect in what sort of impact could this have on the case moving forward. It's the existing think is typically doesn't the fact that they are not Jewish. Doesn't mean that it could be considered a hate crime because. Under a lot of hate crime laws what matters is what's in the state of mind of the person committing the act so -- he had the belief. That he was doing something out of -- out of bias. Then in fact he can be convicted under the hate crime statutes so the fact that they were -- probably will not have an effect in this case. And certainly as a state moves forward with their charges they'll be proving the murder charges that the federal government decides to move forward to pay charges -- they have. A higher threshold to prove these sort of police. In some instances yes there's a couple of different standards they must meet -- -- long and -- of it is. It got to prove that his actions were motivated by that bias or by that eight. And so they'll have to compile a lot of evidence a lot of times you look at a case like this. And you say well it seems very simple he's the man who did the shooting and people are dead therefore can -- not move forward but. A -- -- a long investigations they have to gather information evidence. Because they want to make sure they have an airtight case against the man they believe committed these crimes. It's and they certainly have not decided yet whether -- seeking the death penalty how long what prosecutors had to decide that they have a little bit of time and it depends it goes from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. But at the -- there is not as if they have to decide today or tomorrow. So they will take their time and make sure they have all their ducks in a row before they decide to charge the death penalty and how much might crosses history has background. His affiliation with so called hate groups and play and -- In the case like this that would play a major role at trial because. The idea is he had -- bias in his mind how do we prove that. We look at his past actions in addition to his present actions and we look at some of the things he's been saying in some of the videos that are out there. That apparently he posted so a lot of that is going to come into play. And his pass will put a very prominent role -- whatever trial happens here.

""I think Glenn had gone insane, completely insane in recent years,” Don Black, a former Ku Klux Klan member and the founder of Stormfront, the “White Pride World Wide” website, told ABCNews.com. ""Probably because of the alcohol. But whatever it was, he did us a lot of damage this weekend.

""He killed Christians. The whole thing was completely insane. His brain has rotted,” Black added.

Accused Kansas Shooter In Wheelchair For Court Appearance

Family, Friends Remember Victims of Kansas Shooting Spree

Frazier Glenn Miller, a former KKK leader, allegedly killed three people Sunday when he opened fire at two Jewish community centers in Kansas. The charging documents used the last name of Miller, but he was addressed as ""Mr. Cross"" by the judge at a hearing today. He set his bond at $10 million. Cross is an alias used by the suspect.

Miller was charged earlier today with one count of capital murder and a second count of premeditated first degree murder. The capital murder charge makes him eligible for the death penalty.

Miller's lawyer did not return a call for comment.

Despite his reported allegiance to another anti-Semitic website, Vanguard News Network, Miller had been shunned by the white nationalism community for years, Black said.

He and Miller had a falling-out after Miller testified against fellow KKK members as part of a plea bargain in 1988, Black said.

""It doesn’t matter what side you’re on, people don’t like rats,” Black said. ""He’d been a government informant testifying against personal friends of mine. He came back years later and expected to be accepted back in our circles.”

But there were other reasons Black — who said he never allowed Miller to post on his website’s forum — said the accused killer wasn’t welcome.

“He had a history of too much alcohol, being a blowhard generally,” Black said.

Black, 60, said he was shocked to learn Miller is the suspect in the shootings.

“I would not have anticipated his doing that,” he said. ""I thought he was most mostly talk.”

Commenters on Vanguard News Network, where Miller reportedly posted under the username “Rounder,” were equally surprised.

""This is really out of character, the randomness of it,” a user named “313Chris” wrote. “Just doesn’t read like something he would do.”

Others rallied to support Miller, whose is accused of killing a 14-year-old boy and two adults in the shooting.

“Glenn Miller has more guts and courage in his little finger than these keyboard warriors have in their entire body,” a user named “SA Mann” wrote.

Sinister comments proved some of Miller’s peers approved of the bloodshed.

“He needed to go on a more crowded day,” senior member “Dan Hadaway” wrote. “It didn’t sound like it was too well thought out.”

The Southern Poverty Law Center, a watchdog for hate crimes, calls Black’s Stormfront “the first major hate site on the Internet.”

The group has urged authorities to read forums on sites like Stormfront and Vanguard News Network.

“It’s not like we don’t know where this type of hatred and violence is bred,” said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center in an interview with ABC News. “These forums have to be watched very carefully within whatever the legal bounds are. This is where these people live. This is where our domestic terrorism is coming from.”",abcnews.com,True

The 73-year-old was brought to a closed circuit booth in a wheelchair where he then stood and made his initial court appearance.

A spokesman for the Johnson County jail said the knee-length black garment worn by Miller was a ""suicide prevention smock.""

Jewish Center Shooting Is Latest in Hate Group Surge, Watchdog Says

Family, Friends Remember Victims of the Kansas Shooting Spree

The charging documents used the last name of Miller, but he was addressed as ""Mr. Cross"" by the judge, who set his bond at $10 million. Cross is an alias of the suspect.

He was charged earlier today with one count of capital murder and a second count of premeditated first degree murder. The capital murder charge makes him eligible for the death penalty.

The suspect has long been on the radar of anti-hate groups, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center. At a news conference on Monday, police officially classified the massacre as a ""hate crime.""

Prosecutors said the capital murder charge is for the deaths of William Lewis Corporon and his grandson, Reat Underwood, 14, who were gunned down outside the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City, where parents and their children were gathering for a singing contest.

The premeditated first degree murder charge is for the shooting of Terri LaManno, 53, who was shot and killed minutes later outside the Village Shalom assisted living center where she was visiting her mother.

""The fact that we filed these two counts [doesn’t] mean we can’t add new charges,"" Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe said.""[There is a] good possibility additional charges will be forthcoming.""

U.S. attorney Barry Grissom said federal charges will likely be filed next week.

Miller, who was one of the country's most prominent white supremacists in the 1980s according to two watchdog groups, was armed with at least one shotgun when he allegedly began shooting at people gathered in a parking lot.

Witnesses said the suspect, who is reported to be a former Grand Dragon of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan yelled a Nazi salute after the shooting.

Miller served three years in federal prison on weapons and threatening communications charges, according to court records. As part of a plea bargain, Miller testified against other KKK members at a 1988 sedition trial.

After serving his time, Miller became an unwelcome figure in the white supremacist movement and was viewed as a traitor, Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research at the Anti-Defamation League told ABC News.com.

""Ever since [he took a plea deal], most white supremacists don't want anything to do with him,"" Pitcavage said.

After laying low for a while, Pitcavage said Miller became active again in the past 15 years, taking his hate into the digital age.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/family-friends-remember-victims-kansas-shooting-spree/story?id=23328787,"William Lewis Corporon was taking his grandson to a singing audition at a community center. Terri LaManno was visiting her mother at a nearby retirement complex.

It was a seemingly quiet spring Sunday, but neither Corporon nor his grandson or LaManno made it home alive, their lives cut short by a shooting spree that targeted the two Jewish facilities in the mostly affluent suburb of Kansas City, Kan., known as Overland Park.

Investigators have not revealed any motive for the attack, though suspected gunman Frazier Glenn Cross had a long history of white-supremacist activities and anti-Semitic beliefs. Never mind that Corporon and his grandson were Methodist, and LaManno was Catholic.

WATCH: Witness to Shooting: ‘I Thought I Was Dreaming’

Cross, 73, who also goes by the last name Miller, will face charges today of premeditated murder and federal hate crimes violations.

The shooting victims include Corporon's grandson Reat Underwood, 14, who loved to sing. He was headed for the “KC Superstar” competition, an “American Idol”-like singing contest for high school students. Reat practiced two songs -- “On the Street Where You Live” from “My Fair Lady” and “You Will Miss Me When I’m Gone.”

His mother, Mindy Corporon, drove to the community center to watch her son perform. But when she got there, she spotted her father’s pickup truck, its doors open and her dad motionless. First, she thought he had suffered a heart attack. She soon knew otherwise.

“Very quickly, I realized it wasn’t that, and I knew my dad was in heaven,” she said.

Corporon ran around the vehicle and saw her son on the ground, two strangers attending to him. Before she could get closer, a man approached her, hugged her tightly and led her from the scene.

Reat, 14, had just received his driver’s permit and was already an organ donor, she said.

“He was with us for a wonderful 14 years. He had a really full life for a 14-year-old and we’re very blessed.""

Minutes after the grandfather and grandson’s deaths, LaManno, 53, was gunned down outside the Village Shalom assisted living center. She visited there every Sunday to see her mother.

Her family released a statement, calling her “the best mother, wife, sister and friend that anyone could ask for. She lived for God and the people she loved.”

“He’s been wanting to try out for three years,” Mindy Corporon said at a news conference, a day after her son and father were killed outside a Jewish community center in Overland Park, Kansas. ""He was dressed in a coat and tie and black shirt, and a hat.""

Among the songs her son Reat Underwood, a freshman at Blue Valley High School, was prepared to sing was, “You Will Miss Me When I’m Gone,” she said.

Jewish Center Shooting Classified as a 'Hate Crime'

Suspect ID'd as Former KKK Leader

Suspect Frazier Glenn Cross also allegedly shot and killed the boy’s grandfather, Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, who was taking Reat to the audition.

""I waited for my dad to pick him up and make sure everything was OK, and I had him sing one more time, and I got to kiss him and tell him I loved him,” Corporon said of the last time she saw her son alive.

She showed up to the Jewish Community Campus after a lacrosse game she was attending got canceled because of weather, and immediately saw her dad’s truck in the parking lot, with the doors open.

Both her father and son were dead on the ground.

""I feel confident in what I heard, that they didn’t feel anything, they didn’t know what was coming,” Corporon said. “They were ambushed.""

Less than 24 hours after Cross allegedly opened fire at the community center and a nearby Jewish senior center, killing one other person in his hate-filled rampage, the grief-stricken mom showed signs of strength.

""It was a horrible act of violence and my dad and my son were at the wrong place at the wrong time for a split second,” she said. “We want something good to come out of this, we don’t know what that’s going to be, so we want people to let us know if they think something good has come.”

Corporon, whose family is not Jewish, said her son had signed up to be an organ donor when he recently got his driver’s permit.

""He was with us for a wonderful 14 years, he had a really full life for a 14-year-old and we’re very blessed,” she said.

Her brother Will Corporon also spoke about losing his father and nephew.

""All it takes is an idiot with a gun,” he said of the senseless shootings.

""That idiot completely knocked a family to its knees for no reason. My dad should be seeing patients today at his work. Reat would have been in school today studying and being with his friends. There’s no reason, no reason for this. It’s just a tragedy.”",abcnews.com,True

On this and in this was something that I believe that we -- heard that she was saying if in fact there is to be any good from this she was hoping -- -- to donate some of her son's organs. That's true she says she's. Waiting to hear back from doctors and she's hoping that some way some good can come out of this to make sure that they are honored in their life and death. ABC's Michelle Franzen. Latest on that Michelle thank you I want to bring in now ABC's Ryan -- legal analyst and correspondent they're right we know that the suspect Frazier going -- Who is a very well known white supremacist didn't hide it what else do we know about him. Well we know that he's in his seventies and we know that more than anything he was a man -- -- negativity towards different groups and that's gonna play heavily into. What looks like federal hate crime charges and maybe even state hate crime charges because what really matters for those charges are what was in his mind. Doesn't matter what the victims affiliations were anything like that but what was in his mind so at this point we're still learning more details about him but he had a long history. Anti Semitic comments. And views and had been raised the attention of the FBI in previous cases correct that's right and so they had been keeping an eye on him. But that's the tough thing with a lot of people they're keeping an island. It's hard for them to do different things and -- those people are active so what they do -- they watch they maintain records they try to figure out what these people are doing. But it's it's very very difficult for some groups to say okay well now we know he's going to act we need to move in. So while they were keeping an -- they were doing the best they can to make sure he didn't cause a problem for society obviously. They couldn't know that this was going to happen he was a -- contribute to appear in court today that changed what happened well what happens there is -- they want to get more time. To figure out. What charges they will file whether additional charges will be filed. In kids about 48 hours to determine which one of file and you never want to rush you want to make sure you have all your ducks in a row will there -- gun charges what about the state hate crime charges if any. So in situations like that you know that he'll be charged with first degree murder at least three counts. But the question is are there more charges to come and you don't want to rush in there. Just to make a statement just to make those charges sure you can add them later but you -- -- get as much as you can now given his history that authorities say that the suspect as well known. -- obviously. Against as you pointed out there. Hate against certain particular groups and the government that -- that strengthen its case. It absolutely does and what's key again is what's in his mind that I think there's going to be some argument of well. Not all the people that he went -- were Jewish that doesn't matter if he believes he has a bias. He believes attacking someone based on that biased. That is enough to get that conviction based on a whole litany of other things that happen in hate -- suits -- hate crime charges. So when you look at a federal hate crime charge which is likely to happen here the maximum penalty is the death penalty. On the state level in Kansas for first degree murder with aggregators in this case. Things like heinous atrocious and cruel behavior or putting others in danger. That also carries the death penalty you're looking at two different systems in which he might be eligible for the death penalty if convicted that of course the legal aspect all of this that right now the community still obviously grieving and very shaken up. By the loss of those three people ABC's Ryan Smith with the latest on that -- certainly appreciate the time.

http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/03/bill-clinton-in-1999-every-time-i-mention-gays-my-numbers-go-down/,"On Jan. 11, 1999 - a little more than a week before Bill Clinton was set to deliver the last State of the Union Address of the 20th century - he huddled in Oval Office with a group of advisers and worried.

""Mark always says that every time I mention gays, my numbers go down in the State of the Union,"" Clinton told his team. ""It's the only thing that goes down.""

Clinton's concern stemmed from a draft version of the speech, which included a reference to Judy and Dennis Shepard of Casper, Wyo., the parents of Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was brutally murdered in October 1998. The Clinton White House was not only considering having the president mention Shepard in his address but also inviting the slain student's parents to Washington to sit in the first lady's box during the speech.

Here are the remarks written for Clinton, according to an early draft of the speech:

""With us tonight are Judy and Dennis Shepard of Casper, Wyo. Dennis is an oil rig inspector. Judy [stayed at home and raised two fine sons]. This fall, they were proud when their elder son Matthew enrolled in his Dad's alma mater, the University of Wyoming. But barely a few months into his freshman year; Matthew was beaten, tied to a fence, and left for dead on a deserted country road. He was killed, police say, because he was gay. My fellow Americans, this should never have happened to the Shepards and their son - and it should never happen to any family in America.""

But, according to a transcript of Clinton's actual address, Clinton never said those words (and didn't mention Shepard at all in his remarks). As for the Shepards - they were either not invited to attend the 1999 State of the Union address or chose not to come.

Clinton advisers had their own concerns about the family: ""The Shepards are Republicans - we can't say this, but they're Republicans,"" an adviser said during the pre-speech meeting with the president. ""We don't know if they would be interesting in coming.""

'DeLay Is Probably a Major Suspect'

During the same meeting, as Clinton wrestled with how to deal with Shepard's murder as well as that of an African-American man in Texas, James Byrd Jr., who in 1998 was tortured and killed by white supremacists (one of whom was later executed for the crime), apparently because he was black, comes this stunner from the president - surely a joke.

""I wish I could have that family from Texas - Tom DeLay is probably a major suspect in that case.""

At the time, DeLay was a top House Republican from Texas, where the Byrd lynching took place.

The comments come from a transcript drawn from an audio recording. The transcript was released on Friday, along with thousands of other pages of documents from the Clinton White House, but the audio recording was not.

'Stay Away From the Gay Issue'

A year later, in January 2000 - the beginning of 2000, Clinton's final full year in office - a White House speechwriter got some blunt feedback from a senior administration aide: ""Stay away from the gay issue.""

That was the advice given to speechwriter Samir Afridi by Mary L. Smith, then the associate director of policy planning for the White House Domestic Policy Council, regarding a Jan. 15, 2000 radio address Clinton was set to give commemorating Martin Luther King Day.

""Looks good,"" Smith wrote to Afridi in a late-night e-mail message responding to a draft of the address. ""I wouldn't mention the JCC shooting in Los Angeles because that case is heating up and DOJ is involved and Bill Lann Lee will be at the radio address - also don't mention Shepard because our legislative strategy is stay away from the gay issue - mention James Byrd and maybe the Korean church and Coach Byrdsong cases in the Midwest. You could make a statement that the hate crimes bill is about protecting the civil rights of all Americans.""

But perhaps Afridi didn't follow all of Smith's guidance. According to a transcript and audio recording of the address Clinton delivered the next day, the president mentioned Shepard and the Los Angeles shooting. Here's what Clinton said:",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/jason-collins-meets-shepards/story?id=22713600,"DENVER -- Brooklyn Nets center Jason Collins met privately with the parents and brother of the late Matthew Shepard following the team's 112-89 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Thursday night at Pepsi Center.

The player gave Dennis and Judy Shepard an autographed, No. 98 black and white jersey, and laughter could be heard throughout the 10-minute meeting.

Collins, who became the first active openly gay player in NBA history Sunday after signing a 10-day contract with the Nets, wears No. 98 in honor of Shepard, who was beaten, tortured and murdered in a 1998 anti-gay hate crime in Wyoming.

I'm so fortunate to have met Matthew Shepard's parents and brother tonight after @BrooklynNets win tonight in Denver pic.twitter.com/PL6k4TvDsW - Jason Collins (@jasoncollins34) February 28, 2014

""It was great,"" said Judy Shepard, who had spoken with Collins by phone last year after Collins announced he was gay and wore No. 98 because of her son. ""It was all great. He's very kind, smart, humble. It was delightful. We were happy to finally have the opportunity to meet.""

She said receiving his jersey was ""cool. It was very sweet, very genuine and very thoughtful.""

""I did not want to give them a sweaty jersey,"" Collins said with a laugh when asked whether it was game-worn. ""This is a backup.""

The Shepards drove up from Casper, Wyo., to attend the game and meet with Collins, who previously said the opportunity was ""one of those cool treats in life.""

""It's going to be very special meeting with them after the game,"" Collins said before tipoff. ""I'm looking forward to it. ... I was in college at the time he was killed, and of course it was a tragedy. I just hope it inspires others to move forward.""

Denis Shepard said after the meeting that he hopes the day quickly comes when someone's sexuality is a non-issue.

""There should be no publicity over this. It should be just an ordinary, everyday thing, like the military now,"" he said. ""That's what we're hoping for, soon. Thank you very much.""

""His career is the most important thing,"" Judy Shepard added as they walked away. ""That's it.""

Dennis Shepard previously praised Collins, saying he is an inspiration to gay children everywhere by encouraging them to live openly and honestly.

""Jason helps those kids go ahead and live their lives to the fullest, and take their talent in academics, in sports, wherever it can take them,"" Shepard told ESPNNewYork.com's Ian O'Connor on Monday. ""Some kids are still living hidden lives, living in fear, and the more you see Jason and Michael Sam and others encouraging them to be themselves, they'll understand they can get to the top of whatever ladder they're climbing.""

Collins also finished Thursday night's game with three points -- his first three points of the season.

Before Thursday night, Collins, who also picked up four fouls in playing the final eight minutes against the Nuggets, had not scored in an NBA game since April 17, 2013. He missed a shot in each of his first two games with the Nets but connected on the second of a pair of free throws with 2:39 remaining Thursday night, then knocked down a 17-foot jumper exactly a minute later.

Collins was brought in for his ability to defend the post, set hard screens and box out, not score.

Asked whether he was happy to see Collins get into the scoring column, Nets coach Jason Kidd joked, ""I was happy to see him play [eight] minutes and not foul out.""

Collins wore No. 98 with both the Boston Celtics and the Washington Wizards even before coming out last spring. The jersey has been a big seller on NBAStore.com, something Collins said honored Shepard and the Trevor Project, which was established in 1998 and aims to prevent suicide among LGBT youth.

The jersey wasn't ready for his first game with the Nets -- he wore a spare with his name hastily added for the contest against the Lakers on Sunday -- but he wore No. 98 against the Blazers on Wednesday night and against the Nuggets on Thursday night.

Collins said slipping on that jersey with the significance no longer a closely held secret meant a lot to him.

""Obviously, it started off my friends and family knew why I chose that number, and it's just cool to see that so many people support it as evidenced by so many people buying the jersey,"" he said.

Collins was a free agent when he announced at the end of last season that he is gay, and the 35-year-old center remained unsigned until the Nets needed another big man.

with new questions about the mysterious death of a young Texas dad. You may remember from earlier in the month local officials insisted Alfred Wright's death was not a homicide. A conclusion questioned by a pathologist hired by the family and ABC's Steve osunsami says there is no evidence that the initial investigation was botched. Reporter: This morning there are explosive new allegations in the case of Alfred Wright, a 28-year-old physical therapist and father of three whose mysterious death shocked families in the small town of jasper, Texas, when he was found dead after being missing for 19 days. Authorities thought it was a drug overdose but now his family isn't believing it. This is one of the worst investigated cases of Texas history. Reporter: In an exclusive interview with ABC news private investigator chuck foreman tells us Wright's family hired him soon after he disappeared and police failed to properly investigate. They have not interviewed the family. They have not searched the truck. They just didn't do the due diligence that you demand from law enforcement. Reporter: And now another turn. Foreman is looking into the possibility that he may have known Cindy had ducks, the adult daughter of the sheriff who worked the case. They knew each other locally from physical therapy work. That is not only thing. There was many other indicators that didn't add up. Reporter: Among them foreman says his search team found Wright's body in the same wooded area police claimed they searched days earlier in what he calls an unnatural position. Then there's the autopsy calling the death an accidental drug overdose and ruling out homicide. Wright's family says he didn't do drugs. It was completely not like Alfred to run from his responsibilities. Reporter: There's the second autopsy commissioned by the family including he sustained serious and gruesome injuries suggesting foul play. When a person is found at 28 years old unclothed in the woods, how could you not treat it as a criminal investigation? Reporter: This morning the sheriff's department tells us they have no one available for comment. For ABC news Steve osunsami, Atlanta. Let's bring in ABC's chief legal affairs anchor Dan Abrams. Dan, so many questions raised by the pathologist. Local officials turned this over to the state? They tried to. The local district attorney tried to hand it over to the attorney general. The attorney general said premature for us to look at it. I think that's a mistake. There are a lot of questions here about the relationship between the sheriff to various people involved in this story such that four just the sake of the appearance of propriety I think the attorney general should have taken it over. You've got him calling his wife and saying my truck broke down and an hour later his parents come to pick him up at this convenience store. He's not there. From day one they say the authorities say no foul play. They found his clothes, his I.D., his watch and yet the search was still called off after just four days so there are a lot of questions to ask here. On the other hand, there was also a fair amount of information showing some at least odd behavior. Well, no, the authorities -- the local sheriff would say, look, we did an autopsy. We found significant drugs in his system. There's an eyewitness from the convenience store, a clerk from the convenience store who says they saw him putting his cell phone into his sock and then running off. The authorities claim that's consistent with someone who's high on some sort of drugs but the family says, you know, he never took drugs and no evidence of drugs found either. There's also some talk that this might have been a hate crime. Do you see this becoming a civil rights investigation? I see that the justice department keeping the heat on the local authorities, but I don't think this is going to end up in any sort of federal court but they're definitely going to keep an eye on it and I think the attorney general will have to look into it. Thanks. The newly released jailhouse

http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2014/02/nbas-first-openly-gay-player-has-league-seeing-green/,"When Jason Collins suits up tonight for the Brooklyn Nets, the first openly gay athlete active in the big four professional men's team sports will put on a black-and-white jersey. But to the NBA, it may look green.

Even though Collins, a journeyman center-forward, was only signed to a 10-day contract, the league has taken the unusual step of making his No. 98 jersey available for sale.

The jerseys went on sale at NBAStore.com and the NBA Store in Manhattan after the league received hundreds of inquiries both online and at the store, a league spokesman told ESPN.

The Nets aren't expecting big numbers from Collins, a hard-nosed defensive player who has career averages of 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds per game, but the league seems to see a chance to score.

For his part, Collins has something to say with his jersey, too. He chose No. 98 to commemorate Matthew Shepard, the University of Wyoming student who was murdered in an anti-gay hate crime in 1998.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/jason-collins-98-sale/story?id=22667086,"The NBA decided on Tuesday to make No. 98 Jason Collins jerseys available due to high demand, according to a league spokesman.

The jerseys were available at NBAStore.com and the NBA Store in Manhattan after the league received hundreds of inquiries both online and at the store, the spokesman said.

On Tuesday, Collins' jersey was the top-selling jersey on NBAStore.com.

Collins signed a 10-day contract with the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday, becoming the first active openly gay player in league history.

The Nets can give Collins a second 10-day deal once the first one expires. If they do, once that second deal expires, Brooklyn would have to decide whether to keep him for the rest of the season.

Collins had to wear No. 46 on Sunday because there wasn't enough time to get No. 98 ready for his first game.

He will wear No. 98 -- starting Wednesday night at Portland -- in honor of Matthew Shepard, a student at the University of Wyoming who was tortured, beaten and murdered in an antigay hate crime in 1998.

Dennis Shepard, Matthew's father, confirmed to ESPNNewYork.com's Ian O'Connor in an e-mail that he is planning to attend Thursday night's Nets-Nuggets game in Denver with his wife Judy, son Logan and Logan's girlfriend.

Ray Sheppard, 37, no relation to Dennis, came into the NBA Store looking for a Collins jersey at 8:30 p.m.

Sheppard, though, decided to either come back to purchase a cheaper version or get one online because the only Collins jerseys in stock were the $250 authenics.

""It just came out and I wanted to be supportive,"" said Sheppard, a Brooklyn resident who has rooted for the Nets ever since they moved to the borough at the start of the 2012-13 season. ""I think it's great that Jason is the first (openly gay player).""

According to a store employee who was working in the area, three authentic Collins jerseys were purchased after they first went up on the rack at around 5 p.m.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/jason-collins-makes-nba-return/story?id=22644451,"LOS ANGELES -- Jason Collins became the first openly gay athlete to play in North America's four major professional team sports Sunday when he played 11 minutes in the Brooklyn Nets' 108-102 win over the Los Angeles Lakers at Staples Center.

Collins, 35, entered the game to a modest applause from the Lakers' crowd with 10:28 to go in the second quarter and finished with two rebounds and five fouls. He missed his only field goal attempted and did not score, but played nearly seven minutes in the decisive fourth quarter and showed he can still play defense and set bruising screens that free up his teammates.

""It was a lot of fun to get back out on the court and set screens and hard fouls,"" Collins said afterwards. ""I didn't take any charges tonight, that'll change. I'll get in position next time. But it felt good to get back out there on the court.

""The most important thing is, the team got the win. I don't care about scoring, I care about my team winning, helping my teammates get open, and making their job easier.""

Collins held news conferences before and after Sunday night's game, which was something of a novelty for a player who has been a role player in his previous 12 NBA seasons.

And on Tuesday, the NBA will start selling Jason Collins authentic and replica jerseys in all sizes, as well as T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts, a practice not common for players on a 10-day contract.

But neither he nor his teammates felt the hoopla surrounding his return to the NBA after revealing his sexual orientation last April had been a distraction.

""I don't think it'll be like this every single day,"" Collins said of the attention surrounding his return to the court. ""There's only so many questions you guys can ask.""

Brooklyn point guard Deron Williams, who played with Collins' twin brother Jarron as a member of the Utah Jazz, said that he was proud to be a part of a historic night but ultimately didn't think it felt all that different from any other game he's played in.

""It's definitely a big moment,"" Williams said. ""I'm happy for him. I know he's been sitting around waiting for a job, so I'm happy to see him on a team and happy that he's on our team.

""He was huge for us tonight. He made some big plays on defense, I thought he played great defense on Pau [Gasol]. He's a heck of a screener. I played with his brother and they play similar. He's a heck of a screener and he gets you open. He was instrumental in this win tonight.""

Once he got back out onto the court, Collins said those screens were the highlight of his night.

""My favorite part of the evening, I think it was Jordan Farmar was complaining to the refs that I was setting an illegal pick,"" Collins said.

Asked if he was frustrated that it took until this late in the season for him to get an opportunity to play in the NBA again, Collins said simply, ""I know that I'm capable of playing in the NBA. I think I showed that tonight.""

Collins said he kept himself in shape these last 10 months with five-mile trail runs, sprints, extensive work in the weight room and skill work.

""I always stayed positive,"" Collins said. ""That's one of the things I pride myself on is being a professional, and part of being a professional is always being ready, always training. There were times this past winter when I'm running my five-mile trail run and it's just me and the trail, running and working hard, so that if get an opportunity, at least I can say I'm in great condition.""

That he was able to debut in his hometown of Los Angeles, in front of family and friends, was even sweeter.

""I'm very happy for him,"" his twin brother Jarron told ESPN. ""I've seen all the hard work that he's put into staying in shape and to his craft and to his sport. It's going to be a challenge with the layoff that he's had, but it's something he's done for the last 12 years.""

The Nets are an organization filled with Collins supporters and experienced players less likely to be fazed by the likely media blitz that the signing will inevitably spark. Nets coach Jason Kidd played with Collins in New Jersey from 2001-08, making two trips together to the NBA Finals. Collins also played with Nets guard Joe Johnson for three seasons in Atlanta and spent half of the 2012-13 season in Boston alongside Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett before being traded to the Wizards.

""It's basketball. It doesn't change. His teammates did a great job and so did Jason,"" Kidd said. ""We're a team. It's one the Brooklyn Nets found a way to get a win.""

The Nets signed Collins to a 10-day contract Sunday morning after trading Reggie Evans to Sacramento on Wednesday and missing out on forward Glen Davis, who was bought out by Orlando on Friday.

With veteran forward Garnett sitting out the second night of back-to-backs for the foreseeable future, as he did Sunday night, there was a sentiment within the Nets organization to sign Collins regardless of Davis' decision.

Collins wore No. 46 in Sunday's game but will wear No. 98 for the remainder of his time with the Nets. Because of the speed with which he was signed Sunday, there wasn't time to prepare that jersey number in time for tipoff.

Collins' choice of the No. 98 is in honor of Matthew Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who died in a notorious anti-gay hate crime in 1998. Collins has worn the jersey number with both the Celtics and Wizards.

Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov, who had to sign off on the acquisition of Collins, said last year as a candidate for the Russian presidency that he was against his country's anti-gay laws that became such a large focus at the recently-concluded Winter Olympics in Sochi.

""I think we are breaching the international convention of human rights and freedoms we have signed,"" Prokhorov said last year. ""My position is very simple: This is a personal affair. It is a personal affair who has sex with whom.""

Collins' opponents Sunday night, the Lakers, knew the significance of Collins' return but focused on business as usual as much as they could.

""Us players, we just focus on playing the game, and it is remarkable and you definitely have to respect and applaud his courage in this situation,"" Gasol said. ""So I was happy to see him out there. Happy that he got an opportunity to play and got this 10-day contract. Hopefully he'll get a next one and hopefully he'll finish the season with their team. I feel like he's in really good shape and is going to be able to help them.

""I think both brothers have always been, for my entire career, have been great guys, great competitors and I respected their game, their attitude, their professionalism. I think everywhere they've been, they stood out because of it. But now obviously [Jason] has become an icon and he's going to have to carry some responsibility with it, which I think he's fine with that.""

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was dismissive of questions about Collins.

""I think it's no big deal, and that's the way it should be,"" Cuban said Monday. ""Twin's been playing in the league forever. Guys know him. As long as they get their asses kicked when they play us, that's all I care about.

""I don't give a s--- about a guy's sexuality. Period. End of story.

""I don't think it matters. I think it's over. Shouldn't have been a big deal, wasn't a big deal and we move on. Nothing to talk about. I think at some point it becomes nothing to talk about, and now it's nothing to talking about. Moving on.""

Cuban said the Mavericks did consider bringing in Collins over the summer, but it wasn't a fit. Dallas currently has 15 players under contract, so bringing Collins in after that wasn't an option.

http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/michael-sams-safe-havens/story?id=22530851,"HITCHCOCK, Texas -- From inside Galveston County Jail, where he's awaited trial since his January arrest, Josh Sam caught clips of the interview, rebroadcast on local news. It surprised him to hear his brother was gay. It surprised him to hear it in such a public forum. But as he watched, Josh Sam knew something clearly.

The fact that his brother was on television, the fact that the world cared about his announcement, the fact that Michael Sam might soon become the first openly gay player in the NFL meant something good. It meant his little brother didn't follow his wayward example.

""If I was talking to him now, I would tell him I don't judge him,"" Josh Sam said, his voice heard through a television monitor by which he can speak with visitors. ""I'm proud of him for not becoming like me. I still love him, whatever his lifestyle is. He's still my brother and I love him.""

Following a path like that of his brothers, Josh and Chris, both in Galveston County Jail, would have been easy for Michael. He spent his childhood watching his older brothers struggle with family tragedies and peer pressure. The kid they called Mikey at home didn't want any part of that life.

""Growing up was very hard, very hard to see the things that I saw,"" Michael Sam said in the interview with ESPN's ""Outside the Lines,"" during which he first announced his sexual orientation. ""Police coming in our homes, for my brothers, arresting them. I accidentally got maced before as a kid. ... It was hard. It was scary. No kid should ever have to see that or go through that. Being who I am now, I knew that I didn't want to go down that road like my brothers. I wanted to make a name for myself, and so I surrounded myself with good people, and I played sports, and football was my safe haven.""

Some greeted Sam's announcement awkwardly in his hometown of Hitchcock, Texas. The school district hesitated to grant interviews, eventually and reluctantly making football coach Craig Smith available to several outlets. The day after Sam's announcement, the district released a statement saying how proud it was of Sam's football accomplishments and that he called Hitchcock home, never mentioning anything about his being gay. All day reporters and cameras had descended upon the normally quiet town.

But those who knew Michael Sam best barely even reacted. To them, the hubbub was far more perplexing.

They saw him survive and thrive despite an environment that could have meant an early death or imprisonment. They saw the gregarious kid who was always singing something or another succeed where even some in Hitchcock didn't think he would. They saw him develop the kind of strength he needed to become a pioneer.

Hitchcock, with approximately 7,000 residents, is a town in which it's not uncommon to see a horse or a cow in a yard or hear a rooster crowing as you pass. The median income is about $29,000, and homes average $128,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. City Hall is a small, brown building on Highway 6, one of two major roads that cross through a town that's part of a heavily conservative region.

It's a town one might drive past without even noticing on the way from Houston to Galveston. Michael Sam was one of the best-known people to come out of Hitchcock, even before becoming the most talked-about football player in America.

He started the conversations there two years ago.

One of his first stops was to Ronnie Purl, a man who became like a second father to Sam, who had a complicated relationship with family. He told Purl he was gay.

""No s---,"" Purl said, with his characteristic glibness. Purl recalled the conversation this week. Sitting behind his desk at Prosperity Bank on Highway 6, he laughed heartily at the memory.

""I said, 'Michael, I've known that for years,'"" Purl said.

Sam asked why Purl never brought it up.

""Why would I make you feel uncomfortable in your own home?"" Purl replied.

That's what the Purl home became to Michael Sam. The relationship started when Candy Purl, Ronnie's wife, invited Michael to dinner during his freshman year of high school. Ronnie, a man with a personality much bigger than he is, discovered a kid he didn't recognize and demanded to know, ""And who are you?""

""Without skipping a beat, my brother replied, 'I'm Michael Alan Sam Jr.!,'"" said Ethan Purl, Ronnie's son. ""And after that, he never left.""

It didn't take many more days for Ethan to start considering Sam family.

Despite all the time Sam spent at the Purls' house, Ronnie has never met Sam's parents.

Ethan, too, had a hunch Sam was gay but never asked, wanting instead to let Michael tell him when he was comfortable.

Sam never fully moved in to the Purls' home, but he'd stay there for days at a time when he couldn't stay at home. He helped around the house and learned how to cook -- Candy taught most recipes, Ronnie taught gumbo.

When the boys messed up, they were all punished the same -- Ethan, Michael Sam and Michael Nyberg, a teammate of Sam's whom the Purls adopted. Candy once caught the boys drinking beer on the porch after they'd snuck out of the house late one night when all three were upperclassmen at Hitchcock High School.

""When Mom came around the corner, she smelled beer automatically and called our names out,"" Nyberg said.

They woke up at 5:30 the next morning to start mowing the lawn on about three hours of sleep.

""The Purls don't sleep in,"" said Nyberg, who is now a train conductor. ""Michael Sam knew that. When he came over, we told him, 'We're not sleeping in. We're going to be doing chores. We're going to do anything that Dad asks and Mom asks.' They were teaching us responsibility. That's pretty much what the Purls were doing.""

The first time he left Hitchcock for college, Michael's mother, JoAnn Sam, was supposed to take him. When she backed out at the last minute, Ronnie Purl proposed a road trip to his wife. They loaded a truck at 3 a.m. and headed to Columbia, Mo. As they drove away, leaving Michael to the next chapter of his life, Ronnie saw Michael shrinking in his rearview mirror, waving until he became a tiny speck.

""I guess he latched onto us as much as we latched onto him,"" Ronnie said.

The Purls' home became a safe haven for Sam. He found another with the high school football team.

They were places Sam focused his energies as he grew into adolescence. They helped him avoid snares that might have derailed someone else. His tragic family history had that impact on his brother Josh.

""We've been through a whole lot of deaths,"" said Josh Sam. At 29, he's the oldest of the living Sam children. Chris is 28 and Michael is 24.

The first was Chanel Sam, who died as a toddler before her future siblings were born. Then, Russell Sam was shot to death while breaking into a home in the mid-1990s.

""It was kind of hard, 11 or 12 [years old], coming home from school, see my mom crying, saying, 'Your brother was shot,'"" Josh Sam said. ""Seeing him in the casket. Two or three years later, [another] brother came up missing. When my brother died, I really started going down the wrong road. ... We all was in our own zone. Really, we all took different ways. It was just a hard time for our mother.""

Julian Sam, then a teenager, went missing in 1998, a few years after Russell was killed. He has not been found.

Five of the family's eight children are still living.

JoAnn Sam could not be reached for this story and hasn't done any interviews. She discouraged Josh from speaking and instructed him not to give any information about her. Her relationship with Michael remains complicated. As a Jehovah's Witness, she didn't like her son playing football.

""Sometimes, I would argue and I got kicked out of the house, and I didn't have no place to stay,"" Michael Sam said. ""Sometimes, I stayed at the school, the high school, and I'd bounce around to my friends' house.""

Still, during that same interview with ""Outside the Lines,"" Sam called his mother his role model.

Despite his mother's resistance, he started playing football in seventh grade and immediately caught the local coaches' attention.

""I didn't know his mom and dad,"" said Craig Smith, Hitchcock's head football coach, who has coached in town for nearly 20 years. ""Easiest, nicest way I can say about it. Small school. I know a lot of people in town, but I didn't know his mom and dad. That's why you take a kid in the eighth grade and get him involved in the program. It's just kind of our job as coaches. There's a lot of good people that's helped take care of Michael throughout the years here.""

Sam surprised adults by shaking their hands -- more mature than many of his peers -- and he always introduced himself as Michael Alan Sam.

The gregarious kid fit in fine with the high school players; he was constantly talking and inviting attention. A school as small as Class 2A Hitchcock often needs to bring freshman onto the varsity team, and Sam was one of the chosen. He was big and played offense and defense. By his senior year, he was the best player on the team. The future SEC defensive player of the year became the only one in his graduating class to get a scholarship to a big-time college program.

He made friends easily and always had a No. 2 pencil behind his ear. And he sang. A lot.

""It sounded like he just made it up,"" Nyberg said of Sam's songs.

It wasn't just noise.

""I sing because it takes, for a brief second, it takes a little from my past and just in that moment I'm just happy and I'm glad to be who I am,"" Sam said. ""That's the reason why. I like to be joyful and happy and joke around with my team. And it takes me away from all of that.""

The state of Texas's history with gay men and women is uneven, a mixture of acceptance in some parts and hate in others.

Just 40 miles away from Hitchcock, Houston recently re-elected Mayor Annise Parker, a lesbian who married her longtime partner in California last month. In 2013, 326 miles away, just outside of Fort Worth, a gay man was beaten so severely he required plastic surgery. It's not the only example of a hate crime against a gay man in Texas, and those instances shape national perception of the state's attitude.

Much of Hitchcock's reaction didn't fit that impression. Many residents or former residents responded defensively when Sam announced his sexual orientation -- even those who didn't personally know Sam -- challenging anyone who might react negatively.

""Hitchcock is very diverse,"" Ronnie Purl said. ""They'll come to his defense. Might be a small community, but we're strong.""

Former teammates and cousins posted supportive messages on Facebook. One Internet meme circulated with Sam's picture and the words ""Hitchcock strong, we love you Mike.""

""A lot of students don't quite see the parameter that it really may touch upon,"" said Morris Tuck, a defensive coach who has been at Hitchcock High School for 19 years. ""It appears to me everybody's been very supportive. People just in general are more supportive of that kind of thing anyway. I think it's just kind of more becoming our society, I'm not gonna say expectation, but it's not so out of the ordinary as it may have been 20 years ago.""

While most have given support, not all of it has been without hesitation. Even from family. Michael Sam let his father know in a text message that he is gay.

Michael Sam Sr. has oscillated. In a few interviews, he spoke of his love for his son and pride in his accomplishments. In another, with The New York Times, he expressed concern about grandchildren being raised in ""that environment,"" saying he was a ""man-and-a-woman type of guy."" He later said he was misquoted.

Josh Sam said he hasn't spoken to his brother Michael in nearly a year. Their lives are so different right now.

According to Galveston County records, 44 charges have been brought against Josh Sam since 2001, a majority of them non-violent misdemeanors, though his two most recent charges were for assault, one listed from Dec. 30, 2013, and the other Jan. 2, 2014.

He can watch TV during the day in the day room at the jail, where 60 percent of the inmates are awaiting trial. The channel is selected by a vote among the inmates who can select among educational channels or local television stations. They often watch the local news. Josh doesn't see his brother Chris because members of the same family are kept separate in the Galveston County Jail. Chris, who was charged with four felonies in June 2012 -- four of 23 charges against him since 2003 -- is not allowed visitors right now.

Was it hard to avoid the life they chose?

""Very difficult,"" Josh Sam said. ""There's a lot of peer pressure, lot of drugs, violence.""

But Michael did it.

""Is he in the NFL yet?"" Josh Sam asks through that television monitor, having followed Michael's college career closely.

Not yet, but he might be drafted in May.

""Do they know which team will draft him?""

It's a question that's been parsed in the week since Michael Sam's public revelation about being gay and one that centers around both football and non-football considerations -- even though Sam had his best season after telling his college teammates he is gay. Some NFL executives have made clear that his sexual orientation wouldn't impact their evaluations. Others have anonymously wondered how he would impact team chemistry or how much of a distraction the attention surrounding his announcement would cause.

These questions wouldn't exist without Sam's own determination to not wind up in that Galveston County Jail.

Sam's childhood didn't break him; it steeled him. It gave him the strength to be who he is.",abcnews.com,True

-- -- don't have been truly appreciate we are banning anything we are rounding up anyone. We don't prosecute anyone for such relations unlike many other countries. So one can feel relaxed and at ease but please leave the children entities. -- Children in peace that was -- burden on Friday defending the law that -- overshadow these Olympic Games. It -- quote non traditional sexual relationships to minors it's causing a propaganda -- that's causing a global uproar some boycotts. And questions over how rush we'll treat gay athletes and -- next month. When the law passed all summer protests quickly spread. President Obama weighed -- -- nobody is more feminine than me by some of the anti gay and lesbian legislation that you've been seeing him in Russia and one of things I'm really looking forward -- -- -- Maybe some gay and lesbian athletes. Bring an -- gold or silver bronze. And I wonder if you could respond to that and if gay or lesbian athletes engage in some sort of protest. Where rainbow pin or some other kind of protest would they be free from prosecution under the propaganda law. Cockpit but it -- -- of protest and tax of propaganda. Are somewhat different things out there close but if we were to look at them from the legal perspective. -- protesting the law does not amount to propaganda of homosexuality. -- sexual abuse of children. That's ones too is that I'd like to ask our colleagues my colleagues and friends that. As they try to criticize us they would do well to set their own house in order first. I did say after all and this is public knowledge that in some of the states in the US homosexuality. Remains a felony. Supreme Court has struck those -- down and we'll take it -- it must. How are they in a position to criticize us and for what -- -- much softer liberal approach to these issues than in their own country. I know that this isn't something that can be easily done. This is so because there are a lot of folks in the US who share the view that the legislation in their state or in their nation is appropriate the well grounded and is in sync with the sentiment of the vast majority of the population. Brussels gay activists say the climate there is getting -- The gondolas are almost the least of it it's a huge concerted campaign that's unleashed by the -- -- a campaign of hate and violence. So basically it's a law that and try and second class citizenship you know. That the mutual option Anemia -- has nothing to do with persecuting people for their non traditional orientation -- In this country everybody is absolutely equal to anybody else. Irrespective of one's religion sex ethnicity or sexual orientation. Everybody says he can only see some oh concerns exist for people who intend to comments athletes or visitors to the Olympics. But just yesterday this Russian protestor was detained -- -- a rainbow flag during the Olympic Torch relay. -- had no comment about president Obama's decision not to condescension. Appointed protest the president underscored by naming prominent gays and lesbians like Billie Jean King to the US delegation. She spoke to are -- robot. And hopefully it will be a watershed moment and a because of the gay rights. And for the LG BT community. Bringing it to the forefront it is the civil rights issue of the 21 century. So I'm very proud to be openly gay for me personally if -- still. Young enough to be going to the Olympics to perform this would give me such high incentive -- crazed. -- like -- let's go what would you say. To couldn't. To put -- yes please change this law. Because it's inclusive. Champion everyone. Fool's gold medals at the Russian people have their own cultural code their own tradition mean we don't interfere if we don't stick our noses in their life. And we ask that our traditions and culture are treated with the same respect. His position keep sports and politics separate and when pressed -- -- and pushes back. But -- -- -- will that Russia does not criminally prosecute people for being gay unlike each in over 13 of the world's nations. Seventy of the world's nations consider homosexual behavior -- crime seven out of the seventy use capital punishment for homosexuality. But that won't. At the -- what does it mean it doesn't mean we need to cancel any major international sports events in those countries you probably not. Putin's critics fear the real crackdown will come after Sochi. Including proposed legislation threatening to take custody of children away from gay parents. That's -- -- and her partner left Russia -- their children last month. I wouldn't be surprised if if the Olympics went off without a hitch in terms of -- anti terror legislation. Russia doesn't want scandals what -- discipline thing. -- parents so I think that we're not going to see Kenya possibly any incidents. During Olympics. But what happens after the Olympics. Is -- -- -- scary. Act now the -- wanted to David -- -- -- the Davies reporter for many years and from the Soviet Union from Moscow. And you know who clearly he's doing these interviews he wants to reassure people but in some way even -- -- one point off camera was that a lot of gay friends. As well but in some ways he can help himself he actually believes this law. Is the right thing doesn't want to change at any even tied it at some point to the need to increase birth rates. -- -- It's a completely disingenuous answer that he gave -- because this law. Has given the signal for hate crimes all over the country a load loads of hate crimes which are horrible in this videos of it on YouTube all over the place. Second of all it's allowed the it's given the -- to the state media which is this television is the key. To be completely and utterly homophobic. To turn on the television -- Russian orthodox -- members of parliament speaker of the most disgusting homophobic. Way possible. Is completely dispiriting highly influential. And completely sanctioned by the Kremlin so he's you know one answer is what he says to. Broadcasters right in the edge of the Olympics and there are some clemency as they came out as well. But this -- had an enormous effect hard to believe that I -- you name them that he'll actually go through with punishing people during. You wouldn't -- campus that. Yes and can I just say. I'm so sick of sports and politics -- -- -- someone can't that I am. Not gay and I know many internal for the death. And all my gay friends think changed -- looks so buck and his shirtless. -- didn't think -- why is even talking about this. He has to talk about it it's a huge -- I was involved unsuccessfully in the latest race. Contest championed nationally because I can't think -- I'm gonna Sherry had -- no country is that we're gonna get -- with the gang. That has any thing close to any kind of gay laws anything like that this is just didn't doesn't want these things where. History is going to move out. They're not gonna deal with this again and so anybody can watch it if they got somebody's dialogue -- that they're gonna have to clean him up because they've done by the committee before they want this is going unnoticed because his painful for these guys don't do you really think we see -- from from from this is the fears over the terrorist threat. As well and is some of the companies just about every major life and. Here's an air strike -- yes -- and that of course is the great issue that will overwhelm. What we have been talking about I think -- He is the head. They they country -- empire in a way that is going to be seeing more and more of the sort of thing it saw recently in the former Stalingrad the the northern caucuses.

Satisfying various as sports and politics didn't she -- -- expect to see protests. I think it will be protest. And I was that he was the former California governor who wants a steady -- in the morning to read the sports pages first because they told remains accomplishment. Rather that is this is -- -- And now if it get that seems to -- state media the ultimate irony here it is dead -- that games that are supposed to be about all the things that we. That we love and cherish what it means to be human being. -- -- tarnished by. This talk about gay rights and did that that the threat of terrorism and I think you're right. An ingredient you give him that he's concerned as he should be if people aren't going to show up because they're afraid of what might happen anyway. Against take place in the world and when Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists in 1968. Who took place in the world and it had an effect and this argument it's a legitimate argument to have.

When the pope said those words, who am I to judge when asked about gay priests. It signaled a sea change in the acceptance of gays. So much change, capped by a supreme court historic sanctioning of gay marriage. Here's abc's david wright. Reporter: From the highest court in the land -- tonight, landmark ruling. The supreme court redefines the modern american family. Reporter: -- To the most competitive court in the land. You always knew you were gay? Yes. I describe that you know the sky is blue but you keep telling yourself it's red. Reporter:2013 was a game changer. From the church and its new more accepting pope and state after state after state legalizing gay marriage, 2013 broke the rainbow ceiling. The biggest year for gay and lesbian rights since the stonewall riots 30 years ago. This has been a good year for the gay and lesbian community. Yes, it's kind of funny. Reporter: Soccer star robbie rogers of the l.A. Galaxy is living that change in realtime. Earlier this year, he posted a courageous note to his blog and became the first professional soccer player in history to tell his fans that he's gay. I was nervous. After I sent it, I felt so much lighter. Reporter: Other athletes have come out after they already left their respective sports. But active players, openly gay? Unheard of in american sports. At least on a professional level, until this year. Not only did rogers come in, so did nba veteran jason collins. Who sat down with george. Martina navratilova said that this is going to save some kids lives. I look to her as one of my heroes. Hopefully, I can be someone else's role model. Reporter: Collins made the cover of ""sports illustrated."" He chose the number 98 to honor matthew shepard, a young, gay man murdered in 1998 hate crime. What do you say to those who want to be a pro ballplayer and happens to be gay? It doesn't matter that you're gay, but the key thing is that it's about basketball. Reporter: Pro sports is of course high pressure and high profile, almost stereotypically manly, but so is another helm of american life. That saw a huge shift in attitudes in 2013. The u.S. Military, having already dropped its long-standing ban on gay and lesbian service, this year, it extended full benefits to same-sex spouses. Astonishingly, the u.S. Military is now more open than u.S. Professional sports. If the military can change, surely the locker room can change? Yeah, you would think so. Reporter: For the armed services came as an immediate consequence of the u.S. Supreme court ruling this year in a landmark case brought by edie windsor, who spoke with diane sawyer. When you see the words that edie windsor versus the united states of america. When I first saw it I was terrified. What have I done? Then I gradually understood that the government wasn't going to be permanently mad at me. They got married in 2007. It took the u.S. Supreme court to make it happen. When you heard the ws, what did you do? Cried, first thing. Okay? And the room was full of people screaming and crying at the same time. Reporter: Sadly, her wife did not live to see it. Do you think about what you would like to say to her? I said, honey, it's done. I know what she would say. She would say, you did it, honey. Reporter: The latest abc news polling data finds that support for gay marriage is at an all-time high, 58% of americans now say it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to wed. Ironically, one of the most financial backers of the minority view, donating hundreds of money to anti-gay is robbie rogers' new boss. Has he said anything to you? No, he hasn't. No conversation at all? No conversation at all. Reporter: Rogers says his fans and his family have been every bit of accepting he could hope. Everything that happened has been the exact opposite of what I thought would happen. I come from a very catholic, conservative family. Reporter: He said there have been a few abusive remarks from the sideline, but mostly from fans of rival teams. It's usually when we're winning. Reporter: Not like jackie robinson? No, no. I don't like when people compare jason collins to him. Because people wanted to kill him. Reporter: The place he was most worried about -- the locker room. So, any awkward moments in the locker room at all? For the most part, no. Especially in our locker room, our guys are very respectful. We make jokes. Reporter: What kind of jokes? I'm the first person they come to for fashion advice. I'm like, come on, are you serious? Reporter: Rogers' experience is in keeping with other hi high-profile americans. It hasn't made their careers miss a beat. There are about 6,000 professional athletes in this country, exactly two of whom are out, you and jason collins, what do you suspect the real number is? I have no clue. Not one has reached out to me. I haven't spoken to any -- any other athletes that are closeted. Reporter: No one has reached out to you? No, no, and I have had thousands and thousands of e-mails and letters and everything, from people from everywhere, everywhere around the world. Reporter: It's amazing. Nothing.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And the young girl who inspired us all by defying fear. New exclusive interviews, insights and analysis, the game changers of 2013. They changed the world. And they're right here this Sunday morning.

ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, This Week with George Stephanopoulos starts now.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Hello again. I hope you're enjoying this holiday week, one we're marking with a special look back at the people who broke through and made a big difference in 2013. Our ""This Week"" game changers.

We've got some surprising revelations and brand-new interviews, starting with Texas Senator Ted Cruz. It is hard to remember a freshman senator stealing the spotlight so quickly and with such force. He stopped the government in its tracks for 16 days. To cheers from Tea Party activists, jeers from Democrats and some establishment Republicans too. But that's not slowing Cruz a bit. He's setting his sights on higher office.

ABC's chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl has his story.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: When it comes to politics, you could say this has been the year of Ted Cruz.

SEN. TED CRUZ, (R) TEXAS: It's government that needs more help.

KARL: Aside from the president, no one attracted more attention or more controversy. Cruz went from obscurity to leading presidential candidate in a political nanosecond, the man at the center of the government shutdown ended 2013 as a runner-up to the pope as TIME's person of the year.

Most first year senators lay low. This one ended up on the couch next to Jay Leno. JAY LENO, TONIGHT SHOW HOST: I have been reading a lot about you lately. And they describe you as aggressive, arrogant and abrasive. Accurate.

CRUZ: Well, I don't know that you can believe everything you read.

What I'm trying to do is do my job. And, occasionally people don't like that.

KARL: Do you want people in Washington to like you?

CRUZ: You know, Jon, what I want to do is I want to serve 26 million Texans. I want to do my job. That's really my focus.

KARL: Do you care -- I mean, does it bother you that a lot of people around here just don't like you?

CRUZ: Nobody should be surprised if you're trying to change Washington, that the Washington establishment pushes back.

KARL: And push back they did. Just weeks after his swearing- in...

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Cruz of Texas.

KARL: ...Cruz seemed to be off to a rough start, quickly rubbing his new colleagues in the senate the wrong way.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator Cruz has gone over the line.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not a sixth grader. Senator, I have been on this committee for 20 years.

KARL: Senator John McCain branded Cruz and his fellow Tea Partyers in congress wacko birds, an insult to be sure, but Cruz didn't seem to mind.

CRUZ: You know, if standing for liberty, if standing for free market principles and the constitution makes you a wacko bird, then I am a very proud wacko bird.

KARL: A supporter even made a wacko bird hat that Cruz proudly displays in his office.

There was a brief moment early on when Cruz, after Obama met with senate Republicans, talked of working with the president.

CRUZ: I welcome the president coming to Capitol Hill to meet with us. I look forward to doing everything I can to work productively, for us to roll up our sleeves and get the economy growing again.

KARL: That didn't last long as Cruz laid out the gold that would turn Washington upside-down, defunding Obamacare before agreeing to fund the government.

At first, Republican leaders rejected the idea.

REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) OHIO: Our goal here is to cut spending, it's not to shut down the government.

KARL: But Cruz refused to go along with the Republican leadership. He gave an all day, all night speech, the second longest in the history of the senate.

CRUZ: I intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand.

This grand experiment three-and-a-half years ago is quite simply not working.

KARL: He went on for more than 21 hours without sitting or even taking a bathroom break, filling time in some creative ways.

CRUZ: Mike Lee, I am your father.

Jay said redneck rule number one, most things can be fixed with duct tape and extension cords. That's actually very true.

I don't like them Sam I am. I do not like green eggs and ham.

KARL: The speech made Cruz a national figure, a rallying point for those who agreed with him and those who didn't, giving plenty of material for late-night comedians.

JON STEWART, THE DAILY SHOW: In the land of D.C., in the Senate of snooze, lived the showboatiest blab whose name was Ted Cruz.

KARL: Cruz found his most receptive audience among House conservatives, meeting secretly one night in the middle of the government shutdown with Tea Partiers in a Mexican restaurant on Capitol Hill called at Tortilla Coast.

You had a famous meeting right here in this restaurant. What was that like meeting with those House Republicans? They, in a way, were looking to you as a leader.

CRUZ: Well, we had lots of meetings throughout the year and throughout the shutdown as well. And nobody should be surprised that members of congress are talking to each other. It doesn't happen nearly enough.

KARL: But it's rare to see a senator to have the kind of influence that you had, especially a freshman senator, a first-year senator, over the House.

CRUZ: Well, with respect, I actually don't think it was a case of my having influence at all. I think it's a case of the American people having influence.

KARL: Right, but this was a strategy that you were putting forth and they jumped on board. CRUZ: Well, no, this is something that a lot of people came forward and agreed with. And at the end of the day, the conservatives who met here at Tortilla Coast, who met repeatedly and continue to have conversations, what we were trying to do is listen to the American people, listen to those over 2 million people who are saying this thing ain't working.

KARL: The House Republicans went along with the Cruz strategy and the government shut down for 16 days, a move widely seen as a political disaster for Republicans that accomplished nothing.

But the day Republicans caved and congress voted to reopen the government, Cruz declared victory.

CRUZ: We saw the House of Representatives take a courageous stand listening to the American people, that was a remarkable victory.

KARL: As the year draws to a close, Republican leaders have made it clear they think the strategy pushed by Cruz and outside conservative groups was a total failure.

BOEHNER: Frankly, I just think that they've lost all credibility. You know, they pushed us into this fight to defund Obamacare and to shut down the government. If you recall, one of these groups stood up and said, well, we never really thought it would work. Are you kidding me?

KARL: But the year also ended with Ted Cruz as the most high- profile Tea Party consecutive in congress. Again at Tortilla Coast, Cruz reflected on all of that.

When you think about the tradition of first-year senators, they tend to be seen but not heard, you have had, you said, a whirlwind for a first year as a U.S. senator, does that surprise you? I mean, you're on TIME magazine's list as the runner-up to the pope for person of the year.

CRUZ: That was a very strange thing.

This is a city where it's all politics all the time. And I'm trying to do my best not to pay attention to the politics, to focus on fixing the problems.

KARL: Really?

CRUZ: I know that's hard to believe, but because no one in this town does that. This is a time for people to step up and do the right thing and that's what I'm trying to do.

KARL: You have had a couple of months to think about this whole government shutdown strategy. Now that it's over in hindsight, are you prepared to say that it was a mistake, it wasn't the right tactic?

CRUZ: I think it was absolutely a mistake for President Obama and Harry Reid to force a government shutdown.

KARL: Now you know even John Boehner has said this was a Republican shutdown.

CRUZ: Look, I can't help what other people say.

And Jon, I understand that in the media, every day the media reported the Republicans shut the government down...

KARL: No, I mean, but come on. I mean we're a couple months away from this, the only reason why this happened is because you insisted, Republicans insisted that Obamacare be defunded as a condition of funding the government. If you didn't -- if you took away that insistence, there would be no shutdown. I mean, really.

CRUZ: You've got conservatives who stood strong and said let's stop the train wreck that is Obamacare, and you've got Democrats in the middle of the shutdown, President Obama called every Senate Republican to the White House, sat us in a room and said I called you to tell you, we're not going to negotiate, we're not going to compromise on anything.

Repeatedly Republicans were compromising, trying to find a middle ground. And repeatedly Democrats said, no compromise, shut it down.

KARL: One of the odder signs of Cruz's new celebrity is the new coloring book about him.

There is a Ted Cruz coloring book. This is the number one selling coloring book on Amazon.

CRUZ: Jon, if ever there were a sign that the world is a crazy place, that is it. I didn't know about it...

KARL: You obviously had no idea until it came out. I don't want to take a coloring book all that seriously, but it does say in this coloring book that you're filibuster was so important, because millions of citizens believe Obamacare is worse than any war and that more people will die as a result of illness because of Obamacare than in all of the wars since World War II.

CRUZ: Now, let me ask you, Jon, just for clarification, is this the first time anyone has ever been on your show cross examined for a coloring book.

KARL: It is the first time I have ever questioned a political figure over a coloring book.

But Obamacare is not worse than war.

CRUZ: No, of course not.

KARL: One more thing, when it comes to the year that was, feathers ruffled, the shutdown, the late-night jokes, Cruz says he has no big regrets.

For This Week, Jonathan Karl, ABC News, Washington.

(END VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks, Jon.

And now we turn to the hacker who made headlines around the world with the most dramatic and extensive intelligence revelations in history.

Edward Snowden revealed a secret surveillance operation that went far beyond anything the public had imagined. It set off alarm bells across the intelligence community, angered America's allies, sparked calls for reform from the president and congress and at least one federal judge believes he uncovered a program that violates our constitution.

He's been called a patriot and traitor, a fugitive and a freedom fighter, how Edward Snowden will spend 2014 and the rest of his life is anyone's guess. And as ABC's Pierre Thomas reports, his dramatic actions in 2013 will reverberate for years to come.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

EDWARD SNOWDEN, NSA LEAKER: My name is Ed Snowden. I'm 29 years old.

PIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: With that, the world was introduced to the mild-mannered IT guy whose revelations would shake the foundations of U.S. national security and fracture international relationships.

SNOWDEN: I had access to, you know the full rosters of everyone working at the NSA, the entire intelligence community, and undercover assets all around the world.

THOMAS: And he used that access to NSA computers to secretly steal a treasure trove of the nation's most sensitive secrets.

Snowden not only stole the secrets, he gave them to the press to publish.

To some, he's a hero, a whistleblower.

To others, a traitor.

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, I don't think Mr. Snowden was a patriot.

THOMAS: Snowden fled the country to Hong Kong and is completely committed to his cause. He wants to expose what he believes are massive violations of privacy done in the name of fighting terror.

SNOWDEN: The public needs to decide whether these programs and policies are right or wrong. This is the truth. This is what's happening. You should decide whether we need to be doing this.

THOMAS: His actions reveal some stunning gaps in national security. He secretly downloaded the material for months undetected and walked out the door.

REP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK: How someone at his level was able to get access, it's hard for me to fathom how this was allowed to happen the way it did.

THOMAS: June 5th, the first explosive leak is published in the British newspaper, ""The Guardian."" It contains details of a top secret court ruling. The public had never seen anything like it -- the bombshell that under court order, Verizon was providing the National Security Agency with phone records of millions of customers. Among the information, the numbers and times of calls being made across the country.

It's something the nation's top spy had publicly denied.

REP. RON WYDEN (D), OREGON: Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?

JAMES CLAPPER, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: No, sir.

WYDEN: It does not?

CLAPPER: Not wittingly.

THOMAS: The leaks sent shock waves throughout the entire U.S. intelligence community.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Time and time again, the American people were told one thing about domestic surveillance in public forums while government agencies did something else in private.

THOMAS: Just recently, a federal judge in Washington stated that he believes the data gathering is unconstitutional and could violate the Fourth Amendment protecting against unreasonable searches.

But Snowden's critics say he's unleashed potentially ominous consequences for the country.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Taking a very sensitive classified program that targets foreign persons on foreign lands and putting just enough out there to be dangerous is dangerous to us. It's dangerous to our national security.

THOMAS: The leaks, officials say, have caught the attention of terrorists.

(on camera): Are we less safe because of what Snowden took?

KING: Yes, we are. We know that already that certain al Qaeda elements have changed their means of communication based upon what Snowden has disclosed. What Snowden has done has unraveled a significant part of the defenses that we had set up after September 11th, and not just defense, but also some of our preemptive abilities to stop something before it happens.

THOMAS (voice-over): As for the diplomatic damage, enormous. Authorities say for hostile intelligence agencies, the leaks are a bonanza. For friendly nations, the revelations of spying on allies are, as one intelligence official put it, ""a foreign diplomatic disaster.""

STEPHANOPOULOS: It's the latest bombshell from Edward Snowden. There you see President Obama looking relaxed with other world leaders at the G8 summit today, only after hours ""The Guardian"" revealed that America had spied on its own allies.

THOMAS: Embarrassing disclosures that the U.S. was monitoring the phone calls of 35 foreign leaders, close allies among them, including German Prime Minister Angela Merkel.

The leaders demanded answers, with the European Union even sending a fact-finding delegation to Washington.

In protest, Brazil's prime minister canceled a visit, foregoing the pageantry of a state dinner, all forcing the president to engage in full-on diplomatic damage control. And the damage is far from over.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Should we be expecting more revelations from you?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You should.

THOMAS: ""The Guardian's"" editor recently testified before parliament that only a tiny fraction of the leaked files have been revealed.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's about 1 percent of what we were given.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Only 1 percent of the information in those files has now gone public?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.

THOMAS: WikiLeaks, the whistleblower organization which has leaked some of the most explosive secrets of the U.S. government, has supported Snowden throughout. Its leader says there's no turning back.

JULIAN ASSANGE, FOUNDER, WIKILEAKS: Look, there is no stopping the publishing process at this staged. Great care has been taken to make sure that Mr. Snowden can't be pressured by any state to stop the publication process.

GEN. KEITH ALEXANDER, DIRECTOR, NSA: I wish there was a way to prevent it. We don't know how to stop it.

OBAMA: I continue to be concerned about the other documents that he may have. That's part of the reason why we'd like to have Mr. Snowden in custody.

THOMAS: Snowden, charged with espionage and theft, is now a fugitive from justice. He managed to stay a step ahead of authorities, escaping from Hong Kong to Russia, where for (AUDIO GAP) he was stuck in limbo in the Moscow airport before being granted asylum. While it remains unclear whether Snowden will ever face justice in the U.S., his actions may lead to sweeping changes in what the government shares about its most sensitive spy programs.

In late December, a White House review panel recommended greater transparency.

RICHARD CLARKE, MEMBER, WHITE HOUSE NSA ADVISORY PANEL: It's not just the facts that matter here, it's the appearance. The facts are NSA is not reading our e-mails or abusing its power. The appearance, however, is that they are. And we need to end any mistrust by opening it up.

THOMAS: Even the president, while still critical of Snowden, acknowledges the disclosures ignited a legitimate debate.

OBAMA: Just because we can do something doesn't mean we necessarily should. And the values that we've got as Americans are ones that we have to be willing to apply beyond our borders.

THOMAS: And with many more potential leaks to come, the debate is far from over.

For THIS WEEK, Pierre Thomas, ABC News, Washington.

MARY MATALIN: My game-changer this year, and I suspect many more years to come, is Pope Francis, who's building on the teachings of his predecessors, Benedict and John Paul, to show us the way of faith, show us how to walk the walk.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONNA BRAZILE: Senate women were the game-changer this year. They proved that you can put aside partisanship in order to get things done through partnership.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: We have a fresh look at Pope Francis right after this. More of our THIS WEEK game-changers.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(MUSIC PLAYING)

NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Edie Windsor is my game changer; she took her case of injustice all of the way to the Supreme Court. And when she won, she changed the game in terms of marriage equality and ending discrimination in America.

SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: My pick for game changer is the pope and it's an easy one, when he said that the Catholic Church should be a home for all, I think he meant that we should be focusing on issues of bringing people together, not on issues that divide people. I think our country should be doing the same.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: There's never been a Pope Francis before, from the moment he stepped on St. Peter's balcony as the first pope from Latin America, it began to dawn on all of us that this was just the start of dramatic change. Francis is sending a spiritual jolt to the world's billion Catholics, spreading joy and teaching lessons with a caring smile, a simple life, his sense of time, place and history impeccable.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): It is white smoke. There is a pope. A new pope for the 1.2 billion Catholics around the world.

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): That historic moment, a centuries- old tradition, but this year, a surprise.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): Here it comes, let us listen, let us watch.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking Italian).

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): From Argentina.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): The first Jesuit pope.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): That is really something.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): We're really breaking ground here, these cardinals, someone from Latin America who's a Jesuit. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): He's taking the name St. Francis for the first time, which is clearly a signal that he wants to show a different face of the church, face of the poor.

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): His first words were casual, conversational.

POPE FRANCIS: Buona sera.

(APPLAUSE)

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): The first sign of a new day at the Vatican.

FRANCIS (through translator): I would like to give a blessing, but first, do me a favor --

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): That favor: a pope asking the people to pray for him.

COKIE ROBERTS, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It was an incredible moment, because we all had our list of papabile (ph), the people who were likely to be pope. And he wasn't on any of them.

Suddenly here's this Argentinean who was really of a completely different mold. And it signaled that the College of Cardinals had come to a decision that they really wanted a different kind of pope.

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): With that first humble greeting, Pope Francis captured hearts. Down in the crowds, reaching out to those most in need, living simply. He's leading by example and enlivening his church.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think he's working very honestly and simply to transmit his humility to the world.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think he's very true to what the church stands for, but I think he's much more in touch with the fact that, yes, you have to take the message out to people and actually live it.

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): Less than a year after the sudden resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, Pope Francis has shifted focus from the scandals of the past to a future centered on the poor.

CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN: We have not had a good run of late. And what I have tried to say, George, is this pope has successfully, finally shattered the caricature of the church that his predecessors have tried hard to do.

What's that caricature? That the church is kind of mean and dour and always saying no and always telling us what we can't do and always telling us why we should be excluded. He's saying, no, come on in, the church is about warmth and tenderness.

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): In an ABC News/Washington Post poll, 92 percent of American Catholics think well of the pope. And 85 percent think he's moving the church in the right direction.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York sees the Francis effect first- hand.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But you all really have seen the kind of impact this man would have?

DOLAN: No. I think nothing that he's does has surprised us. But what surprised us is that he's done it even more effectively than we thought. What we were after was a good pastor with a track record of solid administration but fatherly warm, tender care for the sheep, for his people. And, boy, we got that on steroids with Pope Francis. He's the world's parish priest.

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): Drawing in the young with a sense of humor and laid-back style, on his travels, Pope Francis is a rock star, speaking out in new ways.

FRANCIS: In the worlds of politics, business, art and social media.

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): And downplaying what he calls the church's obsession with social issues.

STEPHANOPOULOS: He seems to want to rebalance in some ways. He says, of course, he holds to the church doctrine on things like abortion and gay marriage. But he says also, let's not just talk about this (INAUDIBLE).

DOLAN: Yes, you know what? John XXIII said, look, the teaching of the church is a timeless gift, you can't change it, it's ours, we inherited it, we're given it.

But the way we gift wrap it, the way we make it more attractive and more compelling to the world, that could always change and that's what Francis is saying.

ROBERTS: Pope Francis is emphasizing different parts of church doctrine. So, he's talking about income inequality and the need for the church to be the church for the poor.

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): In his first exhortation outlining his vision for the church, Pope Francis took on capitalism, denouncing the idolatry of money and an economy that kills.

DOLAN: What he says is that the dollar is money, if the economy becomes our God, that's idolatry. There's only one God and money ain't it, OK? Money is morally neutral. It's how we use it that makes it sinful or good. And so he said use it for the good to support yourself and your family, to reinvest in society and to help those without. Don't let it become the be-all and end-all of life.

STEPHANOPOULOS: He's not the first pope to speak like this, but it's also drawn some criticism from some.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is just pure Marxism coming out of the mouth of the pope. There's no such unfettered capitalism that doesn't exist anywhere.

DOLAN: You get it from both sides. And sometimes, criticism is good, Jesus said, be careful if the world is only saying good things about you. So Pope Francis probably shrugs and says, well, it's good that I'm upsetting some people. It's good that people are taking me seriously. And he'll get it again. He knows that.

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): Not shying away, responding to critics, challenging them with questions of his own.

ARCHBISHOP JOSEPH KURTZ, U.S. CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS: He's not asking us to change the teachings of our church. He takes very seriously his responsibility to pass on the sacred traditions. But he is saying let's not get so pigeonholed that we're involved in a kind of an intellectual debate.

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): Archbishop Joseph Kurtz is the new head of U.S. Bishops.

KURTZ: He's giving us a new zeal, he's giving us new expressions and a new method. He's saying the same time-honored, beautiful message of Christ, but in a way that's really touching hearts.

STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): An age-old message delivered in a modern way, by ""Time"" magazine's Person of the Year.

DOLAN: He said, ""'Time' magazine? I'm more worried about timeless things."" OK? So that's the way he is. He shrugs and says, well, thanks. Who cares?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): He doesn't want to be the center of attention. He wants others to be the center. And gosh, that's a great Francis effect, isn't it?

(END VIDEOTAPE)

STEPHANOPOULOS: And when the pope said those words, ""Who am I to judge when asked about gay priests?"" It really signaled a sea change for many in the church's attitude toward acceptance of gays. (INAUDIBLE) landmark year for gay rights, so much change, kept a Supreme Court's historic sanctioning of gay marriage.

Here's ABC's David Wright.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DAVID WRIGHT, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): From the highest court in the land --

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tonight, landmark ruling. The Supreme Court redefines the modern American family.

WRIGHT (voice-over): -- to the most competitive court in the land.

STEPHANOPOULOS: You always knew you were gay? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. It's -- I sort of describe it as you know that the sky is blue but you keep telling yourself that it's red.

WRIGHT (voice-over): 2013 was a game changer. From the church and its new, more accepting pope and state after state after state legalizing gay marriage, 2013 broke the rainbow ceiling, the biggest year for gay and lesbian rights since the Stonewall riots 30 years ago.

WRIGHT: This has been a good year for the gay and lesbian community.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, it has. It's funny to me because I've just come out and I'm kind of on the other side.

There it is.

WRIGHT (voice-over): Soccer star Robbie Rogers of the L.A. Galaxy is living that change in real time. Earlier this year, he posted a courageous personal note to his blog and became the first professional soccer player in history to tell his fans that he was gay.

ROGERS: Yes, I was really, really nervous. And then instantly after I sent it, I felt so much lighter.

WRIGHT (voice-over): Plenty of other professional athletes have come out after they had already left their respective sports.

But active players, still in their prime, openly gay? Unheard of in American sports. At least on a professional level, until this year. Not only did Rogers come in, so did veteran NBA center Jason Collins, who sat down with George.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Martina Navratilova said that this is going to save some kids' lives.

COLLINS: You know, I look at her as one of my heroes. Hopefully going forward, I can be someone else's role model.

WRIGHT (voice-over): Collins made the cover of ""Sports Illustrated,"" where he disclosed that he chose the number 98 to honor Matthew Shepard, a young gay man murdered in 1998 in a hate crime.

STEPHANOPOULOS: What do you say to the 12-year-old boy who's out there practicing right now, wants to be a pro ballplayer and happens to be gay?

COLLINS: It doesn't matter that you're gay, but the key thing is that it's about basketball.

WRIGHT: Pro sports is of course high pressure, high profile, almost stereotypically manly, but so is another realm of American life that saw a huge shift in attitudes in 2013, the U.S. military, having already dropped its longstanding ban on gay and lesbian service, this year it extended full benefits to same-sex spouses. Astonishingly, the U.S. military is now more open than U.S. professional sports.

If the military can change, surely the locker room can change.

ROGERS: Yeah, you would think so.

WRIGHT: For the armed services, that final shift toward full acceptance of gays and lesbians, came as an immediate consequence of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling this year in a landmark case brought by Edie Windsor who spoke with Diane Sawyer.

SAWYER: When you see the words, though, Edie Windsor versus the United States of America...

EDIE WINDSOR, ACLU: When I first saw it, I was terrified. I was just -- I thought what have I done? And then I gradually understood that the government wasn't going to be personally mad at me.

WRIGHT: Windsor and her partner of 42 years got married in Canada in 2007 and sued to have their marriage recognized in their own country. It took the U.S. Supreme Court to make it happen.

SAWYER: When you heard the news, what did you do?

WINDSOR: Cried. First thing, OK. And the room was full of people, so we were both screaming and crying at the same time.

WRIGHT: Sadly, her wife Thea Spyer did not live to see it.

SAWYER: Do you think about what you would like to say to her today?

WINDSOR: I know that you're stunned, OK. It's really just -- I know what she would say, she would say you did it, honey.

WRIGHT: The latest ABC News polling data finds that support for gay marriage is at an all-time high. 58 percent of Americans now say it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to wed.

Ironically, one of the biggest financial backers of the minority view, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to anti-gay causes is Robbie Rogers new boss, the owner of the LA Galaxy, billionaire Philip Anschutz.

Has he said anything to you?

ROGERS: No.

WRIGHT: No conversations at all.

ROGERS: No conversation at all.

WRIGHT: Rogers says his fans and his family have been every bit as accepting as he could have hoped.

ROGERS: They were supportive from the minute I told them. Everything that happens was the exact opposite of what I thought would happen. You know, I come from a very Catholic, conservative family. And I can tell you they've never, ever voted liberal or Democrat in their lives.

WRIGHT: He says there have been a few abusive remarks from the sidelines, but mostly from fans of rival teams.

ROGERS: Just like -- like fag or stuff like that. But it's usually when we're winning.

WRIGHT: So we're not talking Jackie Robinson abuse?

ROGERS: No. No. And I don't like when people compare Jason Collins or I to him, because people wanted to kill him. And you know, there's just people that don't agree with us.

WRIGHT: The place he was most worried about -- the locker room.

So any awkward moments in the locker room at all?

ROGERS: For the most part, no, especially in our locker room. The guys are very respectful. And we make jokes.

WRIGHT: What kind of jokes?

ROGERS: Well, like, guys will like I'm the first person they come to for fashion advice. And I'm just like, come on, are you serious?

WRIGHT: Rogers' experience is in keeping with other high-profile Americans whose highly personal decision this year to come out hasn't made their careers miss a beat.

So there are about 6,000 professional athletes in this country, exactly two of whom are out, you and Jason Collins, what do you suspect the real number is?

ROGERS: I have no clue. Not one has reached out to me. You know, Jason and I are friends, we talk all the time, but besides that I haven't spoken to any -- any other athletes that are closeted.

WRIGHT: No one has reached out to you?

ROGERS: No one.

Again, I have...

WRIGHT: No one has quietly said, hey, keep it a secret, but...

ROGERS: No, no. And I've had like thousands and thousands of e- mails and letters and everything, from people from everywhere, everywhere around the world -- or the world. so...

WRIGHT: It's amazing.

ROGERS: Yeah, nothing.

WRIGHT: He's hoping his example will make a difference.

For This Week, David Wright, ABC News, Los Angeles.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

STEPHANOPOULOS: It already has.

And coming up, more of our special edition This Week game changers, including the teenager nominated for a Nobel peace prize in 2013 Malala up next.

But first, more of our This Week regulars and their game changers.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, (D) NEW YORK: My game changer of the year is Malala Yousafzai, because she told up to the Taliban, she withstood their attack. And she's still fighting for equality for all in Pakistan. She is standing up to make sure every young girl in her country has the right to an education. She's my game changer of the year.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: When we come back, the teenage girl who stared down the Taliban. That's up next in our special edition This Week game changers.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MATTHEW DOWD, POLITICAL CONSULTANT: My pick for game changer this year is Miles Scott, of Batkid fame in San Francisco. Here's a 5-year-old who recovered from leukemia, got a wish from Make a Wish Foundation. He wanted to become a super hero. And when the country is in dire need of superheroes, we found one in a 5-year-old and drew the attention of the country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: This morning, we are looking back at the game changers of 2013. The next, a Pakistani teenager who cheated death to become an inspiring global star. Malala Yousafzai refused to back down to threats from the Taliban. They shot her in the head, but she refused to die. And this year became the youngest person ever nominated for the Nobel peace prize.

ABC's Bob Woodruff has her amazing story still in its first chapter.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BOB WOODRUFF, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: We first met 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai in Birmingham, England just three months after the Taliban tried to kill her. She had returned home from the hospital between surgeries and spoke to ABC News for the first time since the attack.

YOUSAFZAI: Dear Malala, I heard what happened to you on October 9.

WOODRUFF: Her home was filled with letters and presents from around the world.

(on camera): You must have a lot of people that you want to thank.

What would you say to them?

M. YOUSAFZAI: Today, you can see that I am alive. I can see. I can see you. I can see everyone. And I'm getting better day by day.

WOODRUFF (voice-over): It was a miracle she had survived at all -- shot in the head at point blank range. This little girl from the Swat Valley of Pakistan was not only fighting for her life, she was fighting for the right of all girls to go to school.

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Malala Yousafzai was attacked and shot by extremists who don't want girls to have an education and don't want girls to speak for themselves.

M. YOUSAFZAI: I have the right to an education. I have the right to play. I have the right to speak up.

WOODRUFF: Malala was speaking up because Taliban was bombing schools, threatening teachers and ordering girls to stay at home.

(VIDEO CLIP)

WOODRUFF: She was even featured in this documentary by the ""New York Times.""

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

M. YOUSAFZAI: They cannot stop me. I will get my education if it is in home, schools or any place.

I want to become a doctor.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WOODRUFF: Her father, Ziauddin, an activist and school teacher, was targeted for death. Soon, his only daughter would be, too. She doesn't remember the man with a gun boarding her school bus, but she described what her friends sitting next to her told her in this interview with Diane Sawyer. M. YOUSAFZAI: He said, you were just holding my hand and you just squeezed my hand like you were just forcing it. And you said nothing. And she said, like you just look at -- looked at the man like this. And then she said like, then he fired three -- three bullets and one hit you on the left side of my head. And it hit me like this. So I hide my face, because there was gun powder on my finger.

WOODRUFF: The alleged shooter, Atta Ullah, was never arrested. As word spread that Malala was alive, her survival became the ultimate defiance.

(on camera): Malala has become a hero. She has now triggered a huge movement around the world. She gets letters from children.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Malala is incredible.

WOODRUFF: They have made videos for her.

(VIDEO CLIP)

WOODRUFF: Did you ever imagine that there would be this kind of reaction to what happened to her?

ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: I think Malala is an inspiration for the children all over the world. Every girl is like Malala Yousafzai.

WOODRUFF (voice-over): But not every girl would risk her life to take on the extremists who tried to kill her.

SHIZA SHAHID, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE MALALA FUND: I was with her only a couple of days after the incident. And I asked her, what do you want to do?

And she said, I want to continue doing the work that I'm doing.

And I said, sweetheart, you need to rest right now.

And she said, but I'm OK and I'm going to be OK and there is many, many more people that I need to help.

WOODRUFF: She could have disappeared. She could have silenced herself. This is pretty courageous of her, to do this kind of work.

SHAHID: She will not back down until she thinks every child has the right to go to school.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM JULY 12, 2013)

M. YOUSAFZAI: I'm here to speak up for the right of education of every child.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WOODRUFF: So on her 16th birthday, the bravest girl in the world took to the stage at the United Nations, an emotional moment for her proud parents.

M. YOUSAFZAI: They thought that the bullet would silence us. But they failed. The terrorists thought that they would change my aims and stop my ambitions. But nothing changed in my life, except this. Weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born.

WOODRUFF: The little girl from Swat has become a symbol for a cause much larger than herself.

Z. YOUSAFZAI: Her life is a miracle. Her standing up again with her full stature is a miracle. And the way she spoke, I think it was amazing. And now, I'm not the only person who own her as a daughter. She's owned by everybody.

WOODRUFF (on camera): She's the daughter of the world?

Z. YOUSAFZAI: She's the daughter of the world. And she wants an education for everybody, especially for the daughters and sons of Taliban.

WOODRUFF (voice-over): But on the one year anniversary of Malala's attack, the Taliban said they would target her again.

M. YOUSAFZAI: I think life is always dangerous. Some people get afraid of it and people don't go forward. And now I know that you must not be afraid of it and you must move forward.

WOODRUFF: To move forward, she has created The Malala Fund, to raise awareness and money for the 32 million girls around the world who can't go to school. Her first grant, sending 40 young girls working in domestic labor in the Swat Valley to school full-time.

M. YOUSAFZAI: Let us turn the education of 40 girls into 40 million girls.

WOODRUFF: Many of the world's loudest voices are speaking out to support her cause.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They shot her at point blank range in the head and made her stronger.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Malala, who dared to believe that every child has an equal right to an education.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What matters is if you are brave. And you are very, very brave, Malala.

(VIDEO CLIP, COURTESY ""THE DAILY SHOW"")

JON STEWART, HOST: I know your father is backstage and he's very proud of you.

But would he be mad if I adopted you?

(END VIDEO CLIP) WOODRUFF: Despite her popularity, Malala continues to speak truth to power. When President Barack Obama invited her to the White House, she expressed concern about the innocent victims killed by American drone attacks and asked him to refocus on education.

M. YOUSAFZAI: One child, one teacher, one book and one pen can change the world.

WOODRUFF: For THIS WEEK, I'm Bob Woodruff, ABC News, New York.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Malala just announced her new goal and she wants to be prime minister of Pakistan. And she's already written a memoir called ""I am Malala.""

And up next, Boston strong -- how a city inspired all of us.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. KEITH ELLISON (D), MINNESOTA: My game-changers are low wage service workers who are striking all over this country for a better wage for themselves and their families. They're not waiting on Congress to change the law, they're taking their lives into their own hands.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JAMES CARVILLE: My game-changer of the year is John Kerry. Any time you have a chance to alter a strategic map that's been in existence for 60 years, that's a big game-changer.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. TOM COLE (R), OKLAHOMA: My game-changers for 2013 are Representative Paul Ryan and Senator Patty Murphy.

Why?

Because they reached across the aisle. They came up with a deal for the first time in a long time and got Washington working again.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Our next game-changer, an entire city. 2013 started out tough for Boston. That deadly attack on the city's legendary marathon shut Boston down. It shocked us all. It was a hard shot.

But Boston came back strong and capped the year with some Red Sox pride.

Here's ABC's John Donvan.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOHN DONVAN, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was the week a fallen runner got the cover of ""Sports Illustrated"" along with the terror and the turmoil and the response, because that's what it started out as that morning, while the innocence still held, a sports story, one of the biggest and oldest and proudest of its kind.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the battle for second is on.

DONVAN: Bearing the name of the city that has hosted its since forever.

Then to have this break it apart.

And with three people killed, one of them a kid, and many more badly wounded, the sports story became the worst kind of news story.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Get out of here!

DONVAN (voice-over): That left a hurt in everyone.

MAYOR TOM MENINO (D), BOSTON: This marathon bombing, in fact, I feel like I've never, ever seen before, the violation of their privacy, of their enjoyment.

DONVAN: Did you take it as a personal wound?

MENINO: I didn't take it personally but I was hurt by it.

DONVAN (voice-over): But what Mayor Tom Menino did notice that week as he ran a city under lockdown and in the midst of a manhunt was how sports became a vocabulary used to address the hurt, how the Chicago press used the simplest of headlines to say, we're with you, Boston.

How the New York Yankees did the same with their rendition of ""Sweet Caroline,"" the song that belongs to the Boston Red Sort of. And speaking of those Red Sox, well, in two great acts, they gave something back to their battered city.

Act one started with their first home stand at the end of that terrible week, a pregame tribute to Boston itself, its people, its heroes, a celebration some other towns might have held in a church or a cathedral or on the town square.

DONVAN: In Boston, everybody else also looked at Fenway Park and turned to Fenway Park in this terrible moment that had become a triumphant moment and to find hope. Why in this city do people go to a baseball stadium --

(CROSSTALK)

MENINO: We love our Red Sox.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): It's true, look at the crowd that day. It's always true. For a lot of people from Boston, being a Red Sox fan is their main way of saying that they're from Boston.

MENINO: It was very moving. Yes, it was very moving, the first responders there.

DAVID ORTIZ, RED SOX: We want to thank you, Mayor Menino.

DONVAN (voice-over): And then they gave the mike to David Ortiz and what he said was a little moving and a little shocking.

ORTIZ: This is our (INAUDIBLE) city and nobody can going to take it away, stay strong. Thank you.

DONVAN (voice-over): Act one also saw the Red Sox throughout their season making hospital visits and bringing survivors to games to throw out the first pitch. And most of all, acknowledging from that ceremony on, that this 2013 season was going to mean something different.

WILL MIDDLEBROOKS, BOSTON RED SOX: It'll take a lot of responsibility. We know how big of a deal baseball is here. We know how passionate everyone is about it. And we're just happy to get back out there and help the city heal.

JARROD SALTALAMACCHIA, BOSTON RED SOX: I think that's what we're here for, you know, there's a duty just like everyone else to come together. And that's what we're going to do.

JONNY GOMES, BOSTON RED SOX: You do want to be saddened for a second and celebrate their lives, but at the same time, I guess the American way, we got to continue to keep, you know, keep chugging and not let that act slow us down, but at the same time, we do have to take a deep breath and acknowledge what did happen.

DONVAN (voice-over): Act two, of course, was how they played this 2013 season. They had been awful in 2012 and not much better in the early days of 2013.

DONVAN: The early part of the season, you were at those games and they weren't playing very well. What were you thinking?

MENINO: I was agonizing a little bit about it. But I always said, they would get back.

DONVAN (voice-over): Well, yes, they did, all of the way to the playoffs. Then the division title. Then the pennant and then they won the World Series.

ORTIZ: First of all, I want to say, this is for you, Boston!

(APPLAUSE)

ORTIZ: (INAUDIBLE). We have been through a lot this year and this is for all of you and all the families that struggled with the bombing this year. This is for all of you.

MENINO: They helped the city get back on its feet. They had a real determination, this team.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 2013 World Champions!

DONVAN (voice-over): And on the day of the victory parade it was the Sox themselves who stopped at the Boston Marathon finish line where they placed their Series trophy just to let it sit there a while, to let it sink in. They had won. Boston had won.

In a vocabulary that came from sports, yes, this was their bleeping town, it always had been. For THIS WEEK, John Donvan, ABC News, Boston.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Love hearing that song again. Thanks to John Donvan for that. And thanks all of you for sharing part of your Sunday with us today and all year long.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/76-year-brooklyn-woman-latest-knockout-game-assault/story?id=21058636,"Police are on the hunt for a man who sucker-punched a 76-year-old New York woman in East New York.

Yvonne Small was attacked from behind at around 11:35 a.m. on Friday while walking on Alabama Avenue, and is believed to be the latest victim in the sometimes deadly ""knockout game,"" police say.

The attack occurred shortly after a nearby rally held by activists condemning the violent ""game"" ended. A male suspect fled the scene and Small was taken to Brookdale Hospital, where she was treated for a head injury and later released.

According to the New York Police Department, there have been at least nine other attacks in the city linked to the knockout game, in which perpetrators pummel innocent, unsuspecting victims, hoping to render them unconscious with one punch.

On Nov. 22, police charged one man for punching a 24-year-old Jewish man. In response to that attack in Brooklyn, New York City Councilman David Greenfield told ABC station WABC-TV in New York that officials should send a message of ""zero tolerance.""

""That's why I called on the NYPD and District Attorney's Office to literally throw the book at these individuals and to charge them with many crimes, including hate crimes and gang assault, because that's what it is,"" Greenfield said.

Police said there have seven other similar attacks in Brooklyn and believe the motive may be related to anti-Semitism. The NYPD's hate crimes task force is investigating the cases. It was not clear whether the latest victim, Small, is Jewish like all of the nine other victims before her.

Republican state Assemblyman Jim Tedisco has proposed a bill that would classify knockout game attacks as gang assaults, and would require that youths who participate in such attacks be tried as adults, facing prison terms of up to 25 years.

""These twisted and cowardly thugs are preying on innocent bystanders and they don't care if the victims are young, old, a man or woman,"" Tedisco told The Associated Press when he announced the bill. ""Life isn't a video game. These are real people whose lives are not only being put in jeopardy but in many cases destroyed.""

But despite increased police crackdowns on the alleged perpetrators, the dangerous game appears to be spreading further throughout the country.

One unidentified Denver man told ABC News affiliate KMGH-TV in Denver that he was sucker-punched when leaving a bar, which would make him one of the first people in that city to be a victim of the ""knockout"" game.

In Washington, two people were randomly punched in separate incidents but suffered only minor injuries and did not lose consciousness, while two similar assaults in Philadelphia also have police on alert.

In September, Ralph Santiago, 46, of Hoboken, N.J., died from injuries resulting from a suspected knockout attack that sent him careering backward into a fence, where his head got lodged. Three teens -- two 13-year-olds and a 14-year-old -- have been charged with murder.

In late May, two teenagers admitted to fatally beating and killing a man in Syracuse, N.Y. They admitted that the attack began with the intention of knocking out the victim, Michael Daniels, with a single blow. Both teens, 16 and 13, were sentenced to 18 months in jail.

And earlier in May, Elex Murphy, now 20, was sentenced to life in prison plus 25 years in St. Louis for killing a Vietnamese immigrant as part the game in 2011.

Surveillance footage has also gone viral of another attack from 2012, in which a 50-year-old Pittsburgh, Pa., English teacher named James Addlespurger is struck and falls limply to the curb.

Experts say the violent acts appear to be driven in part by a pack mentality and peer pressure put on the perpetrators.

""These kids have effectively de-humanized others,"" Former FBI special agent Brad Garrett told ABC News. ""They are being drastically influenced by the groups to commit the acts.""

""This I believe is a real economic issue where those who have nothing feel that they have nothing to lose,"" said Dr. Jeff Gardere, a psychologist and assistant professor at Touro Graduate School of Psychology in New York City.

""Not only do they get a thrill out of doing something so horrific but then they get to watch it,"" Gardere said. ""Then they get the positive reinforcement of people just watching these videos and these videos, no pun intended, getting hit after hit after hit after hit and these kids are finding some sort of immortality by their bad behavior.""

http://abcnews.go.com/US/punching-attacks-states-investigated-links-knockout-game/story?id=21011088,"A 16-year-old girl in London was cold-clocked by stranger in broad daylight. In Manchester, England, a man died after being punched at a bus stop. A 78-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were both punched in the head in separate attacks in Brooklyn.

Some law enforcement officials believe these attacks are part of a disturbing trend known as ""The Knockout Game,"" in which perpetrators pummel innocent, unsuspecting victims. Incidents have been reported in England and in several states in the United States.

There have been at least two deaths from similar attacks this year. Surveillance video of teenagers in New Jersey shows the group running away after punching a man who then had a seizure and died.

James Addelspurger, a 51-year-old English teacher at a creative arts high school in Pittsburgh and a popular local blues musician, was walking home one afternoon after work last year when he was attacked.

""I walked home through that alley for years, picked up a newspaper from the rack on the street, reading an article, put it through my arm, proceeded to walk through the alley, next thing I know, I was waking up answering questions to a police officer,"" he said.

Addelspurger said he has no memory of the incident, but the attack was captured on surveillance footage, which showed a passing 15-year-old boy punching Addelspurger, who fell hard and smashed his face on the concrete.

""That was a violent senseless act but I didn't know what happened until I saw the film,"" Addelspurger said. ""I was in pain, I was confused, I was bloody.""

Addelspurger said the incident made him angry.

""My initial anger from that, had no issues with anything, love teaching, teaching kids music, lover of life, lover of literature but when that occurred it was very senseless, very confusing, questioned humanity, the trust in people and so forth,"" he said. ""But I do believe people are intrinsically good.""

The worst part, he said, was seeing the 15-year-old and his friends on tape laughing at Addelspurger and then leaving him for dead.

For the first time, the young man who attacked Addelspurger talked about that day. He spoke to ""Nightline"" exclusively, but did not want his name identified or face shown. The now 16-year-old said the attack was ""an impulse of stupidity, trying to show off for my friends.""

""It was just like, 'let me knock this guy out, let me hit him,' basically like showing off to let them know I could fight,"" he said. ""I feel guilty and embarrassed, ashamed.""

The young man insists he had never heard of the knockout game when he attacked Addelspurger last year, but in recent days and weeks, there has been a spike of these kinds of attacks, which authorities believe may, in fact, be part of the game.

""Violence for us now is as American as apple pie,"" said Dr. Jeff Gardere, a psychologist and assistant professor at Touro Graduate School of Psychology in New York City. ""We've become desensitized to it and there are some individuals who may not have a large menu of exposure to the arts to science to music all they're getting is the violence and they react to that.""

In Washington, D.C., this month, Phoebe Connolly, who works with teenagers professionally, was punched in the face while riding her bike.

""Are they going to take somebody's money, are they going to take their cell phone? No, they're just going to knock you out? There's just no purpose for it whatsoever,"" she told ABC affiliate WJLA.

Last Friday in New York City, police charged one man for punching a 24-year-old Jewish man. Police said there have seven other similar attacks in Brooklyn and believe the motive may be related to anti-Semitism. All eight victims, including the 78-year-old woman, were Jewish and the NYPD's hate crimes task force is investigating.

""This I believe is a real economic issue where those who have nothing feel that they have nothing to lose,"" Gardere said. ""Not only do they get a thrill out of doing something so horrific but then they get to watch it and then they get the positive reinforcement of people just watching these videos and these videos, no pun intended, getting hit after hit after hit after hit and these kids are finding some sort of immortality by their bad behavior.""

But in the Addelspurger case in Pittsburgh, the 16-year-old perpetrator said race was not an issue.

""It was nothing,"" he said. ""No matter who walked down that alleyway at that time they would have got hit, I'm just being blunt with you and giving it to you raw.""

Some say the media may be exacerbating the problem by repeatedly showing these videos, but experts said parents can use this as a teachable moment, and talk to their kids about the dangers of not only being victims but also perpetrators.

The young man captured on surveillance tape from Pittsburgh was released a few months ago from a juvenile detention center where he spent nearly a year. He now said he is trying to turn his life around.

""I'm ashamed that I did that, embarrassed that I did that, wish I could take it back. I just felt like I owe him something,"" he said. ""I'm going to feel like I always owe him something for the rest of my life.""

As for other kids who might be tempted to randomly attack someone, the young man said they need to think twice.

""I wish I could take every kid who's doing that and put them what I've been through for a quick second and like they would just like, 'woah, I don't want no part of that,'"" he said. ""I guarantee they wouldn't even think about doing it. ... It's not even just the freedom and the juvie, the fact of knowing that you did that to somebody who didn't deserve it at all.""",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/san-jose-state-university-president-failed-protect-student/story?id=21008011,"The president of San Jose State University took responsibility today for failing to protect a black freshman who was allegedly subjected to racially charged torment by four white roommates.

University President Mohammad Qayoumi said that by failing to ""intervene earlier to stop the abuse, or impose sanctions as soon as the gravity of the behavior became clear, we failed him. I failed him.""

From August until October, prosecutors allege several freshmen at San Jose State University in California taunted their black suitemate with racial epithets, Nazi imagery and on one occasion, clamped a U-shaped bicycle lock around his neck.

""How such abuse could have gone unchecked or undetected for weeks is being methodically untangled, as it must,"" Qayoumi said. ""An independent expert will soon be named to lead a task force that will examine the facts, our policies and practices, and propose reforms.""

NAACP leaders are pushing the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office to upgrade the charges against the white students, including one who is under 18, to felonies.

Misdemeanor battery and hate crime charges were filed against the four students last week. They have also been suspended from school.

Victim Was Physically Afraid of Roommates

The alleged victim was described by a prosecutor as a ""mild-mannered, sweet kid"" who was physically afraid of his roommates and what they would do if he reported the abuse.

The victim ""really wanted to just get along. I think he hoped this would go away, and I think another big part of it was he was physically scared of them,"" Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Erin West told ABCNews.com.

The victim's name has not been released to protect his identity.

""There were mean tricks played on him -- barricading him in his bedroom and putting their hands on him to put this bike lock around his neck,"" West said. ""It seems clear the motivation for that battery was motivated by hate.""

Instead of calling the victim by his name, West said the suspects called him ""Three-Fifths,"" a reference to the fraction used more than a century ago to count slaves for the purpose of congressional representation in the U.S. Census.

When the victim objected, West said they changed the cruel nickname to ""Fraction.""

As the semester progressed, West said the teen spent less time in his suite and instead went home on the weekends to escape the alleged torment.

His parents took him back to the residence hall one weekend in October and saw why.

""They saw the N-word written on a dry erase board in his suite and saw the confederate flag,"" West said.

The parents immediately filed a report with college officials.

San Jose State University spokeswoman Pat Harris told ABCNews.com that an investigation was launched the same day housing staff was made aware of the allegations.

Two suspects were relocated to single rooms elsewhere on campus, while a third suspect, who was initially believed to be a bystander, was removed from the suite on Thursday when he was identified as an offender, Harris said. It was unclear why the fourth student remained in the suite until the end of last week.

Qayoumi said the school should have acted faster to stop the alleged abuse.

""Some anger is being directed toward residence hall advisers (RAs) for failing to recognize or act on warning signs of abuse. It is our job as professional educators to help them recognize these signs. Their failures are our failures,"" he said. ""We must do a better job of training them, and we will.""",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/US/knockout-game-suspect-charged-hate-crime/story?id=20992590,"The Brooklyn, N.Y., man accused of assaulting an Orthodox Jew in what appears to be another case of the knockout game is being charged with a hate crime for the alleged attack.

Amrit Marajh, 28, was charged with harassment as a hate crime after he allegedly punched the 24-year-old Orthodox Jewish man Friday morning.

The unidentified victim believes he was attacked as part of the deadly ""knockout"" game, where an attacker aims to knock out the victim with a single sucker punch, police said.

The violent game has been linked to assault reports in at least six states, and three people have been killed in suspected knockout attacks.

The unidentified Brooklyn victim said he was walking home early Friday morning in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn when he was assaulted and heard his alleged attackers daring each other to punch him out minutes before one actually assaulted him, according to police.

He said there was no question that the game was the motive for the attack, New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly said.

""He makes a statement that he was punched in the side of the face,"" Kelly said. ""He also makes a statement that just prior to it they were talking about the 'Knockout Game'.""

New York City police arrested four men Friday in connection with the alleged sucker-punching. Only Marajh was charged, however, and the other three were released.

Teens in Beating Case Tried as Adults

In response to at least eight attacks in the past few weeks, police have stepped up patrols in several Brooklyn neighborhoods where many Jewish people, the latest New York victim among them, have been the targeted.

Two weeks ago, a 78-year-old Jewish woman in Brooklyn was punched in the face by teens while walking down her street, prompting an investigation by the NYPD Hate Crimes Taskforce and leading a New York lawmaker to call for harsher penalties for so-called knockout game players.

The woman's daughter, who wanted to remain anonymous, told ""Good Morning America"" that she found the violence senseless.

""Someone wanted to inflict pain onto someone else,"" the woman said. ""No other purpose.""

Republican state Assemblyman Jim Tedisco has proposed a bill that would classify the knockout game attacks as gang assaults, and would require that youths who participate in such attacks be tried as adults, facing prison terms of up to 25 years.

http://abcnews.go.com/Health/german-law-parents-intersex-kids-pick-gender-undetermined/story?id=20752191,"On Nov. 1, Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia. No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.

The new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender ""undetermined"" or ""unspecified"" on their birth certificates.

The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.

One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, ""I am neither a man nor a woman. I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.""

Canadian parents raise 'genderless' baby.

An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl -- they are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.

Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.

Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.

New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law ""sounds like a good thing.""

Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.

""Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not,"" he said. ""You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops. The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate. ... Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens. It's like the mystery of why people are gay.""

A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as ""differ[ent] from trans [sexual or gender] people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup (genetic, hormonal and physical features), which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.

""These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.""

The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.

Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.

Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a ""third gender"" on their official documents. In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized ""genderless"" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an ""unspecified"" gender status for life.

German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.

In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.

In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for ""gender theory"" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.

The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that ""(a)s the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization.""

One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.

""Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child,"" she told the parenting website. ""Children need stability and certainty.""

Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality. And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.

But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.

""Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'"" said Drescher. ""When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.""

The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable. He argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person thought of themselves as male or female.

But in one 1966 case, known as ""John/Joan,"" his theories became controversial. He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.

""Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not,"" said Drescher. ""When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman. But at 38, he committed suicide.""

Drescher said that now some doctors are still ""practicing that model."" But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward ""not happy with the outcome.""

Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals. Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a ""satisfactory life"" as a man.

So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl. He was given female hormones at age 12.

""I knew that I wasn't a girl,"" he said. ""I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.""

At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty. But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records. What he found out was horrifying. ""I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.""

Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals. After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed. Surgery rendered him infertile.

Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.

""I think any measure, legal or otherwise, granting a parent of any child more time to carefully consider how best to honor and preserve their child's emotional and physical health is encouraging,"" Bruce wrote in an email to ABCNews.com after the law went into effect.

But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law ""invites labeling and stigma.""

""A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an 'undetermined,'"" she said. ""We are afraid it will encourage intervention. We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting. But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.""

Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because ""it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender.""

""Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,"" she said. ""German law is about assigning it at birth. That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point. When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.""

Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will ""empower"" both parents and children.

Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics. She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries. When she was 6, doctors discovered small testes in a hernia sac.

Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry. Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.

""The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves,"" said Baratz. ""It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.' This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child. You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun. We don't have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.""

""It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing,"" she said. ""Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that's a wonderful thing. It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.""",abcnews.com,True

On October 6 1998. Matthew Sheppard -- student at the University of Wyoming was brutally beaten. Six days later Mathieu passed away as a result of his injuries and the story. -- global attention to hate crimes and sparked more says Kaufman a playwright and director to right. The Laramie project and he is joining us now today to talk about it has been fifteen years. Since that day -- walk we through the process of how you even began writing this. I think when Matthew Shepard was beaten I was obviously sought by the brutality of the crime. He was Stipe to defends. -- with the butt of a gun and then left there. For 24 hours before somebody -- That he spent six days in a hospital in that he passed away. So that was of a brutality to lead this image of these young boy -- to a fans in the middle of low Wyoming prairie. But I think the thing that -- Struck me the most in the days that followed was how much attention was getting. You could open the newspaper without seeing -- to -- -- of the Internet or television radio. And you don't -- that time there were over a thousand anti gay crimes committed in America. Every year and for some reason this wondrous made it this -- was the one where America as a nation took notice. And wouldn't -- me was why what was about this one crime that so clearly became a watershed historical moment. So at that time. What we have a theater company New York of the department theater -- -- connector to the company members of the company and I said. Let's go to Laramie. And let's talk to the people of the town and perhaps we can get. A document that records -- -- Laramie was thinking and feeling at the end of the millennium but how America was thinking and feeling at the end of the millennium. Sold ten of us went to Laramie. And we spent a year back and forth going to Laramie and interviewed. I think don't 200 people. And then from that we wrote the -- the laboratory. And the fact the matter is that it has been fifteen years since that day and how is the Laramie project. Changed in the way that -- received by audiences. Well I think that that the reason as you said well let me project is still one of the most -- -- in the country. Is because it was a snapshot of our culture -- very specific moment in time. On the Laramie project captures. -- war that is going on in America. A war about social justice a war about civil rights. So anybody who comes and sees the Laramie project they will find their point of view represented on stage. We did not only interview people we agreed with we've -- -- people who disagreed with -- we interviewed people who. Believe that they hate crime legislation should be pursued we -- we interview people who thought there should be don't hate crime legislation. We interviewed people who said oh my Matthew -- doing what he was doing he deserve what happened to it we talked to people who were mourning for Matthews. Murder so I think that what has happened over the last fifteen years is that we as a nation have continued to have the conversation. Any no way there has been great progress made. Right the fact that you created something that has been such an influential force. Is it a humbling. Reaction that you have some -- to the way that it has changed. The country and maybe even -- Nash.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/stabbed-soldier-died-dog-friends-mom/story?id=20512982,"Tears welled up in Kimberly Turnipseed's eyes as she stood outside the courtroom in Tacoma, Wash., today where the soldier accused of killing a friend of her daughter, Tevin Geike, who was also a soldier, was facing a first-degree murder charge.

""He died like a dog,"" Turnipseed said. ""I'm the mom -- the group mother -- I consider Tevin Geike my son.""

The fatal stabbing of Geike has raised passions, not only because one soldier is accused of killing another, but because he was white, his alleged killer was black, and the incident began with the shouting of a racial slur directed against Geike and his white companions.

Geike, who was looking forward to a new life out of the Army after serving for three years, was out with two Army friends celebrating early Saturday morning. They were walking down a street in a small suburban community just outside Joint Base Lewis-McChord when a car drove by. Someone in the car shouted, ""White cracker,"" and someone on the street shouted something back, police said.

Geike and his two friends are white. There were four African American soldiers and one Hispanic soldier in the car, police said.

The group in the car had been out drinking, too, and four of them got out and confronted Geike and his friends, according to police.

""There was some trash talk,"" a source familiar with the investigation said.

When one of the soldiers, Cedarium Johnson, realized all of them were active duty Army he called for the others to get back into the car.

They thought it was over, one witness told investigators.

Then, according to police, Jeremiah Hill walked up behind Geike and gave him a ""bear hug."" When the man released Geike, he dropped to the ground, police said.

Soldier Matthew Barnes says he held his friend and called for help. Geike died moments later, stabbed in the heart.

""Where's the outrage?"" Turnipseed said. ""If this had been the other way around -- black victims -- then this would have been a hate crime.""

""If a hate crime had been committed we'd be charging for a hate crime but we don't have any evidence,"" prosecutor Mark Lindquist told ABC News.

Neither the victim nor the suspect had talked to each other during the confrontation, he said.

Hill was charged with first degree murder. Soldiers Ajoni Runnion-Bareford and Cedarium Johnson were charged with rendering criminal assistance.

Hill's bail was set at $2 million during the hearing today in Pierce County Superior Court.

Johnson was released but will be confined to his barracks at Fort Lewis.

Hill had a bandage on his right hand during the court hearing. He injured himself, cutting his hand during the attack when it slipped off the shank of the knife, according to a source familiar with the case. The knife has been recovered. Hill has not given a statement to police.

Two of the five soldiers in the car are cooperating with police.

Hill, from Chicago, joined the Army six months ago, in April.

Geike was assigned to the 16th Aviation Brigade and has served since October 2010. The 16th Aviation Brigade has supported infantry units in both Iraq and Afghanistan. The suspects' unit, the 3rd Stryker Brigade, has had multiple deployments in both Iraq and Afghanistan.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/washington-soldiers-arrested-fatal-stabbing-fellow-soldier/story?id=20496672,"Three active-duty soldiers in Washington state have been arrested and booked for murder in the stabbing death of a fellow soldier, police said today.

After Saturday's stabbing of Tevin Geike, 20, investigators were also looking into whether the fatal attack was also a hate crime, but authorities said today that they do not believe race was a motivating factor. The victim was white and the alleged attackers were African American.

Three suspects, Jeremiah Hill, 23, Cedarium Johnson, 21, and Ajoni Runnion-Bareford, 21, were arrested and booked for Geike's murder, police said.

The victim and the suspects were all active-duty soldiers from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, about 9 miles south of Tacoma. The suspects were all members of a combat infantry unit and the victim was a member of a combat aviation unit, police said.

The arrests were made after a military sergeant called Lakewood detectives on Sunday afternoon to say that he had information on the stabbing death from a soldier who had come to him, police said.

""The soldier had told his sergeant that another solider in his unit, Jeremiah Hill, had asked for first aid for a knife wound on his right hand on Saturday afternoon,"" police said. ""The soldier stated that Hill told him he cut his hand when he stabbed a guy to death over the weekend.""

When the sergeant confronted Hill, he allegedly said he cut himself while chopping vegetables, police said. They took him to a hospital for treatment and he told staff he cut his hand while cutting a parachute cord, police said.

Authorities said they obtained information on two other people involved in the crime and they were brought in for interviews and cooperated with police.

One of the men brought in for questioning admitted that he was in a car with four friends driving on Pacific Highway when words were exchanged between the men in the car and the men that were walking, including Geike, according to police.

""He said they stopped to talk to the victims, but nothing happened once they discovered they were all active-duty soldiers,"" police said in a news release. ""As the suspects were walking back to their car, Hill appeared to 'bear hug' the victim and pushed him to the ground.""

The cooperating soldier told police Hill was covered in blood when he got back in the car and they realized he had stabbed Geike. They allegedly fled the scene and disposed of the knife, police said. The second cooperating soldier corroborated the account, cops said. It was unclear why only two of the four men in the car, other than Hill, were charged.

""It appears from interviewing everyone involved that race was not a motivating factor in this homicide,"" police said. ""The main suspect, Jeremiah Hill, did not make a statement; so it's unknown exactly why he did this.""

Lakewood Police Lt. Chris Lawler said that none of the four men who were in the car with Hill knew what the motive might be when they were interviewed.

""They have no clue,"" Lawler told ABCNews.com today. ""That's the baffling part. Who knows what the motivation was?""

Authorities did not know if the suspects have retained attorneys or have entered pleas. Officials at Joint Base Lewis-McChord did not immediately respond to requests for comment from ABC News.

Glenn Zimmerman, a friend of Geike, said the solider had been celebrating being discharged from the military at a nearby hotel.

""None of this makes and sense,"" Zimmerman told ABC News' Seattle affiliate KOMO-TV. ""We came down here, and he was already dead.""",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/solider-stabbed-death-wash-police-investigate-hate-crime/story?id=20488480,"Police are investigating whether the fatal stabbing of a solider in Lakewood, Wash., was also a hate crime.

Tevin Geike, 20, was walking with two other soldiers when a group of black men in a car shouted a racial comment as they drove by, the Lakewood Police Department told ABC News affiliate KOMO-TV in Seattle.

""One of the soldiers yelled back something about the suspects treating combat soldiers with disrespect,"" Lt. Chris Lawler told KOMO-TV.

Ex-Solider Pleads Not Guilty in DEA Killing Plot

According to reports the verbal confrontation escalated when the car turned around and the men got out and started to fight the soldiers in a parking lot. The men in the car eventually left after realizing the soldiers were combat veterans, according to witnesses.

During the confrontation Geike was stabbed and he fell to the ground after the car left. He died at the scene.

Glenn Zimmerman, a friend of Geike, said the solider had been celebrating being discharged from the military at a nearby hotel.

""None of this makes and sense,"" Zimmerman told KOMO-TV. ""We came down here, and he was already dead in my brother's arms.""

Lawler told KOMO-TV that the initial remark seemed to be derogatory in nature, but it was unclear whether it was related to race or not. However he said investigators were exploring whether the killing should be considered a hate crime.

The suspects were said to be in their 20s and driving a dark blue BMW or Volkswagon sedan with four doors.

""He's going to get caught,"" Lawler said of Geike's attacker. ""Nobody's going to give up until we catch up.""

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/march-washington-obama-legacy-civil-rights-spotlight-anniversary/story?id=20067008,"When Martin Luther King, Jr., shared his dream from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, the president of the United States was not there to bear witness.

John F. Kennedy was skeptical of the March on Washington, choosing to watch the event on TV from inside the White House several blocks away. He later clashed with King over the urgency for legislation to match the march's message of ""jobs and freedom.""

Fifty years later, amid renewed calls for urgency to address racial disparities in America, the nation's first black president Barack Obama will add his voice to the campaign. He is the marquee speaker during Wednesday's anniversary at the same steps where King stood.

Watch the 50th Anniversary of MLK's ""I Have a Dream"" speech LIVE Wednesday 11:30 a.m. ET with Social Soundtracker.

President Obama ""is the Jackie Robinson of the highest political circles, the highest practice of politics in American life,"" said Randall Kennedy, a Harvard University law professor and black historian who clerked for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. ""The fact that he won [the presidency]…is his great contribution to the civil rights movement, and it's a huge contribution.""

Organizers say Obama's historic achievement will be celebrated as a fulfillment of part of King's vision of equality, coming five years to the day when Obama broke the race barrier in presidential politics, accepting the Democratic nomination in Denver.

Yet Obama's emerging legacy on the advancement of King's broader vision is more complicated, some black leaders concede, a mixed bag of achievements that has at times fallen short of the super-human expectations many African-Americans had when he first took office.

Only one in four African-Americans say the situation of black people has improved during Obama's tenure, according to a new Pew Research Center poll. One in five said things have gotten worse. Half of blacks say things are about the same now compared with five years ago, a view shared by as many whites surveyed in the poll.

The findings underscore the stubbornness of socio-economic disparities that have frustrated the African-American community and at times thwarted Obama's attempts to address it.

""What's disturbing is to see that even with a black president -- not necessarily his fault -- but there's still so many things that need to change in this country, we still have a long way to go,"" said Lynn French, a Washington, D.C., native who helped organize the 1963 march.

Unemployment among blacks remains in the double-digits, at 12.6 percent in July, nearly double the rate of whites. The median household income for a typical black family is just 60 percent that of whites – a gap that has grown since 2009. Nearly one in three blacks lived in poverty in 2011, almost double the national average.

While many community leaders recognize these problems as bigger than Obama alone can solve, there is a sense in some corners that he, like Kennedy, has failed to demonstrate a sufficient sense of urgency.

""What allows President Obama to so readily address this 50th anniversary celebration is the fact that King is now a dead martyr,"" wrote prominent black commentator Tavis Smiley in a recent op-ed for USA Today. ""Otherwise, like Kennedy, Obama might also be mired in anguished soul-searching about whether to share the podium with a man who would undoubtedly be espousing uncomfortable and inconvenient truths.""

Other notable black critics question why Obama has not spoken more regularly on race relations, pointing to the only handful of times he has directly addressed the issue and even then seemingly reluctantly. After George Zimmerman was acquitted in the killing of Florida teen Trayvon Martin, Obama did not speak on-camera about the case or ensuing national demonstrations until six days later.

Some skeptics of Obama's commitment to King's dream, including Princeton professor Cornel West, accuse the president of failing to pursue an African-American specific legislative agenda.

Yet, many blacks say the grumblings about Obama, while not insignificant, are on the margins. The president retains overwhelming approval among blacks – 86 percent in the latest Gallup poll, compared with just 36 percent among whites – and he won more than 90 percent of the black vote in two consecutive elections.

""It is important that the president be scrutinized and constructively criticized,"" said Hillary O. Shelton, director of the NAACP Washington bureau and the advocacy group's chief legislative lobbyist.

""We are not delusional. But it's a narrow focus to only look at the data and not recognize that African-Americans are sophisticated enough to recognize what the reality is of changing that condition,"" he said. ""There's a lot to be said for what President Obama has brought.""

Obama Sees 'More Perfect Union'

White House officials argue Obama's legislative accomplishments on civil rights and economic equality are not insignificant, claiming his policies have aimed to lift everyone, especially African-Americans, even if they have not been singled out. Aides point to the Recovery Act dishing out economic stimulus in the recession to Obamacare's expanded health care coverage to new protections under a federal hate crimes law.

Obama has called for an increase in the minimum wage, more funding for early-childhood education programs, and expanded federal aid for historically black colleges and universities.

Still, on nearly every major socio-economic measure, blacks have faced continued headwinds when it comes to catching up with whites.

""The great majority of African-Americans have shown patience, stuck with Obama even through this terrible recession recognizing the real limits within which he has to operate,"" said Kennedy. ""They have bitten their tongue, not out of complacency, but out of a real, mature grasp of the difficulty he had to face.""

In the lead-up to the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, the administration has taken new steps aimed at demonstrating its commitment to advancing civil rights and racial equality.

Attorney General Eric Holder, the nation's first black attorney general, announced an end to stiff federal mandatory sentences for low-level drug offenders, who are disproportionately black. On Friday, his office ramped up efforts to counter a Supreme Court decision on the Voting Rights Act that activists say undermined rights of minorities. The administration filed suit against a voter ID law in Texas and is eyeing a challenge to a similar law in North Carolina.

""Why so long?"" questioned Smiley on the move to curb automatic sentences five years into Obama's presidency. ""Better, but not nearly good enough""

""There been more action on these fronts than I had thought there would be,"" said Kennedy. ""But you want to see the follow through and the fine print.""

In many ways, Obama's legacy on sustaining King's vision can be summed up in his own words – words he laid out in 2008 with his first major, national speech on race, and words he repeated in his recent remarks on Trayvon Martin.

""We're becoming a more perfect union,"" Obama said. ""Not a perfect union, but a more perfect union.""",abcnews.com,True

Nettles was attacked in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan last weekend. She slipped into a coma after the attack and was taken off life support on Thursday.

Nettles' mother Delores Nettles told ABC station WABC-TV, that before the attack a group of men surrounded the 21-year-old and called her derogatory names including ""he-shes"" and ""she-males.""

Paris Wilson, 20, was arrested at the scene of the crime on a charge of assault, but could face additional charges. The case was turned over to the New York City Hate Crimes Task Force as a possible bias crime after investigators were made aware of the reported insults.

There has been a significant increase in reported bias crimes in New York City this year, with 68 alleged crimes reported so far this year. In 2012 there were a total of 54 reported attacks.

According to The Associated Press, detectives were investigating whether Wilson had propositioned Nettles before the attack.

Delores Nettles told WABC-TV she hoped additional charges would be brought against Islan's alleged assailants.

http://abcnews.go.com/Health/germany-offers-legal-gender-intersex-kids-undetermined/story?id=20029285,"Germany is soon to be the first European nation to legally recognize a third gender in cases of babies born with ambiguous genitalia. No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned male or female.

The law, designed to fight discrimination, will go into effect Nov. 1, according to Der Spiegel. Parents of children born with both sex characteristics will be allowed to opt out of determining their baby's gender and to wait until later in life.

Or they may never officially declare a gender, leaving the child ""undetermined"" or ""unspecified"" on their birth certificates.

Canadian parents raise 'genderless' baby.

An estimated 1 in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl -- they are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development (DSD), an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries and/or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.

Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.

Today, gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign gender, then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.

New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law ""sounds like a good thing.""

Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.

""Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not,"" he said. ""You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then see how identity develops. The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.... Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens. It's like the mystery of why people are gay.""

A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as ""differ[ent] from trans [sexual or gender] people as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup (genetic, hormonal and physical features) which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.

""These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; and/or in chromosomal structures and hormones.""

The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.

Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.

Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a ""third gender"" on their official documents. In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized ""genderless"" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an ""unspecified"" gender status for life.

But German law has not clarified if it will apply to passports and other forms of identification.

In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report in France 24.

In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for ""gender theory"" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.

The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that ""(a)s the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization.""

One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.

""Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations especially if you don't know the gender of your child,"" she told the parenting website. ""Children need stability and certainty.""

Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality. And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.

But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.

""Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'"" said Drescher. ""When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.""

The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable. He coined the term ""gender identity"" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.

But in one 1966 case, known as ""John/Joan,"" his theories became controversial. He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.

""Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not,"" said Drescher. ""When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman. But at 38, he committed suicide.""

Drescher said that today, some doctors are still ""practicing that model."" But in the 1990s with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries came forward, ""not happy with the outcome.""

Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals. Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a ""satisfactory life"" as a man.

So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl. He was given female hormones at age 12.

""I knew that I wasn't a girl,"" he told ABCNews.com. ""I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.""

At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty. But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records. What he found out was horrifying. ""I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.""

Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals. After learning the truth, he transitioned back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed. Surgery rendered him infertile.

Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.

But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law ""invites labeling and stigma.""

""A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an 'undetermined,'"" she said. ""We are afraid it will encourage intervention. We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting. But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.""

Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because ""it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender.""

""Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,"" she said. ""German law is about assigning it at birth. That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point. When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.""

But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will ""empower"" both parents and children.

Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (cAIS). Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics. She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries. When she was 6, doctors discovered small testes in a hernia sac.

""The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves,"" said Baratz.

""It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing,"" she said.

http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Opinion/molotovs-hollow-gesture-solidarity-puto-controversy/story?id=19904640,"The year is 2000. Late August. New York City. You're a week shy of being newly-minted 20-year-old and find yourself in a sticky, sweating scrum of raza being pushed, pulled, and flung around a mosh pit around the center of Manhattan's club Exit. It's the local date of the six-band Latin Alternative caravan known as the Watcha Tour.

Mexico City's premier rap-rockers Molotov cap off their aggro set with ""Puto,"" their NSFR(adio/Television/most any place with any grown-ups or children gathered) track from their 1997 debut, ¿Dónde Jugarán las Niñas?. You're angry at the club's awful sound system, the air-conditionlessness, the security guards, anything and everything--te vale madres todo! You lose yourself and begin jumping and shouting along (""Puto! Puto! Puto!"").

You're queer. You sing anyway. You sing to the song's purported message about cowardice and rebellion and you willfully ignore its virulently homophobic undertones. You cheer and clap at the end. Then you swap moshpit war stories with your cousin while you wait for Café Tacvba to take the stage.

Cut to 2013. Springtime. You're a couple months shy from being a seasoned 30-something year-old. You're emailing about Molotov with some comadres from those very same days in the early aughts. Only today, you're all listening to them perform on Alt-Latino's SXSW showcase stream from the comforts of your respective outposts in Queens, Brooklyn, and Miami--not some now-defunct midtown concert venue.

Nostalgic, you're amused at the spectacle of leading a ""chinga tu madre"" audience call-and-response on (stuffy) national public radio. This time, however, the sound of a crowd shouting ""Puto! Puto! Puto!"" finds you aghast. It made you cringe.

You realized you're living in very different times. Same-sex marriage is the law of the land in many places, including the band's own home base, Mexico City. Of course, progress in LGBT civil rights has outpaced shifts in cultural attitudes towards homosexuality. But the song felt like an offensive relic--one that you were surprised was still being performed.

That's why you weren't shocked to learn last week that Molotov, in response to the brutal gay-bashing of a teen in Chile, would be removing ""maricón"" (a Spanish-language slur for homosexual men) from ""Puto"" ahead of its U.S. tour. But you wondered: why now? And why only in the States? The answer to both, it seems: years worth of pressure by stateside LGBT activists on the band and Jagermeister, its current tour sponsor.

Molotov didn't respond to an email for comment sent earlier this week.

It also made you question the sincerity behind a ""solidarity"" stand with a Chilean hate crime victim taken not in Chile, not in Latin America, but only in the States (before a tour through said country) and only conveyed in English.

Of course, the fact that Molotov's song ""Puto"" is just about chronologically old enough to catch Molotov live today doesn't escape you either. Molotov's humor is aggressive and immature. Its song lyrics are laden with crude wordplay. It's high school locker room fodder and, unfortunately, taunts and slurs like those ""Puto"" are still what you'd hear in many locker rooms.

The band's defenders are also quick point to the socially-minded part of Molotov's catalog, as if to somehow counteract questionable apples with progressive oranges. Songs like ""Voto Latino,"" ""Gimme Tha Power,"" and ""Frijolero"" champion equality as well as denounce corruption, racism, and xenophobia, yes, but you know better than to think being politically progressive precludes you from being homophobic.

The band has vehemently denied that their song is homophobic, and that may well be true, but the words themselves are too loaded and layered. Puto, joto, maricón, and marica—which are all in the song—sting for straight men to a certain extent because they're still readily-used pejoratives aimed at gay men. (There's also the weird glorification of machoness and violence in the song that seems to get less notice.)

At some point there has to be more of a reckoning about the climate and culture engendered by music, movies, TV programming with offensive content—and its role in perpetuating homophobia, bigotry, or misogyny. The Chilean gay-bashers have probably not been listening to ""Puto"" on repeat since 1997, or ever at all, but regardless there's something to be said about the way the media we consume influences or affirms our beliefs—good and bad. And while some would argue that songs like ""Puto"" are a by-product of widely-shared societal beliefs, either way, there has to be a discussion of the moral implications and real life consequences.

As artists, Molotov's members have the license to create the art they feel. As a consumer, you have the power to take it or leave it (particularly if it doesn't align with your values). Maybe this whole ""Puto""/maricón omission serves a more useful purpose as a catalyst for that discussion. Because on its own, it's clearly an hollow gesture begrudgingly imposed on a 16-year-old song. YouTube concert clips of audience members filling in the verboten word confirm it. The question is: do you care?",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/07/attorney-general-eric-holder-addresses-trayvon-martin-shooting-criticizes-stand-your-ground-laws/,"Attorney General Eric Holder strongly condemned ""Stand Your Ground"" laws today in a speech that became intensely personal at times and addressed the shooting of Trayvon Martin and Saturday's acquittal of George Zimmerman.

At the NAACP convention in Orlando, Fla., Holder, the first black attorney general, said of the ""Stand Your Ground"" laws that it is ""time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods.""

""These laws try to fix something that was never broken,"" Holder said at the Orange County Convention Center. ""There has always been a legal defense for using deadly force if - and the 'if' is important - no safe retreat is available. But we must examine laws that take this further by eliminating the common sense and age-old requirement that people who feel threatened have a duty to retreat, outside their home, if they can do so safely.""

Reaction to a juror who spoke out after the Zimmerman trial was furious. Find out more here.

""By allowing and perhaps encouraging violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety,"" he said.

""The list of resulting tragedies is long and - unfortunately - has victimized too many who are innocent,"" Holder said. ""It is our collective obligation - we must stand our ground - to ensure that our laws reduce violence, and take a hard look at laws that contribute to more violence than they prevent.""

""Stand Your Ground"" laws, which have passed in more than 30 states including Florida, allow people to defend themselves with deadly force, rather than retreating from the situation if they feel that they are in danger.

The killing of Martin and Zimmerman's acquittal has rippled through the NAACP convention, which was held just 30 miles from Sanford, Fla. On Monday, Benjamin Crump, the Martin family attorney, called for the federal government to take up the cause and for the Department of Justice to file charges against Zimmerman

""It seems like we are still fighting the fight that they fought so many years ago that we thought we won, but yet again here we are again crying out for legal justice,"" Crump said. ""It is going to be very important that we remain vocal and vigilant as we ask the federal government to get involved in this investigation because if we are not vocal and vigilant, I can tell you Trayvon's death will be swept under the rug.""

The NAACP also announced today that its online petition urging the DOJ to file charges against Zimmerman reached 1 million signatures in the two and half days since the verdict was announced Saturday evening.

Holder said he was ""concerned about the case"" and confirmed the DOJ is investigating and ""will continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law.""

""While that inquiry is ongoing, I can promise that the Department of Justice will consider all available information before determining what action to take,"" Holder said. ""We are committed to doing everything possible to ensure that - in every case, in every circumstance, and in every community - justice must be done.""

The George Zimmerman verdict rippled through the NAACP this week. Read more here.

The Department of Justice has been conducting its own investigation into whether the shooting was motivated by racial pretense, which means Zimmerman could be charged with a federal hate crime even though he was acquitted in state court.

Zimmerman, 29, was accused of second-degree murder for shooting Martin, 17, Feb. 26, 2012, inside a Sanford, Fla., gated subdivision where Martin's father lived. While Zimmerman admitted to shooting the unarmed teenager, he has maintained the teen attacked him and he acted in self-defense.

The case quickly developed racial overtones when Sanford law enforcement declined to arrest Zimmerman in the slaying of the unarmed black teen. Zimmerman's father is white and his mother is originally from Peru. He was arrested nearly two months after the incident when the state appointed Angela Corey as a special prosecutor and she brought second-degree murder charges against him.

A jury made up of six women found Zimmerman not guilty of both second-degree murder and manslaughter charges Saturday, after deliberating for more than 16 hours in two days.

Holder said the ""same issues"" that are at the core of the case drove his own father to sit down with him to talk ""about how as a young black man I should interact with the police, what to say, and how to conduct myself if I was ever stopped or confronted in a way I thought was unwarranted. I'm sure my father felt certain - at the time - that my parents' generation would be the last that had to worry about such things for their children.""

He said the news of Martin's death ""reminded"" him of his father's words as well as experiences he himself went through as a young man, recounting how he was ""pulled over twice and my car searched on the New Jersey Turnpike when I'm sure I wasn't speeding, or when I was stopped by a police officer while simply running to a catch a movie, at night in Georgetown, in Washington, D.C., I was at the time of that last incident a federal prosecutor.""

He said the 17-year-old's death also caused him to sit down with his own 15-year-old-son, as his father had with him, noting ""this was a father-son tradition I hoped would not need to be handed down.""

""But as a father who loves his son and who is more knowing in the ways of the world, I had to do this to protect my boy,"" Holder said. ""I am his father and it is my responsibility, not to burden him with the baggage of eras long gone, but to make him aware of the world he must still confront. This is a sad reality in a nation that is changing for the better in so many ways.""

Holder also urged calm in the wake of the verdict, praising those protests that have been peaceful since the decision Saturday night.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius also addressed the conference, speaking before Holder, and she too brought up the case, calling Martin's death a ""tragedy for his family and his community, but it's also a tragedy for our country.""

""But so are the tragedies of all the children we have lost because of gun violence before and since Trayvon was killed each and every day,"" Sebelius said. ""Now we pray for the Martin family and respect their call for calm reflection.""

NOTABLES

NO DEAL: A deeply divided Senate failed to reach agreement Monday night after more than three hours of discussion behind closed doors, raising the prospect that Democratic leaders were heading toward invoking the so-called ""nuclear option"" to confirm several of President Obama's top nominees whose confirmations have stalled, ABC's JEFF ZELENY and ARLETTE SAENZ report. As they left the Capitol after a rare bipartisan session, several senators told ABC News they were hopeful a resolution could be reached to the filibuster fight. The path remained highly uncertain, but advisers to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell continued their discussions into the night. Reid stepped before the cameras briefly, saying: ""We've had a very good conversation. The conversation is going to continue,"" McConnell did not speak publicly after the meeting. http://abcn.ws/1ap9CZk

QUOTE OF THE NIGHT: ""If we don't solve this problem, we'll be the Hatfields and the McCoys on steroids before this is over,"" said Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev. ""I don't want that to happen.""

HAPPENING TODAY: The Senate is still scheduled to begin a series of votes at later this morning at 11 a.m. on seven appointees whose nominations have been blocked by Republicans, setting the course for Democrats to change the rules in an extraordinary move that would end filibusters of executive branch nominees.

BACKSTORY, courtesy of ABC's JEFF ZELENY: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been threatening to invoke a plan known as the ""nuclear option,"" which would change Senate rules to allow an executive branch nominee to be confirmed by a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than the 60 votes normally required by the Senate. It would break filibusters for those nominated to serve in the Cabinet or the federal government, but would not include judges or legislation. The stalemate has festered in the Senate, particularly over nominees to the National Labor Relations Board, the Consumer Financial Protection Board, the Export-Import Bank and the Environmental Protection Agency. Republicans have strongly objected to the confirmations, arguing that the labor board wields too much power and the nominations were improper because they were made while the Senate was not in session. http://abcn.ws/1ap9CZk

THE ROUNDTABLE

ABC's RICK KLEIN: With the Senate on the verge of detonation, the biggest threat is to the Senate as we know it. But - really? How long has it been since the Senate was really as we imagine it to be - a place of ""cooling saucers"" and collegiality and clubs? The nuclear option would continue the Senate's path to House-dom (or worse), but it wouldn't start it. There might be something refreshing about the Senate's rules catching up to its realities - and exploding the myths that senators like to perpetuate about their jobs.

ABC's JEFF ZELENY: The outcome of the filibuster fight boils down to this: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will only allow votes on President Obama's nominees if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid agrees not to change the rules during the rest of this Congressional session. But Reid will only agree if McConnell pledges not to block any more executive branch nominations. McConnell has shown no signs of agreeing, so Reid is going around him. So will the coalition of Republicans, with Sen. John McCain at the helm, work around their leader and head off a nuclear showdown? This morning, more signs are pointing to yes, but the next hours are key.

ABC's SHUSHANNAH WALSHE: Michele Bachmann may be retiring, but that hasn't stopped her from grabbing headlines. Monday, the conservative website, World Net Daily, posted an interview with Bachmann in which she suggests, among other things, that Congress needs to give President Obama ""a spanking."" Yep, you read that right - and that's not all. World Net Daily asked Bachmann if she is concerned President Obama will do what he wants on immigration, despite what Congress says. ""Well, of course he's going to, unless we pinch his ears back,"" she said. ""He has a perpetual magic wand and nobody's given him a spanking yet and taken it out of his hand."" She added that Congress has the power to discipline the president: ""And the way we spank the president is we do it through the checkbook."" Also yesterday, it was revealed that one of Bachmann's senior aides, Javier Manuel Sanchez, was arrested on July 11. He has been charged in connection to a rash of burglaries in a congressional office building on Capitol Hill, according to the U.S. Capitol police. Bachmann's office quickly noted Sanchez was no longer employed. So, will Bachmann be able to command the headlines when she's gone from the halls of Capitol Hill? We will have to wait and see, but it seems difficult to sustain it.

WHAT WE'RE WATCHING

FROM A HUT IN AFRICA TO THE WHITE HOUSE: TWO PRESIDENTS HONOR A COUPLE'S WORK TO FIGHT HUNGER. Around the time Kathy Hamilton and Floyd Hammer were planning their retirement, they took an eye-opening trip to Tanzania, and the couple decided they still had work to do. ""When you stand in a hut in Africa, and you witness a young man die … there's no way to explain to you what the feeling is,"" Hammer told ABC's JONATHAN KARL, host of Politics Confidential, standing outside the White House. ""If we had had a meal with us, we might have saved that life."" After that trip 10 years ago, Hamilton and Hammer set out to combat hunger, starting a non-profit organization, Outreach, which now operates in more than 15 countries and has delivered more than 233 million free meals to children suffering from hunger. And, in a rare White House event Monday, Hamilton and Hammer were recognized for their contributions to combating hunger by not just one, but two U.S. presidents. President Obama and President George H.W. Bush shared the stage in presenting the 5000th Point of Light Award to the couple. http://yhoo.it/11Tlhzx

BUZZ

IMMIGRATION LIFTS RUBIO FUNDRAISING. It turns out the immigration debate may have been good for Sen. Marco Rubio's bottom line, ABC's JEFF ZELENY reports. He raised $3 million from April to June, according to a report to be filed with the Federal Election Commission, as the immigration debate was underway in the Senate. It was an increase of more than 30 percent from his fundraising in the first three months of the year. For his leading role in the immigration debate, Rubio won praise and drew critics from Republicans. But his latest financial report, reviewed by ABC News, shows that his base of supporters grew as his profile rose during the heated immigration debate. His finance report shows that he has nearly $3 million cash-on-hand in his various political committees, including $980,000 in the Reclaim America PAC and $1.97 million in his Senate re-election committee. The short-term politics of immigration remain an open question, particularly as the bill draws more criticism by conservatives in the House, but Rubio's role as a top proponent of the bill seems to have helped his ability to raise money. http://abcn.ws/13MrEGb

FORMER BACHMANN AIDE ARRESTED, CHARGED WITH THEFT. A former legislative aide to Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., was arrested July 11 and has been charged in connection to a rash of burglaries in a congressional office building on Capitol Hill, ABC's JOHN PARKINSON writes. Javier Manuel Sanchez, who was the congresswoman's senior legislative assistant at the time of the alleged burglaries, has been charged with second degree theft, according to the U.S. Capitol police. ""Earlier this year the United States Capitol Police (USCP) was apprised of thefts that occurred in the Rayburn House Office Building. The USCP conducted an investigation and were able to identify a subject. The investigation resulted in the arrest of 37 year old Javier Sanchez of Virginia,"" Shennell Antrobus, USPC public information officer, wrote in a statement Monday night. Antrobus declined to specify what Sanchez allegedly stole, but burglaries in congressional offices are not uncommon. Sanchez was arraigned July 12 and pleaded not guilty. He also asserted his right to a trial, according to documents filed in D.C. Superior Court. Bachmann spokesman Dan Kotman said Sanchez ""is no longer with the office."" http://abcn.ws/10XeTo7

GEORGE ZIMMERMAN ACQUITTAL RIPPLES THROUGH NAACP CONVENTION. Gathering in Florida just 30 miles from where a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty Saturday of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, speakers at the NAACP's national convention turned the event into a rallying cry for action and justice in Martin's name, ABC's SHUSHANNAH WALSHE notes. Benjamin Crump, the Martin family attorney, this morning called for the federal government to take up the cause and for the U.S. Department of Justice to file charges.

""He first bought the tiny company's stock after bunking down in its chief executive's six-bedroom home. … Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, Virginia's attorney general, said that the timing of his ownership of Star Scientific shares reflected nothing more than his own investment analysis. Star Scientific and its chief executive have been at the center of an exploding political drama in Virginia as state and federal investigators look into lavish gifts that the executive, Jonnie R. Williams Sr., gave Gov. Bob McDonnell. And now, despite his efforts to distance himself, scrutiny is growing of Mr. Cuccinelli's ties to the executive. … Last week Mr. Cuccinelli indirectly condemned Mr. McDonnell, a fellow Republican, for the first time, lamenting, 'What we've all been seeing is very painful for Virginia.' The statement followed a report that Mr. Williams's gifts to the governor and his family totaled $145,000, and included a Rolex watch, designer clothing and a $50,000 check to Mr. McDonnell's wife. The gifts were first revealed in The Washington Post. Mr. Williams, 57, also gave the attorney general $18,000 worth of gifts, including frequent stays at Mr. Williams's homes outside Richmond and in the Blue Ridge Mountains, according to Mr. Cuccinelli's financial disclosure statements.

""Young voters will soon begin to understand that their support of the president and his party, rather than improving their lives, has actually impeded their progress. As this economic picture comes into view - fewer jobs for younger voters, crushing student loan debt exacerbated by ham-handed political gestures and greater costs for an unworkable health care system - the GOP still has an opportunity to overcome its inherent challenges and make decisive gains among these voters. However, it will require a top-down commitment to another idea that seems to have been forgotten lately - rediscovering itself as the party of ideas and innovation. In the same manner that groups like The Heritage Foundation provided the intellectual and policy basis for an incoming generation of Reagan conservatives, the GOP must begin directing some of its energies away from just winning the political and messaging battle and toward finding solutions to health care, generational debt, entitlement programs and other issues that will not just resurrect that time-tested warhorses of policy battles long past, but earnestly seek to develop answers for this generation."" http://abcn.ws/10WOHtI

CONGRESS

ABC News' Jeff Zeleny: ""Harry Reid Vows to Break Filibuster Rule in This 'New Era'"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said today that he was not being hypocritical by pushing for a change in Senate filibuster rules that he strongly decried eight years ago, declaring, ""It's a new era."" ""It's a totally different world we live in,"" Reid said, accusing Republicans of being so entrenched in their obstruction to some of President Obama's top nominees that the Senate and other parts of the government have become paralyzed. LINK

The Wall Street Journal's Kristina Peterson and Corey Boles: ""No Breakthrough on Filibuster"" The Senate moved closer Monday night to a clash that could poison relations between the parties and stall a range of legislative business, after an unusual, closed-door meeting of nearly all 100 senators failed to resolve a dispute over President Barack Obama's executive-branch nominees. Senators emerged from the meeting, considered a last-ditch effort to avoid the confrontation, saying they had failed to reach an agreement on how to overhaul the rules for considering nominations to Mr. Obama's cabinet and other executive-branch positions. LINK

USA Today's Susan Davis: "" Senate still on path for Tuesday 'nuclear option' vote"" The U.S. Senate is going nuclear. Barring a last-minute deal, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., made clear he will move forward Tuesday with a controversial maneuver - known as the ""nuclear option"" - to change the chamber's rules to make it easier to confirm President Obama's executive branch nominees. LINK

The Hill's Alexander Bolton: "" Joint caucus meeting ends with no deal to avoid the nuclear option "" Senate Democrats and Republicans left a rare joint caucus meeting Monday evening without a deal to prevent Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) from going ""nuclear"" and changing the chamber's rules. Some lawmakers expressed hope Reid and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would strike a deal by Tuesday morning but no agreement appeared in sight shortly before 10 p.m. Monday. LINK

Bloomberg's Kathleen Hunter and Laura Litvan: "" Senate Nears Showdown Nominee Votes as Leaders Seek Deal"" The Senate is nearing showdown votes today over seven presidential nominees even as leaders seek a last-minute deal to avoid a change to the chamber's filibuster rules threatened by Democrats. Senators reported no agreement after Democrats and Republicans met privately for three and a half hours last night in Washington on the nominations that include Richard Cordray to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and nominees for the National Labor Relations Board. Republicans have pledged to block them. LINK

GEORGE ZIMMERMAN The Washington Post's Philip Rucker and Sari Horwitz: "" Civil Rights Charges Against Zimmerman Would Be Difficult, Justice Officials Say"" Current and former Justice Department officials said Monday that bringing civil rights charges against George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old in Florida, would be extremely difficult and may not be possible. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. vowed to continue a federal investigation of the matter, but other officials said in interviews that the government may not be able to charge Zimmerman with a federal hate crime because it's not clear that he killed Martin because of his race. LINK

The Hill's Jordy Yager and Justin Sink: "" Obama won't get into Zimmerman case"" The White House said Monday that President Obama will not be a part of the Justice Department's deliberations over whether to pursue federal hate crime charges against George Zimmerman, distancing itself from a decision fraught with the potential for political fallout. Attorney General Eric Holder offered no signal Monday about whether the department was leaning toward pursuing a case against Zimmerman, the Florida man found not guilty over the weekend of murdering Trayvon Martin.

IMMIGRATION REFORM

The Boston Globe's Noah Bierman: "" Hope for broad action on immigration dims"" Of the issues deemed most likely to break through congressional sclerosis this year, immigration policy overhaul once topped the list. But now a comprehensive Senate plan that passed with bipartisan support is dead in the House, casting serious doubt on further action on one of the nation's most vexing issues. House conservatives have balked, saying the Senate version is too ambitious and too lenient. LINK

SENATE CONTROL The Washington Times' Seth McLaughlin: "" Race to take control of Senate in 2014 'pretty close right now'"" Republican hopes for retaking the Senate in 2014 improved substantially this weekend when Democrats' best option declined to run for Montana's open seat. Democrats hold a 54 to 46 seat edge in the Senate, but Republicans are now considered the front-runners to capture the seats of retiring Democratic senators in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia.

""It seems like we are still fighting the fight that they fought so many years ago that we thought we won, but yet again here we are again crying out for legal justice,"" Crump said at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando. ""It is going to be very important that we remain vocal and vigilant as we ask the federal government to get involved in this investigation because if we are not vocal and vigilant, I can tell you Trayvon's death will be swept under the rug.""

Five Moments That Might Have Led to Zimmerman's Acquittal

The Justice Department released a statement after the verdict saying its investigation is ongoing. The agency has been conducting its own investigation into whether the shooting was motivated by racial pretense, which means Zimmerman could be charged with a federal hate crime even though he was acquitted this weekend in state court in Sanford, Fla.

""The Department continues to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial,"" a spokesman for the Department of Justice said in a statement Saturday after Zimmerman was acquitted.

Zimmerman, 29, was accused of second-degree murder for shooting Martin, 17, Feb. 26, 2012, inside a Sanford, Fla., gated subdivision where Martin's father lived. While Zimmerman admitted to shooting the unarmed teenager, he has maintained the teen attacked him and he acted in self-defense.

The case quickly developed racial overtones when Sanford law enforcement declined to arrest Zimmerman in the slaying of the unarmed black teen. Zimmerman's father is white and his mother is originally from Peru.

He was arrested nearly two months after the incident when the state appointed Angela Corey as a special prosecutor and she brought second-degree murder charges against him.

A jury made up of six women found Zimmerman not guilty of both second-degree murder and manslaughter charges Saturday, after deliberating for more than 16 hours in two days.

Crump, the family attorney, said the verdict ""broke their hearts again,"" referring to Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sabrina Fulton.

""Sabrina says she cried, she prayed, she cried some more and then she got up and went to church that morning and when she came home from church she called me up and said, 'Attorney Crump, I will not let this verdict define Trayvon. Our community will define Trayvon Martin's legacy. … We have now got to roll up our sleeves even though we've come a long way. We've got a long way to go to make sure this won't happen to anyone else's child especially in light of this verdict.'""

Throughout his speech, Crump was interrupted by applause from the crowd and he discussed how he sees the potential federal case, saying, ""The United State Supreme Court has said that the police cannot profile people so we are not going to let ordinary citizens profile our children? This could be anybody's child, this could be your child, the precedent has to be set so we've got to ask the federal government, the Department of Justice can anybody profile our children? Follow our children, confront our children just because they look like us?""

Crump praised the peaceful protesters who have gathered across the country since Zimmerman was acquitted, saying, ""We don't have to agree with this verdict. We can be upset with this verdict and that's OK, but we want all the people to be peaceful and I applaud these young people for protesting.""

Crump was far from the only impassioned speaker, almost every person who stood behind the podium today mentioned the case and Martin's death.

Sirius XM Satellite Radio host Joe Madison called Martin's killing ""nothing more than a modern-day lynching.""

""George Zimmerman became the judge, the jury, and the executioner of an innocent child,"" Madison said to cheers from the audience. ""You are Trayvon Martin, you are Trayvon Martin. … Don't let Trayvon Martin's death just be a moment, it has to become a movement and the difference between a movement and a moment is sacrifice.""

NAACP president Jealous began his address this afternoon by bringing his own two children on stage and then called for a prayer for Martin and his family. He too joined the call of action, even promising to ""roll back 'Stand Your Ground' laws.""

""In a democracy, organized people can win every time, but they must be organized,"" Jealous said. ""We will make this country safer for all of our children. …We will pass powerful anti-racial profiling ordinance.

""We will commit ourselves to ending the plague of gun violence on our streets, the plague of gun violence from the bad guys, and the plague of gun violence from the self-appointed good guys, too,"" Jealous said. ""Trayvon Martin wasn't somebody's youth or juvenile. Trayvon Martin was somebody's baby.""

The five-day convention officially opened Saturday put picked up today with the audience hearing from two lawmakers, who also mentioned the Martin case. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, said ""a young life was lost and it brings up more civil rights issues that we all care about.""

""Issues like fairness and equal justice under the law and reducing gun violence and a right to trial by jury, remember this that many parts of the world do not try to follow these concepts of justice, consider South Africa when Mandela was in prison,"" Nelson said. ""We are not a perfect nation, but we must try to be improve. Let us keep trying. We shall not be moved.""

Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., called for the nation to ""come together"" in the ""wake of the Trayvon Martin case.""

""We must come together as a nation to learn from the tragedy of his death and take steps to ensure the every single life is equally cherished and protected under our laws,"" Hoyer, the House Minority Whip, said. ""But, you are all leaders, you are all activists, you are all committed Americans you know a well as I do, as well as anyone who knows the history of this organization the fight for justice and equality continues.""

Okay, thanks. We're joined by george zimmerman's attorneys. You see all that anger and sadness. How much of it is george zimmerman aware of and how is it handling it? He's been aware of it for 16 months and sort of has become the focus of a lot of people's dismay, disgust, anger about the event that happened that night. Is he scared. Absolutely. He's scared for 16 months and with anger like this I think he has a good even to be worried. We know he's entitled to have his gun. You heard the prosecutors. He shouldn't carry one. Your response? I hear them say that. I don't know how he could not lawfully carry a gun now that he is allowed to carry one. This is the worst time of his life. You heard from the prosecutors. This he say he's a cold-blooded killer. Doesn't -- didn't have the courage to take the stand? Well, they were wrong when they charged him. I think they charged him for reasons having to do nothing with the facts of the case. The 18th judicial district decided to the to charge him but did. They were wrong then and wrong to continue with their prosecution and wrong about their opinions about him today. How does this all go forward at this point? We know the department of justice is considering civil rights charges and know the martin family is considering a civil suit. Do you think that has any chance of succeeding. I don't think the federal investigation will develop into any sort of charges. They've been at this since the beginning, as well. We have received extensive information along within the discovery in our case of what the fbi has done, absolutely nothing would suggest that this was a hate crime in any way whatsoever. You don't believe they'll bring a case. I don't think so. As far as a civil suit. That's up to the martin family. If you look at the facts of the case, as unfortunate as iwas we lost a young life it happened because of an intersection with some violence and only know george shot trayvon martin after 45 seconds of screaming and after getting battered so it's a very difficult situation. There may be some positive that can come out of this if we look in the right direction together. But there's not going to be a civil suit and if there is, they're not going to go anywhere. You mentioned the possibility george zimmerman might be bringing lawsuits himself. Well, you know, if you look at this case and take away the emotion of the loss of trayvon martin's life. If you take that away from it and look at what happened here, we had a good investigation done by law enforcement. We had a lot of political and social pressures put on this case that normally were not and should not be put on the case and there may be some compensation to something like that. From? From the way the prosecutors handled the case, who decided this case is going to get charged the way it was going to get charged and everything that's happened to george zimmerman. Finally you mentioned the possibility of healing. Is there anything your client can do to help that process? Well, unfortunately he's stilled looked as a pariah so i would like to say he could. I know he would like to but this is going to come with some peace being caused by other people. The martin family, everybody else who has their hatred, anger, at least, turn that toward something positive is what we hope for. Thanks very much.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-face-civil-suits-death-threats-federal/story?id=19661599,"George Zimmerman left a Florida courtroom Saturday night a free man after being acquitted of murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, but his troubles are likely far from over.

Although jail time is no longer a threat for Zimmerman, his lawyer says he fears for his life and may have to remain in hiding. He also potentially faces civil suits, which could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and cause possible financial ruin.

In criminal cases, the prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, and in most jurisdictions the jury's decision has to be unanimous. But in a civil case, the standard of proof is lower: The plaintiff's burden is, in essence, ""more likely than not,"" rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

Slideshow: The George Zimmerman Case in Pictures

According to Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Trayvon Martin's family, the parents of the slain teenager are considering additional legal options, including whether to sue Zimmerman in civil court.

""They are certainly going to look at that as an option,"" Crump said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""They deeply want a sense of justice. They deeply don't want their son's death to be in vain.""

The Orlando Sentinel reported in April that Martin's parents had settled a wrongful-death claim against the homeowners association of the Sanford, Fla., subdivision where their son was killed.

Zimmerman, 29, was accused of second degree murder for shooting Martin, 17, on Feb. 26, 2012 inside the gated community. While he admitted to shooting the unarmed teenager, Zimmerman maintained the teen attacked him and he acted in self defense.

The case quickly developed racial overtones when Sanford law enforcement declined to arrest Zimmerman. Zimmerman is white and Hispanic and Martin was black. Zimmerman was arrested nearly two months after the incident when the state appointed Angela Corey as a special prosecutor and she brought second degree murder charges against him.

A jury made up of six women found Zimmerman not guilty of both second-degree murder and manslaughter charges Saturday, after deliberating for more than 16 hours over two days.

""As you look at this case, you have what took place in the court, which had to deal with the law, but the court of public opinion is where this thing is exploded,"" ABC News Chief Investigative correspondent Pierre Thomas said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""The bar is extremely high, but the Justice Department will be under intense pressure by the civil rights community to do something.""

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) released a statement shortly after the verdict was announced, calling on the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder to take action after Zimmerman was found not guilty by a Florida jury.

""Today, justice failed Trayvon Martin and his family,"" said Roslyn M. Brock, Chairman of the NAACP. ""We call immediately for the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the civil rights violations committed against Trayvon Martin. This case has re-energized the movement to end racial profiling in the United States.""

An NAACP petition calling for a federal prosecution of Zimmerman has collected more than 350,000 signatures -- some 225,000 on the NAACP site and another 130,000 where it was posted online in the NAACP's partnership with MoveOn.org.

The U.S. Justice Department has been conducting its own investigation into whether the shooting was motivated by racial pretense, meaning Zimmerman could be charged with a federal hate crime even though he was acquitted in state court, and could also take Zimmerman to trial.

The DOJ released a statement post-verdict saying their investigation was ongoing.

""The department continues to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial,"" a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement Saturday.

Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara told reporters at a press conference Saturday that his client will now focus on getting his life back.

""This verdict still has nothing to do with civil rights. Civil rights has to be talked about, but not in relation to George Zimmerman,"" O'Mara said about the trial's effect on race relations. ""This is a tragedy but not one that Zimmerman is responsible for.""

But O'Mara told ABC News that Zimmerman continues to fear for his safety. He is still wearing a bulletproof vest and he may still have to live in hiding.

If a civil case is brought against Zimmerman, ""Nightline"" anchor and ABC's Chief Legal Affairs anchor Dan Abrams said that, in Florida, his defense team can make a motion to have a civil case dismissed under the ""Stand Your Ground"" law. It states that a person whose self defense claim is found lawful ""is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action for the use of such self defense.""

In April, Zimmerman's defense team chose to waive the pre-trial Stand Your Ground hearing, and put their case before a jury. The hearing would have given the judge the discretion to free Zimmerman, eliminating the need for a trial. But the validity of a Stand Your Ground defense would be determined solely by a judge.

If Zimmerman were given immunity from a civil suit under the ""Stand Your Ground"" law, Abrams said, the defense might be able to win ""reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, compensation for loss of income, and all expenses incurred in defense of any civil action brought by a plaintiff,"" according to Florida law.

Martin's family might be reluctant to file a civil suit, Abrams added, because they may decide it is not worth the emotional cost or they might fear that they could wind up owing Zimmerman money, if he is deemed to have ""stood his ground"" under the Florida law.

For defendants in high-profile murder cases, starting over after a not-guilty verdict can be extremely difficult. Casey Anthony, who acquitted of killing her daughter Caylee in 2011, still faces two civil defamation lawsuits.

She has been unemployed for four years and in hiding since her trial ended in 2011. She was the victim of a barrage of threats and was dubbed the most hated woman in America. Aside from a few stray photos, Anthony has succeeded in staying out of sight.

Jose Baez, Anthony's defense attorney, said on ""Good Morning America"" this morning that like Anthony, Zimmerman ""won't be able to live a normal life ever again.""

""They are forever etched in history and they will have to go and live quiet lives somewhere and try to do something with their lives,"" Baez said.

Last week, attorney Allan Watkins told ABCNews.com that Anthony was borrowing money from a friend to make a $25,000 payment that will settle $800,000 worth of debts Anthony owes to lawyers and other creditors in legal fees.

O.J. Simpson was acquitted of murder in the deaths of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1995, but then had to shell out millions in wrongful death civil suits brought forth by the victims' families. Then on Oct. 3, 2008, Simpson was convicted on armed robbery and kidnapping charges in an incident in which he claimed he was trying to get back sports memorabilia that had been taken from him, and was sentenced to nine to 33 years in prison.

Simpson has been serving his sentence at Lovelock Correctional Center in northern Nevada. A parole hearing is scheduled for July 25.

http://abcnews.go.com/News/arizona-woman-sues-school-district-religious-discrimination/story?id=19512300,"A former schoolteacher is suing a Phoenix school district for religious discrimination, alleging she was the target of several hate crimes involving swastikas that went unacknowledged by the principal and created a hostile work environment that forced her into early retirement.

Janet Seplow, 65, who is Jewish, claimed in a lawsuit filed June 21 in Maricopa County Court that Alhambra School District No. 68 discriminated against her and unfairly punished her when she complained about the alleged discrimination.

Seplow is suing for monetary compensation, but the amount she is seeking was not disclosed in the complaint.

Read about transgender teacher suing Catholic school over firing.

Between May and November 2008, Seplow alleges she encountered anti-Semitic vandalism on three separate occasions at the Montebello school in Phoenix. In May 2008, she found what she described as a ""massive"" swastika painted on the door of her classroom. In October of that year, she found another swastika fixed on her car, and filed a police report. In November, she found that students had taken her identification card and covered it with a swastika and a note saying, 'Hitler should have killed you, you f**king bitch.'""

Seplow described her reaction as one of ""absolute gross sadness"" and said that after the first incident she became so emotional she found it almost impossible to enter her classroom.

In the complaint, she alleges that the school did not launch an investigation after the first incident, and that the principal, Jeffrey Sprout, refused to walk to the parking lot to look at her car after it had been vandalized. He told her not to file a police report, according to the lawsuit. Only one of the students involved in vandalizing her ID card was punished, and was given a seven-day suspension, according to the lawsuit. Seplow told ABC News that she did not know exactly how many students were involved in the acts of vandalism.

After her car was vandalized with the swastika, Seplow told the school district's human resources department that she believed Sprout was anti-Semitic, and she requested a transfer because, she said, the incidents were traumatizing her. She was denied a transfer.

Seplow had been with the Montebello School since 1994, according to court documents. She told ABC News she had worked in various capacities at the school, serving as head of staff development and curriculum, in addition to teaching language arts.

""I was a damn good teacher. I loved my students, and I loved what I did,"" she said.

But in January 2009, Seplow said she received an evaluation from Sprout stating she had poor communication skills and was not getting along with her students. The complaint filed in court states that Sprout admonished her in the evaluations for telling human resources she believed he was anti-Semitic. He called the accusation ""categorically false.""

Sprout, who is currently the head of human resources in another Arizona school district, referred all comments to the Alhambra School District.

Robert Haws, the legal counsel for the Alhambra School District, wrote in an email to ABC News that no discrimination occurred, and that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission initially ruled in Alhambra's favor.

According to the lawsuit, Seplow filed two charges with the EEOC, one in December 2009, and one in June 2010. The lawsuit maintains that the EEOC ruled on the charge filed in 2009 and found reasonable cause to believe there had been a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and issued a right to sue notice for the charge filed in 2010.

Read about the teacher who sues for right to say N-word in class.

""If Ms. Seplow chooses to serve the lawsuit and tries, for a second time, to prove her accusations, we are confident Alhambra will prevail again, because there was no discrimination or retaliation,"" Haws wrote.

Seplow told ABC News that Sprout's performance evaluation had major implications for her career. ""In Arizona there is no teacher tenure, no unions. If a principal decides they want you out of a school, all they have to do is give you bad evaluations,"" she said.

On Oct. 26, 2009, according to the complaint, Seplow submitted her intent to retire at the end of the year. At 62, she said she was retiring four years earlier than expected.

Read about Ohio teacher claiming discrimination over her phobia of young children.

She had every intention of finishing out the year with her students, she said, but that November she was told she would assume the role of permanent substitute teacher.

Seplow, who has a doctorate in education, was placed on administrative leave in January 2010 for allegedly making inappropriate statements while she was substitute teaching. She retired at the end of that month. The early retirement, cost her, she said. Although she teaches part-time at Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix, she said she could not secure another full-time teaching position.

""If you don't have a recommendation from the school district you worked with for 17 years, it's hard to get anyone to hire you,"" she said. ""I spent all year looking for a position.

""I lost my profession, I lost my job, I lost everything,"" Seplow said.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/pork-laced-ammunition-designed-deter-terrorists/story?id=19473578,"New, pork-laced ammunition should serve as a warning shot to would-be Islamic terrorists with plans to attack Americans, the product's makers said today.

Jihawg Ammo, the company started by Brendon and Julie Hill of Coer D'Alene, Idaho, sells boxes of gun cartridges that are made with pork products and advertised as being a deterrent to potential terrorists who may not eat pork because of their religious beliefs.

""With Jihawg Ammo, you don't just kill an Islamist terrorist, you also send him to hell,"" the company said in a press release earlier this month. ""That should give would-be martyrs something to think about before they launch an attack. If it ever becomes necessary to defend yourself and those around you our ammo works on two levels.""

Brendon Hill, who developed the technology for the cartridges with his wife, said that the idea behind the ammunition was that if a devout Muslim were thinking of carrying out a terrorist attack, they might be deterred by knowing they could be shot with bullets covered in pork, a religiously forbidden food.

He is not promoting violence toward Muslims, he insisted. In fact, the company also makes apparel promoting ""Peace Through Pork.""

Brendon said that he and his wife started the company as a tongue-in-cheek way to stand up to radical Islamic terrorists.

""We're having some fun with it,"" Hill said. ""There's something to be said about using sarcasm to reveal truth about something that is false ora lie, and we're focusing on the absolute lie they tell that murdering people is good.""

""We realize we've hit an emotional thread, and I'd loosely define this as a red-state/blue-state issue,"" Hill added. ""That's where our customers are coming from and in that demographic, our product is a way to push back against political correctness. It's the proverbial middle finger back to political correctness.""

Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the Hills were trying to exploit Muslims for their own profit.

""This is just one of many individuals and companies who seek to make a quick buck exploiting the growing Islamaphobia in our society,"" Hooper said. ""We're not motivated by giving them free publicity they so desperately seek. That's their intention -- to get people upset so that they talk about it and they make money.

""If somebody did actually use one of these bullets to target a Muslim,"" he added, ""I am sure that a hate crime enhancement would fit.""

The Hills came up with the idea while camping with friends and talking about the ""Ground Zero Mosque,"" the name given by opponents to an Islamic cultural center in New York City that was going to open near the World Trade Center site.

They were angry over the center and what Hill called ""a wave of radical Islam perpetuating from the Middle East to Europe to here.""

Brendon Hill said his wife, stay-at-home mom Julie, came up with the idea and the name.

Brendon, who used to work for the NRA as a fundraiser, said he drew on his undergraduate science degree and tinkered with the formula for making the ammunition, figuring out how to add pork products to the paint on gun cartridges while ensuring that the paint still works.

They started selling their product earlier this spring.

""What we do is take industry base paint, a type of ballistic paint, and it took us a year to formulate how pork product that goes into it is still viable,"" Hill said. ""The paint still has to function and stick to metal, but also be haraam or unclean.""

He said that since they launched their website quietly two or three months ago, the Hills have been inundated with orders for their custom cartridges, which retail for about $20 for a box of cartridges. The reaction to their product has been almost universally positive.

""We've only got one voicemail that was negative and that was from somewhere overseas,"" he said. ""We are getting steamrolled by orders.""

However, Hooper, speaking from CAIR's headquarters in Washington, D.C., did not react positively.

""They're taking their own stereotypes and making it into their own idiocy, and unfortunately there are a lot of idiots to buy into this stuff,"" he said.",abcnews.com,True

The Stewart family of Milwaukie, Ore., discovered the swastika at around noon on June 18 and filed the report the same day, the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office in Oregon told ABC News. There was no evidence or surveillance of the act, police said.

The swastika was drawn backwards, according to a report from KATU. But Nicole Stewart, a member of the family, told KATU that detail was irrelevant. She said she thought it was still intended to show hatred for her family.

KATU/ABC News

""I knew it was targeted to our family because we're the only mixed family, African-American family in the neighborhood,"" she told KATU.

She added that she was friends with the majority of her neighbors and could not imagine them committing such an act of hatred.

The police were hesitant to classify the graffiti as a hate crime until they received more information, and were seeking tips from the public.

""We haven't ever taken reports dealing with swastikas or hate crimes, so we don't know if it was a hate crime or a stupid teenager,"" Robert Wurps, a spokesman for the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office, told ABCNews.com.

Wurps said the discovery was ""shocking.""

""It's disturbing to the public,"" he said. ""We see graffiti, but we don't see swastikas a whole bunch.""

http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/national-politics-inspire-hate-crimes-expert/story?id=19195183,"Can national politics inspire hate crimes? Mark Potok, who studies hate crime data as a Senior Fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, says yes.

Hate crimes against Muslims peaked dramatically in 2001, with the large bulk of the crimes taking place in the months following September 11th. Then Latinos became a target in the mid-2000's as the immigration debate intensified, Potok says. Between 2003 and 2007, there was approximately a 40 percent increase in hate crimes against Latinos, according to FBI hate crime data. Check out our interactive graphic here.

""That's the period where we hear Lou Dobbs ranting about immigrants bringing leprosy and crime across the borders, and he certainly wasn't the only one,"" Potok said in reference to the former CNN anchor, known for his strong stance on illegal immigration.

The latest available data shows a sharp decline in hate crimes against Latinos in 2011, which Potok says correlates with his perception that ""anti-Latino rhetoric has scaled back"" in recent years.

However, we don't know if the decline in anti-Latino hate crimes will continue, as FBI data on hate crimes for 2012 and 2013 has yet to be released.

A number of recent attacks against Latinos have police departments worried that immigrant groups, including Latinos, remain targets. In the 30,000-person city of Englewood, New Jersey, for example, there have been six attacks against Latino immigrants in just a month period.

""We have information that Hispanics are being targeted,"" Police Chief Arthur O'Keefe of Englewood said last month to NorthJersey.com. ""These are not isolated incidents.""

The Englewood police, like many other police departments around the country, believe hate crimes and offenses might actually go under reported in immigrant communities because of the fear of being deported if one is undocumented.

""The police are not interested in your immigration status,"" said Detective Capt. Tim Torell of the Engelwood police department. ""If you're a victim of a crime, were not going to do less for you than anyone else.""

The FBI gathers hate crime data on a state-by-state basis, however each state has slightly different qualifications for what constitutes a hate crime. In many states, the classification can apply to defamation of property (a disproportionate number of anti-Semitic hate crimes are property based) to murder and assault. Within the 15 year span of data from 1996-2011, there have been over 10,000 Latino victims of hate crimes.

Potok believes that we may see an uptick in crimes against Muslims in 2013, following the Boston bombing incidents.

""Words have consequences,"" Potok warned. ""Particularly when they come from people with prominent positions in the national debate.""",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/immigration-reform-latino-issue/story?id=19124548,"It's rare for a TV pundit or politico to talk about immigration reform these days without mention of Republicans losing the ""Latino vote."" But what they tend to forget is that about 2.5 million of the estimated 11.1 million undocumented immigrants living in this country are not from Latin America. And the majority of that minority (or about 1.3 million) is from Asia.

With immigration levels from Mexico slowing, the Latin American portion of immigrants living in the country illegally is shrinking in comparison to the portions from other countries. In other words, immigration isn't just a Latino issue, and it hasn't been for some time.

Until the 1980's, the majority of immigration to the U.S. was from Europe. This changed, in part, because of initiatives like the Bracero program that brought thousands of Mexicans to the United States to work. Even after it was shut down, immigrants kept coming for the same jobs, except they had no program to come through. This rise in undocumented immigrants led to President Ronald Reagan's Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. It was the first legislative attempt to comprehensively address the issue of unauthorized immigration, but has been heavily criticized for failing to secure the border and for encouraging document fraud.

Still, some 2.7 million people benefitted from the act. Of those, about 1 in 5 was from Asia, Africa or Europe. Many of those from Asia came to escape poverty or oppressive governments, to find better jobs for themselves or to secure educational opportunities for their children.

Noel's Story

Noel Bordador of the Philippines was among this group.

Bordador came to the U.S. in 1979 as a 14 year old with his parents from Southeast Asia. Now 48 years old, Bordador is an Episcopal priest who's chosen to practice mostly outside of the church, serving as a social worker in New York City and helping the city's homeless population find housing and employment.

Like most Asian beneficiaries of the amnesty bill, Bordador came to the U.S. on a valid visa and then overstayed its terms (Latin American beneficiaries were more likely to have entered the country without authorization.) He entered the U.S. with his family on a tourist visa, and was told by his parents that it had been converted into a student visa.

""All I know is that our immigration status lapsed in the early eighties, and I remember receiving a letter that said they were denying our request to stay,"" Bordador said.

When their visa request was denied, Bordador's parents returned to the Philippines, but decided that their two sons should stay and try to finish out their American education. Asian beneficiaries of the 1986 amnesty also tend to be a bit better off than those beneficiaries from Latin American countries. That's true for Bordador, who says it wasn't out of economic need that he remained, but because his parents hoped an American education would provide him with greater opportunities.

Bordador says he felt ""ashamed"" and lived in fear that he ""would be found out,"" especially every year in April.

""I filed my own taxes every year, even though there was a possibility I would be deported,"" he said.

When Reagan announced the amnesty bill in the '80s, Bordador, who is gay, says it was a relief. He would not have been able to live openly as a gay man if he had to return to the Philippines., where anti-LGBT hate crimes were commonplace at the time.

""The U.S. is a great country. Like any country it has some imperfections, but at least in this country I can open up my mouth and not feel like I'm going to be killed for my beliefs,"" he said.

Bordador applied for amnesty his junior year of college. He said it gave him hope that he could find work in a country that he considered his own, and allowed him to travel freely back to the Philippines to see his mother, father, brothers and sisters who he hadn't seen for nearly five years.

""I felt like I could really have a future here,"" he said. ""It was an exhilarating feeling when I finally was able to be open about who I was to the government.""

Immigration Debate For Asian Immigrants

While their circumstances may vary from those of Latino immigrants, overall the issue of immigration continues to be a huge topic for Asian communities living in the U.S. ( It still, however, ranks far behind unemployment and the economy when Asian voters are polled.)

Four out of the five countries with the longest visa wait times are in Asia (Philippines, Vietnam, China, India) and fifty-four percent of Asian-Americans say that the visa backlog is a serious or significant problem for their families, according to last year's National Asian American Survey.

And that means one thing: Asian voters have even more reason to care about immigration reform today than they did in 1986. Asians may have represented a smaller percentage of undocumented immigrants then and now, but they cannot be ignored in this process. The GOP, whose harsh rhetoric has hurt them with Latino voters, would do well to pay attention their standing with Asian voters as well.

Although most Asian-Americans supported Reagan and George H.W. Bush in '80's and '90's, a majority of Asian voters cast their votes for a Democrat in 2004-- John Kerry over George W. Bush. Last November, 73 percent of Asians voted for Barack Obama over Romney -- a higher percentage than Latinos.

For Asian voters, cutting down visa wait times and prioritizing family reunification visas will be of the utmost importance, according to DeepaIyer, the executive director of South Asian Americans Leading Together, or SAALT.

Iyer also says that there's a common misconception that Asian immigrants are mostly ""high-skilled workers.""

""These are people who are doing immigrant labor. They are working as waiters. They might be working as janitors. They might be domestic workers. They're also people who might be high-skilled workers who lost their jobs and don't have any way to regularize their status,"" Iyer told NPR.

""We're talking about a range of people - family members, grandmothers to immigrant laborers to high skilled workers - who are part of this undocumented community.""",abcnews.com,True

Right to george in los angeles. You spoke with a man so many are talking about this morning. Good morning, george. Boy, they are, robin. You know, that announcement from jason collins that surprise yesterday shattered stereotypes in the macho world of pro sports. When he went online monday morning you could feel the explosion everywhere. The 12-year nba veteran told me this was not the kind of spotlight he sought but now that he's made the announcement he says he's never been happier. The president called him immediately to offer support. I flew out here, met with him last night. It was an emotional, revealing interview. He's been a net, a hawk, a grizzly, a timber wolf and a wizard, a 7'tall, 255-pound bruiser who fought his way through 90 playoff game including back-to-back finals with the nets, tough, respected, a true team player, but never a household name like kobe, shaq, LeBRON UNTIL NOW. Jason collins is making history with t simple words, ""i'm a 34-year-old nba center. I'm black. And I'm gay."" And all the emotions stirred up by his announcement were catching up with him when I sat down with him in los angeles. You always knew you were gay? Yeah, it's -- I sort of describe it as you know that the sky is blue but you keep telling yourself that it's red. You fought it. Yes, in the beginning. I think they call it like the 12 steps, you know, you go through anger, denial and it's just -- but when you finally get to that point of acceptance, there's nothing more beautiful than just allowing yourself to really be happy and be comfortable in your own skin. So you send this thunderbolt out into the world. Yeah. 12 hours later, how does it feel? It's incredible. You just try to live a genuine life and next thing you know you have the president calling you. What did he say? He was incredibly supportive and he was proud of me and said that this not only affected my life but others going forward. Martina navratilova said this is going to save some kids' lives? You know, I look at her as one of my heroes, the dignity and the class that she's lived her life and all that she's achieved. She is my role model. Hopefully going forward I can be someone else's role model. What do you say to the 12-year-old boy out there practicing right now, wants to be a pro ball player and happens to be gay. It doesn't matter that you're gay bu the key thing is that it's about basketball. It's about working hard. It's about sacrificing for your team. It's all about dedication and that's what you should focus on. One of the things you write is that actually loyalty to your teammates is one of the things that held you back. Yes. From making this announcement. You don't want to be -- that distraction because for me it's always been about the team and -- but I think -- well, i know in m personal life I'm ready and I think the country is ready for supporting an openly gay basketball player. Can you believe it hasn't happened before you? That's kind of mind boggling. I never set out to be the first, and it's -- you know, obviously you're sort of waiting around for somebody else to, you know, raise their hand and, you know, I'm ready to raise my hand but you know you still look around like, okay, come on guys. Phil jackson says he's never met a gay player in the nba. Have you? Not that I know of. I don't know of any other gay players in the nba. Kobe bryant tweeted that he was proud of you today too. That was incredible. All the support has been overwhelming. As collins kept his secret he sent a small signal of unity to the gay community choosing to wear number 98 to honor matthew shepard. The gay teenager from wyoming kidnapped and killed in a brutal hate crime in 1998. Each time I put on jersey 98, this past season, I was already sort of having that moment with myself, with my family, with my friends who knew the significance of why I picked that number. Jersey 98 for matthew shepard. Jersey 98 for matthew shepard. That's why I wore jersey 98, so -- and also to mess with the rest. But, you know, the primary reason was every time I put on that jersey I was already making that statement to myself. You do foul a lot. You're a hard player. Yes, I -- you know, I bring that physical toughness, physical attitude and, you know, it's part of the game. As you write, it goes against the gay stereotype. That stereo -- yeah, that gay stereotype, you know what, i think that people like me are trying to rewrite -- people like me are trying to rewrite that stereotype and trying to let people know that you can't just put people in a box. As jason said it is all about the basketball. He's going to work hard all summer long to get picked up by another nba team and, robin, you know, he confessed to me when he walks out on to that court he knows the pressure is going to be on but he has no idea how it's going to feel to be the first openly gay player to actually play in an nba game but the way has handled himself thus far just so incredibly impressive.

http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/boston-bombing-acts-terror-made-minorities-cringe/story?id=19018447,"Hulton Archive/Getty Images ""Please don't let it be a Muslim,"" repeated Muslims around the world when first hearing of the Boston bombings. After 9/11, hate crimes against Muslims rose dramatically according to FBI. So there's legitimate concern that in the wake of the Boston bombing there will be a renewed spike in anti-Muslim fervor. But Muslims are hardly the first to worry that the horrific actions of a few will have a negative impact on all members of their group. Some of the deadliest U.S. terror plots, like the Oklahoma City bombing, were perpetrated by white men. However, at the turn of the century, German/Irish/Polish/Italian immigrants worried that they'd face added prejudice in the wake of bombings and assassinations perpetrated by members of their own ethnic group. Here are 8 terror plots and high profile crimes that made immigrant groups and ethnic minorities repeat the same ""Please don't let it be a ____ "" refrain throughout U.S. history.

Getty Images Haymarket Affair, 1886 The Haymarket Affair was a bombing that took place at a labor demonstration on Tuesday May 4, 1886, at Haymarket Square in Chicago. In all, seven policemen and four workers were killed when a dynamite bomb was thrown at the police as they attempted to disperse the protesters. Eight defendants were tried for the crime, five were from Germany and a sixth was a U.S.-born citizen of German descent. The Haymarket Affair ""set off a national wave of xenophobia, as hundreds of foreign-born radicals and labor leaders were rounded up in Chicago and elsewhere,"" according to the History Channel.

Getty Images Assassination of US President William McKinley, 1901 Leon Czolgosz, a 28-year-old American of Polish descent assassinated U.S. President William McKinley in 1901. ""After McKinley died, the American media blamed Polish immigrants. They were outsiders, foreigners, with a suspicious religion - Catholicism - and strange last names,"" wrote Al Jazeera columnist Sarah Kendzior. ""At a time when Eastern European immigrants were treated as inferior, Polish-Americans feared they would be punished as a group for the terrible actions of an individual. 'We feel the pain which this sad occurrence caused, not only in America, but throughout the whole world. All people are mourning, and it is caused by a maniac who is of our nationality,' a Polish-American newspaper wrote in an anguished editorial.'

Getty Images Bombing of Los Angeles Times Building, 1910 Brothers and labor leaders John and James McNamara admitted to bombing The Los Angeles Times building in 1910, and killing 21 workers. The press played up their Irish roots, according to historian Kristofer Allerfeldt, although their motivations seemingly had little to do with their ethnicity. The event also furthered national concerns over the radicalization of the American labor movement.

Getty Images The Preparedness Day Bombing in San Francisco, 1916 On July 22, 1916, a bomb went off at a parade held in anticipation of the United States' imminent entry into World War I. The suitcase bomb, which killed ten and wounded forty, was thought to be planted by labor leaders Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings, although both men were later pardoned. In the McNamara and the Mooney cases... ""'the 'perpetrators', like Csolgosz were American-born of Catholic stock, and like Csolgosz, the press frequently played them up as foreign -- in both cases, Irish -- and thus more prone to violence,"" wrote Kristofer Allertfeldt in his book Crime and the Rise of Modern America.

Getty Images Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti Indictment for Bank Robbery, 1920 Two Italian-born anarchists living in Boston were executed for allegedly murdering two men during a 1920 bank robbery despite overwhelming evidence against the pair. This particular case may have been the result of xenophobia and fear of radical communism, rather than one that invoked the sentiments. Either way, in the midst of the (first) Red Scare, Atlantic writer Sage Stossel wrote that ""it was clear that both the judge and jury were prejudiced against immigrants with radical political beliefs."" It is now widely believed that the two men were innocent. The year prior in 1919, a militant anarchist named Carlo Validinoci blew up the front of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer's home in DC, precipitating the the Palmer Raids of 1919 and 1920 in which 10,000 individuals suspected of radical leftist activity were arrested, 3,500 were held in detention, and 556 foreigners were eventually deported under the Immigration Act of 1918.

Getty Images The Wall Street Bombing, 1920 On September 16 of 1920, a blast killed 38 and seriously injured 143 on Wall Street. A horse-drawn wagon carrying 100 pounds of dynamite was detonated. Although the bombing was never solved, investigators believe it was carried out by Italian anarchists, furthering the so-called ""Red Scare.""

Getty Images Bombing of Sol Hurok's Office, 1972 An anonymous caller took responsibility for the 1972 bombing of impresario Sol Hurok's office on behalf of Jewish people in the Soviet Union. The bomb killed 2 and injured 9. The Jewish Defense League denied responsibility for the bombings, but applauded the bombers. The JDL has been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. This bombing was one of multiple acts of terror which was closely linked with the JDL in the 1970's. The terrorist acts reportedly made it harder for Jews to emigrate from Moscow to the United States. ""A number of Jewish activists refused permission to emigrate … feel that [anti-Soviet] harassment in New York hurts their cause and may give Soviet authorities an excuse to become even more intransigent,"" the New York Times reported at the time.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/call-careful-reporting-race-moments-tragedy/story?id=19001797,"Humans stereotype as a way of understanding a complicated world. Study after study shows that most of us do it, and that we do it even more when the stakes are high.

It might make sense then that following tragedies, like mass-shootings or the recent Boston marathon bombing, that the public and the media want desperately to know the skin color, ethnicity, and background of the people responsible for a horrific event. But when media outlets identify minorities as suspects before the facts are in, they are fanning prejudice that already exists in our country.

Amid the rush to identify the perpetrator this time around, a lot of (brown) people got hurt. On Thursday, The New York Post published a cover story with the image of a 17-year old Palestinian man and a friend with the caption ""Feds seek these two pictured at Boston Marathon."" A young Saudi man who was badly injured in the bombing was taken in for questioning by the Feds after being tackled by a bystander for ""looking suspicious"" as he fled from the scene. Many outlets quickly reported that a ""Saudi suspect"" was in custody. Then Fox News amended that statement, saying that the Saudi suspect was going to be deported. CNN then reported from their anonymous source that a ""dark-skinned"" suspect was in custody. Finally, there was Sunil Tripathi, a student at Brown, who was quickly dubbed one of the bombers when a person he went to high school with thought she recognized him in the surveillance images.

The problem with all those stories is that they were basically dead wrong.

The ""Saudi national"" had nothing to do with the attack (and he won't be deported.) Nor did the young Palestinian man the New York Post identified, but his mother remains ""sick and upset."" Despite the fact neither were involved, their names and images were spread around in tweets and in print, attached to the title of ""suspect.""

And CNN's so-called ""dark-skinned"" perpetrator turned out to be two fairly light-skinned Chechen brothers -- Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26.

Since September 11th, the FBI has found a dramatic spike in hate crimes against Muslims and Arabs. Similarly, since the Boston marathon bombing, there have been numerous attacks on men and women with darker skin and of Muslim faith. Abdullah Faruque, a Bangladeshi man who grew up in the Bronx, was reportedly attacked by three Latino men who called him a ""a f--king Arab"" on Thursday, invoking the events in Boston. On the same day, Heba Abolaban, a Muslim woman wearing a head scarf was punched by a man in Boston, who screamed at her.

""He was screaming 'F___ you Muslims! You are terrorists! I hate you! You are involved in the Boston explosions! F___ you!' "" Abolaban told Malden Patch. ""Oh my lord, I was extremely shocked.""

Another thing we know from social science, is that once learned, stereotypes can be hard to unlearn, even when we're presented with evidence that counters them.

Here's what we actually know about who commits terrorism in America: Sixty-one percent of the 337 people indicted for terrorism-related activities in the 10 years following 9/11 attacks were jihadists, and the rest subscribed to unrelated ideologies, including white supremacy and extreme anti-government doctrines, according to data collected by the New America Foundation. And, since 9/11, more people have died in terrorist attacks in the U.S. that were motivated by ideologies that have nothing to do with jihadist ideas, than those that were, the data set indicates.

Despite the fact that acts of terror can come from anywhere, as evidenced by the many mass shootings in recent years committed by American-born lone-wolf shooters like in Aurora and Newtown, media and society were fast to profile in the Boston bombings.

The actual perpetrators in some ways fit the profile of home-grown jihadi terrorists (seemingly becoming ""radicalized"" as young men in America) but in a lot of ways they simply don't. For example, Chechen terror is usually aimed at Russia, and not the United States, and both brothers have lived in the United States for over a decade. The younger brother was described as a ""nice kid"" who ""partied"" and smoked marijuana, by high school classmates on CNN. Drug use is looked down upon in Islam.

As the Boston bombing case shows, profiling has serious limits and often bad consequences. Newsmakers would do well to remember that the world is much more complicated and nuanced than our own biases.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Health/mike-rice-explosion-rage-intermittent-explosive-disorder/story?id=18881891,"Throwing balls, kicking players, shouting gay slurs -- all of these outbursts caught on videotape of Rutgers basketball coach Mike Rice reveal the abusive nature of uncontrollable anger.

Rice was fired this week, and faculty and alumni have been in an uproar. But was his angry performance during a men's basketball team practice last year just bad boy behavior or something more diagnosable?

""There is a misconception that getting anger out helps you calm down, but ironically, it makes you more angry,"" said Camp Hill, Pa., psychologist Pauline Wallin, author of the 2004 book ""Taming Your Inner Brat.""

Watch more on this story on ""20/20: Losing It!"" Friday at 10 ET

""The angrier you get, it gets increasingly harder as you are pumping more adrenaline, and there is more energy to discharge. Yelling and screaming don't get you calmer, they rile you up.""

The university's reputation is still stinging from the 2010 suicide of gay student Tyler Clemente, whose roommate had secretly videotaped the freshman having sex and was convicted of a hate crime..

Today, a group of 13 faculty and alumni demanded that university president Robert Barchi resign, because it took months for him to take action.

Barchi first viewed the video in November and sent Rice to anger management counseling. He fired the coach on April 3, when the video again resurfaced.

Even New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie weighed in on Rice, applauding the firing in the New York Times: ""The way these young men were treated by the head coach was completely unacceptable and violates the trust parents put in Rutgers University.""

Experts say the most common form of aggressive anger is rage, which is a psychological and physiological response to a stressor event. A person can lose his or her capacity for rational thought. The capacity for rage often begins early in life and continues through adulthood.

A person in rage may also experience tunnel vision, muffled hearing, increased heart rate and hyperventilation. The large amounts of adrenaline and oxygen in the bloodstream may cause a person's extremities to shake.

Psychiatrists say the most extreme form of rage is intermittent explosive disorder, or IED. ""It's somebody who really lacks control and is way over the top,"" said Wallin, who did not speculate on why Rice behaved as he did.

According to the Mayo Clinic, the disorder, which is listed in the DSM-V, involves repeated episodes of ""impulsive, aggressive, violent behavior or angry verbal outbursts in which you react grossly out of proportion to the situation.""

Recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggression affects 5 to 7 percent of the population, but many Americans do not seek treatment, according to a study published by the American Medical Association.

Research shows that chemical abnormalities are associated with this disorder. People with IED can suddenly explode without provocation.

Examples can include road rage, domestic abuse, throwing or breaking objects, or other temper tantrums. Those affected may attack others, cause bodily injury and property damage. They may also hurt themselves. Later, when they have calmed down, they can feel remorse, regret or shame. Effective treatments can include antidepressants and cognitive behavior therapy.

Wallin admits she is not an expert in IED, but she has witnessed plenty of anger, including physical fights, at sporting events like hockey.

""They are yelling at each other, sitting down and getting rough with each other and all excited with the adrenaline,"" she said. ""The reason they have no control is they are really hyped up. Even the fans love to see the fights.""

Experts caution that IED goes outside the bounds of normal anger and is considered an impulse disorder.

Anger is a ""normal part of being a human being,"" said Dr. Joseph Shrand, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and author of ""Outsmarting Anger: Strategies for Diffusing Our Most Dangerous Emotion.""

""You have to be very cautious not to hide normal behavior behind a psychiatric diagnosis,"" said Shrand, who runs the High Point Treatment Center in Brockton, Mass., working with troubled and angry youth.

""In this case, what [Rice] is really exposing is a culture where coaches somehow are basically sanctioned and condoned bullies,"" he said.

""It sheds a spotlight on aggressive and ferocious coaching that [coaches] think is inspiring and motivating,"" he said. ""They are harassing [players] and belittling them -- the complete opposite. We want to inspire kids and remind them they are amazing, not telling them they are good for nothing.""

""Anger is an emotion designed to change the behavior of someone else,"" said Shrand. ""You need to respond with respect. When is the last time you got angry at someone treating you with respect?""

Rice is hardly the first coach to exhibit shocking behavior on the basketball court. In 1985, then Hoosiers coach Bobby Knight threw a chair at a referee during an important game. He later said he regretted the bad behavior.

Dr. Redford Williams, director of the Behavioral Medicine Research Center at Duke University Medical School, called the Rice incident ""Bobby Knight redux.""

""It becomes dysfunctional for sure when you lose your job for your behavior,"" he said. ""It's clear this was above and beyond what is normal for a coach to be doing this toward the people he is working with.""

Anger management can work for people like Rice, according to Williams, who has not treated Rice, but saw the videos.

Williams and his wife developed a LifeSkills program that has been shown effective in reducing anger in high school students who are violent offenders. He said the steps could even be useful on the basketball court.

""It teaches the person to increase their awareness of their thoughts and feelings in situations that make them angry,"" he said.

""First you have to make sure you have the facts -- a kid threw a ball forward, not back to a guard,"" he said. ""You told him to go for the basket at the end of the game and he goes for the basket.""

Williams said that instead of an outburst, analyze thoughts first: ""What a dumb thing to do. I have feelings of anger and rage that will cause us to lose the game.""

Then, said Williams, ask four questions: Is this important? Is what I am thinking appropriate? Is it modifiable? Is it worth it? [I am worth it].

""If you get four yes'es, that means you need to take action, but it doesn't mean you are 007 with a license to kill,"" he said.

""Guys like the Rutgers coach can learn anger management,"" said Williams. ""It's not rocket science and there's evidence it works.""

Let's bring in the rest of the roundtable. Newark mayor cory booker, matthew dowd, katrina vanden heuvel and jeff zeleny. Welcome to you. Great to have you here. Let's talk about gay marriage first, and it certainly appeared that a lot of the justices may have been looking for a way out on this proposition 8. You want us to step in and render a decision based on assessment of the effects of this institution which is newer than cell phones or the internet? We have five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years of history or more. If the issue is letting the states experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction, why is taking a case now the answer? And, matthew dowd, it's perilous to try to read decisions into questions from the justices. There did seem to be a lot of discomfort on the part of the justices by stepping into this case as this nationwide movement is starting to grow. To me, it's surprising that the supreme court is that actually far out of tune where the country is, a majority of the country supports same-sex marriage, a vast majority of country. The country is more evolved and more consistent on this issue than any other social issue that has come before the supreme court. More than it was on interracial marriage. Only 20% of people supported interracial marriage in 1967. More on this than civil rights and abortion. I don't understand why the supreme court seems reluctant to weigh in an issue where the country is already -- it could be that more than 30 states are banning gay marriage. I would be opposed to gay marriage. Even if I supported it, I don't think the supreme court should be making that decision. It should work its way through state legislation. Through congress, perhaps. Again, we should have full equalities, as far as finances and as far as other issues. We don't know what all of the consequences could be that are unintended right now. Ruth bader ginsburg said that it could have been a mistake roe v wade. Pro-choice perspective because it took it away for the legislators. Look, this is an anguished reality. Where we have a second-class citizenship for millions and millions of americans that are denied over a thousand laws. Thank god that we didn't wait for the states on women, equality, african-american equality. This to me, is clearly, we know, as king said, the arc of a moral universe. It seems as if, that the case came to the supreme court in the first place because the most conservative justices thought that this might be their last chance to hold a line. Justice delayed is justice denied. I think the supreme court is lagging so far behind now, that marriage equality has won in the country. The only thing that you and rush limbaugh agree on. It's moving in states and politically. I think you have seen perhaps the most rapid mass evolution on an issue among our politicos. They know where the future of this country is. It's qualifier to win a next generation. Whatever happens in the court and it may well be that kennedy -- justice kennedy's consuming affection for state rights does lead to overruling doma. I think we're going to see social, moral and political paradigm shifts that are extraordinary. We already saw a glimpse this week, not only at the court, jeff, you had six democratic senators, right here, flip on the issue on same-sex marriage, just this week alone, and that prompted a comment from the bench, from chief justice roberts. You don't doubt that the lobby supporting the enactment of same-sex marriage laws in different states is politically powerful, do you? With respect to that category, that categorization of the term for purposes of heightened scrutiny I would, your honor. Really? Yes. Pointed commentary from the chief justice. He also seemed almost scornful of president obama, he said, for trying to have it both ways on the defensive marriage act. Democrats are not doing this because they have suddenly come to this position. Most of them believed that already. In fact, it's dangerous for them not to do it. So the question here is -- even in the red states? Well, for democrats, it probably is, but the thing that I'm really looking for going ahead here, on the republican side, when does this start to become okay to switch your position, and I'm looking at the donor class, there are more and more donors. He doesn't care about same-sex marriage. Some other super pac contributors are supportive of this on the republican side. Hold on, are you feeling that change among your supporters? There's change out there. No doubt about it. I think, by the way, this sounds naive, should be addressed in a nonpolitical way. I mean, my concerns is, changing an institution that quickly, just because you have six senators switching last week, polls reversing in eight, nine years, again, we have to look at the consequences of changing the institution. George, I want to talk about that first is, this issue is changing already. People developed this myth about 2004 that gay marriage had an effect. I was there. They had no effect on the ballot. This issue has been changing for a while. The argument to me, that this is an institution, a traditional institution for 2,000, 3,000 years, ignores the fact that the institution that, if you want to go to traditional marriage, it wasn't monogamous, women was property ay couldn't give consent. That was the traditional view of marriage for 2,000 years. Marriage has evolved over the course of time. This is just another evolution. Year sensitive to -- the decision is not evolving. Same-sex marriage is very, very important part of lgbt equality, but it's not the only part. I do think some attention should be paid in congress to reviving the federal, nondiscriminational employment act. Which was introduced last year, because fbi numbers show a rise in hate crimes against gays. And there are at least 20 states in the country where there is still discrimination. The marriage piece is important. But I don't think it should consume the full attention. Finally, the court has lagged behind as cory noted on many issues. It lagged behind on brown versus board. I think there should be a nod to the extraordinary progression where the president spoke of in his inaugural. It took activists and organizing and personal stories, seen in their own lives. The reflection of bigotry. You can't say you're bang it on polls and public opinion. Then you have a referendum in california which was adopted by a solid majority of the people. There's still a conflict. I respect that. I also think it's an urban myth THAT MYTHOLOGY THAT ROE v. Wade elicited a backlash. Linda greenhouse wrote a book, before roe v wade, very clearly the right wing was appearing to use abortion to realign the political parties. They did. Liberal justice, ginsburg. I respect her views. But there are difference of views. This is a story of america, expanding rights. 8 in 10 americans born since 1980 support gay marriage. So, we see -- one thing that you don't see moving in the president's direction since the inaugural is support for his proposals on gun control. And the president took issue with that this weekend and got quite emotional when he was talking about it. Less than 100 days ago happened. And the entire country was shot. The entire country pledged we would do something about it and this time it would be different. Shame on us if we have forgotten. I haven't forgotten those kids. Shame on us if we have forgotten. Look at the latest poll from cbs. Support for gun control in december 2012, 57% for new gun control laws. Stricter gun control laws. Now, down to 47 .Cory booker, so shame on you? Shame on us, because the tragedies haven't stopped. There are still thousands of americans who are being murdered every single day. We had an innocent man in my city injured by a handgun that didn't come from within our state. This is very problematic when you have majority of the people, 90 prkt of people, 80% of gun owners agree on sensible gun reforms that would stop the carnage. You're talking background checks? I'm talking background checks, punishments against purchases. sure. Imagine the tsa, we're not going to check 40% of the people that board our planes. That's what we're doing right now. A terrorist in our country can go to certain areas of our country and buy weapons. Americans are in agreement on this. Where is this going in the house, congressman? We have seen republican senators who say that they're going to filibuster -- I supported the president's position on guns. Having said that, it's going to be very difficult to legislation through -- despite what the mayor was saying -- a majority of americans don't seem to want this type of legislation. I support it. I'm, again, for background checks, gun trafficking, assault weapons, all that. I don't see the attention building up. That's what you're seeing in the senate right now? And this is senate democrats. You can go down the lists of democrats who are up for re-election in 2014 who are not supportive of anything beyond background checks. The president is talking a lot. At the courthouse was a big moment, going out on the p this week to talk about this as well. But, behind the scenes, they realize that the assault weapons bans and other things are nonstarter. And the fight is not over. You cite your the cbs. Cite your own poll. When asked about universal background checks, 90% support that. How many things in america do 90% of americans support? Listen, in the collective, in our collective grief over newtown, we thought things would move in this congress. This congress doesn't move very well. It took five years to pass the BRADY BILL IN THE '90s. So, I think you're seeing movement, responsible gun owners are being peeled away from the nra. You're seeing movement. Your seeing a movement. You're seeing money come in. WHICH DIDN'T EXIST IN THE '90s. The movement, I think, will play A ROLE AS IT DID IN THE '90s TO Slay this beast. We'll see movement and it will force a vote on certain amendments. Even if you don't get the assault -- military-style assault weapons. I live in texas, living in the heart of gun ownership, i think what happens in these situations, yes, there's a huge part of the country that supports various things, background checks, high-capacity clips, the country supports, but I think what happens is, there's a sense of people in the middle of the country that there's some elite trying to tell us what to do. Yes, we need to protect our children. But some mayor out there is trying to tell us what to do. Mayor bloomberg's effort actually hurts? When he goes too far out of the way here's what's best for you, here's a reasonable approach -- this is what's going to save lives. I think all of that can pass. The problem in washington, d.C., they're traditionally afraid of their own shadow. The nra has become a myth in washington. The nra isn't as powerful as everybody thinks. The people in washington think it is. If they pass reasonable gun restrictive measures, the country will support it. Look at 2014. But the reality is, mayor bloomberg has joined with the coalition of mayors, there are hundreds of us -- republicans, democrats and independents -- who have joined the coalition, what we have said, commonsense rules and regulations. The nra has done a wonderful job of obscuring this issue. Those senators that you said aren't against background checks. We have background checks right now. And I support strict background checks. Was the real opposition, people don't want it reported. Or among friends. That's often where krilal guns are handed down. I support it. The question is, from marriage equalit this, do you believe in america is greater than the power -- it has shifted dramatically to protect and affirm rights. One issue that's moving in congress immigration reform. We only have a couple of minutes left. Jeff, there does appear to be a breakthrough on this issue on a proposal just this weekend? This is a big deal. One of the key sticking points here. Unions, big labor has always been opposed to this. There was an agreement reached friday night between the labor coalition and the business coalition over the guest worker program. They're taking it back to the gang of eight. Senator marco rubio released a statement just this morning and he is saying that this sounds good, but hold on a little bit. Conservatives and republicans are slightly uneasy that this is being pushed through. This is a big deal. When congress comes back next week, one of these big immigration -- political suicide for the republicans if they don't really go along with immigration. I mean, as you head into 2014, the republicans have been big problems on immigration, on same-sex marriage, on commonsense gun reform. Only 30 seconds left. The republican leadership seems to have gotten this message in both the house and I think the senate. It's take an series of elections to get that message. The fact is, the fastest rising group in this country is latinos. They understand they have to do something. They're trying to keep their base happy. They know they have to do something. And border security. Eight guys in a room saying the border is going to be secure, is not enough. For 27 years they haven't been able to secure the border. I'm for immigration. I dwru up in an immigrant neighborhood. Border security is real. It's not some made-up issue. There are immigrants in our country who are being abused by unscrupulous employees. Violating their rights. Victims of crime in immigrants are targeted. They're afraid to come forward and report the crimes. That will have to be the last word. Thank you all very much. We'll be right back.

The FBI said in a statement that it ""initiated contact"" with Mississippi police on March 1 ""to offer assistance.""

""The FBI will continue its ongoing dialogue and sharing of information with the local and state agencies, and will continue to monitor this investigation for any indication that a potential violation of federal law exists,"" FBI spokeswoman Deborah Madden said in a statement.

Marco McMillian, 34, was found dead on Feb. 27. He was the Democratic candidate for mayor in the delta town of Clarksdale, Miss., and was considered one of the first viable openly gay candidates to run for office in the state. According to his family he was beaten, dragged from his car and burned after his death.

Lawrence Reed, 22, is the sole suspect and has been charged with murder.

State and local authorities are investigating the murder. Mississippi has a hate crime law that applies to victims of race-based crimes, but does not apply to sexual orientation.

Both McMillian and Reed are black.

On Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democratic congressman whose district covers Clarksdale and who knew McMillian, called on federal authorities to investigate McMillian's death.

Cops found Reed in McMillian's car on Feb. 26, after he crashed the vehicle. McMillian, however, was nowhere to be found until the next day when his body was discovered.

Reed was taken to a nearby hospital in Tennessee. He was released on Sunday and remains in custody there, while awaiting extradition to Mississippi.

Police have not released a cause of death pending the results of a toxicology test, but McMillian's family said they were told he was severely beaten and burned after his death.

ABC News affiliate WPTY-TV on Tuesday reported that Reed contacted a family of sisters early on the morning of Feb. 26, prior to his car accident, in which he confessed to killing McMillian in self defense.

""He called at 12:11 a.m. and he told her that the dude [McMillian] was trying to rape him. He was exposing himself to him, playing with himself, telling him to do things and then he'll take him home,"" one family member, who was granted anonymity, told the station.

""He just looked like he had been through war..."" another sister said. ""He was standing in the back, back here, telling God to forgive him. He didn't mean to do it, and he was saying that he just wanted to die.""

The sisters said they believed Reed was suicidal. ""When he left out, he just drove out, sped up and hit a white truck head on.""",abcnews.com,True

Lawrence Reed, of Shelby, MS was pulled from a wrecked car belonging to McMillian about thirty miles away from where McMillian's body was discovered in the woods near the Mississippi-Yazoo levee. He was airlifted to the Regional Medical Center at Memphis, and will be extradited to Mississippi once he is released from the hospital.

It was not immediately clear whether or not Reed has an attorney.

Sources told ABC News affiliate WPTY, McMillian had been strangled. The Coahoma County Sheriff's office told ABCNews.com they could not confirm a cause of death at this time, and that autopsy results on McMillian's body are expected within a day.

According to WPTY, Lawrence Reed's sister claimed Reed didn't know McMillian was gay, and that McMillian may have made sexual advances toward Reed in the car.

Jarod Keith, McMillian's campaign spokesperson, told The Associated Press McMillian's campaign was noteworthy because he may have been the first openly gay man to be a viable candidate for public office in Mississippi.

Keith told ABC News Radio he did not think McMillian's death was politically motivated or a hate crime.

The Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund and Institute tweeted: ""Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Marco McMillian, one of the 1st viable openly #LGBT candidates in Mississippi.""

McMillian was a magna cum laude graduate of the W.E.B. DuBois Honors College at Jackson State University and held a master's degree from Saint Mary's University of Minnesota in the area of Philanthropy and Development, according to his website.

Photos on McMillian's website showed him in an undated photo with Barack Obama.

http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/profile-pedro-julio-serrano-puerto-ricos-prominent-human/story?id=18458343,"The words ""CUÍDATE, PATO"" were scrawled across a piece of paper that had been tucked under Pedro Julio Serrano's windshield wiper.

""'Take care of yourself, faggot,' it means in English',"" Pedro Julio said.

It was 1998 and the then-24-year-old Pedro Julio was running as the first openly gay candidate of the Puerto Rican House of Representatives. He spent a few seconds inspecting his blue Oldsmobile after reading the hateful words of warning, and noticing his car hood wasn't pushed down fully, he called a good friend to take another look at the vehicle. His brake chords had been cut -- an attempt to intimidate, injure, or kill the young candidate.

Anti-gay hate crimes are rampant on the island, which has a population of 3.5 million, about the size of Connecticut. Nearly two dozen members of the LGBT community were murdered in Puerto Rico between 2009 and 2011 alone.

Pedro Julio, who has led the fight for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights in Puerto Rico over the past decade, still doesn't go a day without some form of hate or bullying from the many who despise him. Now 38 years old, he is one of the most recognizable, and most controversial, public figures in Puerto Rico. For some on the island, he is a living historical icon, a Gandhi with a Twitter account, and for others, he embodies the erosion of a traditional Puerto Rico and its moral code.

From his dimly-lit office in Manhattan's Financial District, Pedro Julio, a thin man with a school-boy's part, influences many of tomorrow's headlines in Puerto Rico's top newspapers. With posts on Facebook and Twitter every hour which go out to his more than 30,000 followers, Serrano drives the news cycle.

Currently, he's advocating that the gruesome murder of a member of the gay community be investigated as a hate crime and pushing for the passage of a gay marriage bill on the island.

""I hope to be married in Puerto Rico in June,"" he said last month, in an interview on local TV. But, on the day I joined him in his office last month, he'd only slept a couple of hours in the previous two days, something not out of the ordinary for him. The night before, a key Puerto Rican political adviser on the government's payroll called him a gross, promiscuous scoundrel over Twitter and Pedro Julio decided that he would bring the case to court. His phone buzzed every few seconds with messages of love and support, but also messages of derision, and bigotry from Puerto Ricans living on the island and from those who have migrated to the mainland as part of a larger boricua diaspora.

""My job is physically and emotionally exhausting,"" he told me.

As I spoke with him, Pedro Julio's face underwent extraordinary emotional shifts at a rapid pace. He smiled with large white teeth as he told me a story about how his future husband Steven Toledo fell in love with him. Seconds later, his face turned sharp, his jowls clenched, and his tone became authoritative, as he prepared for one of his four phone interviews with Puerto Rican media that morning.

Dethroning the Queen of Puerto Rico's Airways

Last month, Pedro Julio won perhaps the biggest victory of his life, when he helped bring down the most popular television show on the island, called SuperXclusivo. In 2006, La Comay, a sassy life-sized she-puppet who sat atop a red and silver throne tore Pedro Julio apart on television for his activism on the island. As part of his/her vicious attack (the puppet is voiced by a man named Antulio 'Kobbo' Santarrosa'), La Comay called him a ""pato"" -- a word which literally means 'duck,' but is widely considered a derogatory term for gay men on the island.

At the time, Pedro Julio demanded an apology from the lady-puppet and his co-host Hector Travieso. But instead, La Comay responded:

""Look, Pedro Julio Serrano, we, the Puerto Rican people, are not at fault for the fact that you have these repressed desires, for the fact that you are a 'pato,'"" La Comay said on the show in Spanish, which aired on WAPA TV.

Following the broadcast, Pedro Julio told the Spanish news outlet EFE, ""[Santarrosa's] greatest punishment, as a homophobic man, will be that an open and proud gay man will be the one to oust him from television.""

But few believed it possible to dethrone the queen of Puerto Rico's airwaves. The same show has also faced criticism for using the word ""monos"" or monkeys to describe black people, for attempting to ""out"" individuals they believed were gay, and for poking fun at women for their weight. But in December of 2012, Santarrosa would make his fatal move by presenting the possibility that the victim of a brutal murder on the island had brought it on himself by soliciting prostitution.

""Was this man, José Enrique, asking for this?"" La Comay asked.

It was the last straw. The statement triggered Puerto Rican activist and I.T. specialist Carlos Rivera to start a Facebook group called ""Boicot La Comay,"" which in a few days ballooned to 70,000 people. Pedro Julio would be the driving force and spokesperson in the boycott which successfully pressured Coco-Cola, Ford, Chevrolet, WalMart, AT&T, and Sprint, and more than 40 other companies to pull their ad dollars from the program.

Pedro Julio says social media has provided the perfect tool to lead his movement.

""It's an instrument which levels the field. No one has to go through intermediaries anymore,"" Pedro Julio said. ""Social media is like a public plaza, which allows us to denounce or support what we want, and people don't even have to go to the street anymore to do it.""

Critics said the movement was censorship from a small minority, but Pedro Julio says that the mass outcry pressured companies, concerned for their image, to make good business decisions.

""Freedom of expression is not an absolute right. It reaches a limit when you abuse the dignity of another person,"" said Pedro Julio. ""And that's what La Comay did constantly. She was a bully.""

Just over a month after the boycott started, Santarrosa resigned, and the show was canceled. A 12 year reign at the top was over.

Growing Up and Coming Out

Born in the Southern city of Ponce in 1974, and raised in Isla Verde, in the San Juan metropolitan area, Pedro Julio's biological father left shortly after he was born. The second of four brothers, he was raised by his mother Alicia Burgos and her husband of 30 years, Hector Mujica, who Pedro Julio now calls his father. Burgos and Mujica say their son has been defending people, asking questions, and fighting for justice from a very young age.

The grandson of journalist who fought injustice through his reportage, Pedro Julio initially pursued a degree in media at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras. But at the age of 19, after having unprotected sex with his first sexual partner, Pedro Julio tested positive for HIV.

""He knew, but he didn't tell me,"" Pedro Julio said. ""But you know, I take responsibility for it, I have to.""

On the same day that Pedro Julio came out as gay to his parents, he also told them that he had HIV.

""The gay thing, I didn't care about. I only cared about the health of my child. It's impossible for a mother to think that her son will die before [she will, and it was very hard. It was hard because of the HIV, not because of the gay thing,"" Burgos said. ""It was a shock, I won't deny it.""

And so Pedro Julio dropped out of school, unable to balance his school work and his recent discovery. From there, he entered the world of activism and politics, working to promote awareness and fair treatment of the LGBT community on a not-so-receptive island.

The incident with Pedro Julio's blue Oldsmobile wouldn't be the first, or the last threat on his life. A couple of months after the unsolved crime (most crimes in Puerto Rico go unsolved), Pedro Julio was followed by a pickup truck, and narrowly escape the four men with shotguns that pursued him.

""Their intent was to scare me, and it worked,"" Pedro Julio said. ""I was terrified.""

On a third occasion, Pedro Julio was followed through winding streets and back alleys by yet another car in San Juan while with his mother was in the car. To this day, Burgos believes that her son is risking his life with his work. As a mother, she has tried to convince him that sticking his neck out isn't worth it.

""A lot of times I say to him, 'Please, go slow,' but you know I talk to him about it, and he always turns me around,"" she said. ""I leave understanding what he's doing, and that's his life, and that's what he wants to do and I'll respect him for that and I'll back him all the way.""

Burgos says she feels relieved that her son moved to New York City ten years ago, where he works as a spokesperson for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, because he's less subject to be a target of the widespread anti-gay violence on the island.

But that doesn't mean Pedro Julio doesn't return periodically to stir up controversy.

Kissing the Hate Away

When I visited Pedro Julio in his office, a yellowed newspaper cover hung on the wall behind him.

The image of Pedro Julio kissing Steven Toledo, his then-boyfriend, spread across the front page and the caption read, ""Amor gay sacude al Capitolio"" or ""Gay love shakes the Capitol."" Pedro Julio, wearing a white suit, eyes-closed, and Steven, head-angled to the side, were caught in a momentary kiss, which occurred while Pedro Julio was attending a hearing on civil unions on the island. The two men say they were aware that the act of kissing would cause controversy, but felt that it was being true to who they are to kiss in public.

""There was a tacit understanding that we're in the public eye,"" Toledo told me. ""But we wanted to be who we are consistently, as part of maintaining our integrity, and so we kissed normally.""

The front page cover, which scandalized a conservative Puerto Rico at the time and upset some even with the pro-gay movement for being ""too extreme,"" might seem distinctly conventional for anyone who has lived in an LGBT-friendly city in recent years.

""People told me we were moving too fast, that we were doing the movement a big disservice,"" he said.""But it was just a kiss.""

Pedro Julio's controversial tactics have brought him dear friends, as well as outspoken enemies.

He receives dozens of messages of love and solidarity from his many ardent supporters, including celebrities like singer Ricky Martin and Rene Perez Joglar of Calle 13. A text from his 19-year old brother Antonio that said he'd stand by his brother through anything, moved Pedro Julio to tears as he read it aloud to me at his desk.

Pedro Julio must also face those who despise him, and cope with a constant barrage of bullying through the very same means which has empowered his movement.

""Muerete, marica,"" read one tweet directed towards Pedro Julio and myself last month after I tweeted an article about the La Comay controversy. Translation: ""Go kill yourself, fag.""

But not all of Pedro Julio's opponents are anonymous homophobes on Twitter. One Puerto Rican blogger Emmanuel Serrano Hernández, who blogs under the moniker Gazoo Starr, is an outspoken critic of the activist.

He wrote a blog earlier this month called ""Un peligro para todos"" (Translation: A danger for everyone), which is a play on the name of Pedro Julio's organization which advocates human rights on the island called ""Un Puerto Rico para todos."" The post received more than 2,000 likes on Facebook, and prompted the creation of a Facebook and Twitter accounts called Boycott Pedro Julio, which each have over one thousand followers.

In his post, Hernandez sticks with some of the most popular critiques of Pedro Julio. Hernandez says that Pedro Julio actually censors free speech, that he purports to speak for an entire Puerto Rico, even though he speaks for a small minority, that he craves media-attention, that he doesn't even live on the island that he seeks to influence, and that he's an indiscriminate complainer.

""What happened here was victory of the censorship by a few, lead by the hysterical Pedro Julio Serrano,"" Starr wrote. ""Pedro Julio, you don't represent me nor do you represent Puerto Rico, and you especially don't represent us residing in New York and coming here to complain and brag.""

Pedro Julio's closest friends say he is misunderstood by some Puerto Ricans who only see Pedro Julio amidst controversy. He appears on radio shows, talk shows, and is quoted almost daily in the island's biggest newspapers, fighting against the powers that be.

But for those who know him well, Pedro Julio's private persona is much less serious. He's a laugher, a prankster, and a charmer, his close friends say. He especially loves scaring his mother, most recently by pretending he was a ghost.

One of his best friends, Karlo Karlo, a makeup artist and gay rights activist in New York City, says that Pedro Julio can get anyone on his side, if he's given the chance.

When Pedro Julio was seated next to two conservative women in their late sixties from ""el campo,"" or rural Puerto Rico, last year at a dinner at a close friends' house in San Juan, Karlo Karlo says that at first tensions were high.

""These two ladies were very very religious. They were evangelical, and they only knew Pedro Julio from seeing him on television,"" Karlo Karlo said. ""But by the end of the night, were all laughing so hard. I mean, we were all truly having fun, and these two ladies loved Pedro Julio. They just couldn't get enough of him.""

By the end of the night, the women were converts.

""'Pedro Julio, sabes que en realidad tu eres un muchacho muy bueno. Es que siempre te veo peleando en la television,"" one woman told him, according to Karlo Karlo. (Translation: Pedro Julio, you know what you're actually a very good man. It's just that I always see you fighting on the television.)

Since the dinner, the two women have continued to ask for Pedro Julio to visit, and when they returned to el campo they shared with their fellow lady-friends what they believed was Pedro Julio's biggest secret of all -- he's a closeted nice guy.

Pedro Julio's life hasn't been easy. He had a heart condition as a child which would cause him to faint, he survived cancer at the age of 36, he was hospitalized after collapsing from exhaustion at 38, and for the last two decades he's had to deal with the realities of living with HIV.

Still, Serrano is perfectionist, a micro-manager, and a ""work-horse,"" as he terms it. Despite a compromised immune system, Pedro Julio routinely goes 24, 36, and even 40 hours without sleeping. To his frustration, his body often gives out before he does.

""I've had to learn that I'm human,"" Pedro Julio said. Pedro Julio's struggles have lead him to realize how short life is, and has made him impatient to finish his work and spread his message.

""I'm very impatient. I feel desperate to finish already. I always want to accelerate the pace of things,"" he said. ""I just want to convince everyone. I feel like if I just talk to someone, I can convince them.""

His boyfriend, and his mother, have tried to step in, but Pedro Julio doesn't like hearing it.

""He has HIV, you know, and he's always been delicate with his health, so I'm always concerned,"" his mother said. ""He gets exhausted physically and emotionally, and I told him he needs to slow down, but he won't. Nobody can stop him.""

Pedro Julio's work habits have taken a toll on other people in his life including his future husband Steven. The couple broke up for nearly two years because Toledo felt that Pedro Julio wasn't able to balance the activism with the relationship. But they both say they're happier than ever, and that they're working hard to make it work.

Although the two work in LGBT advocacy, there's are a number of ways they don't see eye-to-eye. Steven, a Bronx-native, loves wilderness and hiking. Pedro Julio doesn't. But part of working on their relationship means that Pedro Julio has agreed to take more camping expeditions.

""I just need access to a bathroom, a shower, and a place to charge my phone, and to be connected with what's going on in the world,"" Pedro Julio said. They also have vastly different dietary habits. Pedro Julio describes Toledo as ""almost vegan"" and Toledo says Pedro Julio ""runs away from anything green."" The couple is getting married in New York in the next year and planning to have a child through a surrogate. If it's a boy, he'd be named Gianmarco, but the girl's name remains subject for debate.

I met up with Pedro Julio in his neighborhood in Jackson Heights, where the couple lives with their mean little dog Coqui, named after Puerto Rico's national frog, and their kind golden retriever puppy named Ralph. Pedro Julio took me to a Uruguayan restaurant where, true to form, we ate nearly a dozen varieties of grilled meat. He interrupted the meal only to respond to tweets from a handful of Puerto Rican politicians and conduct a quick radio interview.

After finishing our parillada, he told me he is planning to move back to Puerto Rico with his new family next year, and ""won't rule out"" a 2016 run for political office of some sort. ""Actually, I'm considering it,"" Pedro Julio said, with a flash of his white smile. He declined to go into further detail.

A Politician, An Activist, A Teacher

Above all, Pedro Julio is a teacher, his closest friend, Karlo Karlo said. Nearly every Facebook post, blog, and tweet that Pedro Julio shares has a moral to it. His favorite phrases repeat messages of peace and harmony: ""Human dignity is inalienable,"" ""Equality is inevitable,"" ""With solidarity and respect for all.""

""He teaches us all so much,"" Karlo Karlo said. When he told Pedro Julio's father that his son was a teacher, Karlo Karlo says he'll never forget how he was corrected.

""Pedro Julio is not teaching people,"" Mujica told him. ""He's unteaching them and that is much harder.""",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/nypd-spied-american-muslims-nations-top-universities/story?id=18430058,"Almost exactly a year ago, the Associated Press obtained a declassified document revealing that the New York City Police Department monitored student activities of Muslim Student Associations (MSA) in at least 15 colleges across the northeast, including at some of the nation's top schools, like Yale University and UPenn.

On Monday, civil rights lawyers filed a lawsuit against the NYPD for routinely observing Muslims in restaurants, mosques and cafes without due cause -- practices which were uncovered in a series by the AP. Lawyers argue that the widespread surveillance of the Muslim communities violates a 1985 court decision and are seeking a court order against further surveillance of Muslims without evidence of wrongdoing as well as a new court-appointed overseer of police espionage activities.

When the declassified document came out last February, it sent a chill through the Ivy Muslim Conference, a gathering of 130 Muslim students that was taking place at Yale that weekend. In a large dining hall, the AP story circulated quietly on dozens of iPhones and BlackBerries.

""The first reaction of most students was just utter shock of being spied on when you haven't done anything wrong,"" said Omer Bajwa, the current Chaplain of Muslim Life at Yale. ""And then came fundamental questions about why they are spying on us.""

Bajwa said that Yale's MSA would be classified as ""moderate to liberal"" on scales used by some in the field to evaluate religious fundamentalism.

""Here is this group of well-intentioned, moderate Muslims, the farthest category of people from those the NYPD should be concerned about, and now we have to defend ourselves from the terrorism insinuation that comes with that news,"" Bajwa said. ""We felt insulted, and humiliated, but also very perplexed.""

The document obtained by the AP revealed that the NYPD tracked Muslim student websites and blogs daily and sent at least one undercover officer to monitor a white water rafting trip with students from the City College of New York. The surveillance occurred almost 6 years ago, and is said to have discontinued, but the paranoia that it may still be happening remains.

Bajwa said that students were fearful in the weeks following the news, approaching him to discuss the possibilities of there being informants in their classes who would misconstrue their words. Others, like women who wear head-coverings, expressed fear that they would be targets of islamophobia because the recent news would insinuate some sort of guilt on their part, he said.

Although Yale's President Rick Levin stood up in defense of Yale's Muslim study body, arguing that ""police surveillance based on religion, nationality, or peacefully expressed political opinions is antithetical to the values of Yale, the academic community, and the United States,"" few other non-Muslims leaders or public figures publicly opposed the surveillance of MSA students.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended his program against Levin's attacks in an interview with the AP.

""If going on websites and looking for information is not what Yale stands for, I don't know.... It's the freedom of information ... Of course we're gonna look at anything that's publicly available and in the public domain. We have an obligation to do so. And it is to protect the very things that let Yale survive,"" Bloomberg said.

The NYPD denies participating in any activities that violate the constitutional rights of Muslim Americans, and says they do not run surveillance operations indiscriminately. Still, an AP interview with a former paid informant who said he was paid to 'bait' innocent Muslims into making incendiary statements directly countered the NYPD's claims.

The most senior intelligence chief in the NYPD, David Cohen, said that he wanted an informant in every mosque ""within a 250-mile radius"" of the city, according to AP reports.

""Take a big net, throw it out, catch as many fish as you can and see what we get,"" one investigator, quoted by the AP, recalled Cohen saying.

Glenn Katon, the legal director of Muslim Advocates, an organization devoted to protecting Muslim civil liberties, says that the news of the large surveillance structure has put the entire Muslim community on edge in the Northeast, for fear they are being watched at every turn.

""Somehow in our country we've come to accept discrimination in our country against Muslims as okay, because a very tiny handful of people committed terrible acts,"" Katon said. ""But all kinds of people do all kinds of crazy things, even sometimes in the name of religion, and yet we don't use that to persecute an entire religion the way we have with Muslims.""

However, supporters of the NYPD surveillance program say that singling out Muslims is an unfortunate side effect of fighting a real war on terror.

""Some of the most dangerous Western Al Qaeda-linked [or] inspired terrorists since 9/11 were radicalized [or] recruited at universities in MSAs,"" Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman told the New York Times at the time.

The late Edward Koch, former Mayor of New York City, echoed Browne's words in an editorial in March.

""The people living in New York City are entitled to protection from terrorists, whoever they are. Today, they are overwhelmingly, indeed nearly exclusively, Islamic terrorists seeking to destroy Western civilization,"" he wrote.

But, according to most recent estimates, this common conception isn't quite right. Sixty-one percent of the 337 people indicted for terrorism-related activities in the 10 years following 9/11 attacks were jihadists, and the remainder subscribed to unrelated ideologies, including white supremacy and extreme anti-government school of thought, according to recent data collected by the New America Foundation. Since 9/11, more people have died in terrorist attacks in the U.S. that were motivated by other ideologies that have nothing to do with jihadist principles, than those that were, the data set indicates.

CNN's National Security Analyst Peter Bergen argues these numbers ""suggest enforcement's tendency to regard Muslim-American communities as the most likely source of terrorism risks missing the threat from other extremists."" Check out Bergen's full breakdown here.

Recent controversy regarding the surveillance program is part of a larger debate over whether the erosion of privacy rights will lead to increased safety. In the more than six years of spying on Muslims, the NYPD's former unit devoted to surveilling Muslim Americans never generated a lead or brought about a terrorism investigation, the department admitted in August of last year.

Nafez Al Dakkak, a Palestinian from Jordan, graduated from Yale two years ago. There, he won the award for the best senior essay in the International Studies major. Now working in Amman for an education NGO, Al Dakkak professes that he's ""in love with a lot of what America stands for domestically"" despite his grievances with some of their foreign policy and for their treatment of Muslims at home.

""As an international college student, all I wanted to do was fit in, feel part of the U.S. and what it stands for. It's a great country,"" he wrote in an email. But Al Dakkak, like many of his fellow Muslim students, was aware the government was watching him carefully.

""I was fully aware that I was under surveillance at Yale. The way I was treated at JFK [Airport] left very little doubt,"" he said. Al Dakkak says he was placed on a special post-9/11 list called NSEERS based on Homeland Security formula of potential threats. Every time he flew back to Yale from summer break he would endure a 3-hour wait and interview process at the airport. The NSEERS program was ended last year after ""input from community community groups and advocacy organizations.""

""It got so bad they even made me give them all my credit card numbers. I'm not sure what they did with any of that information or if they ever thought of me as a serious suspect. I must say though it was very confusing and at times, demeaning,"" he said.

Al Dakkak says his parents asked him not to pray in public and not to identify himself as Muslim, so as not draw any added attention to himself. Despite his worries, Al Dakkak made Yale his home and came to love the U.S. and the friends he made there.

""But the officers at JFK never failed to remind me that I wasn't really welcome in the country,"" he said.

Some supporters of the NYPD program, which is said to have discontinued on college campuses, say that if the Muslim American students aren't doing anything wrong, then the extra surveillance shouldn't bother them.

Mostafa Al-Alusi, the President of the Yale MSA, says this an argument he's seen too often on internet comment sections, and its one with which he strongly disagrees.

""Just the fact that we were chosen by the NYPD makes the American public think that something must be up and that could cause real harm in the Muslim community in the future,"" said Al-Alusi in reference to the dramatic rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes. In 2010 and 2011 combined there were more than 300 documented cases of such crimes.

The paranoia of being watched also adds another level of stress for Muslim students, Al-Alusi says. Wondering who might be gathering information, which of your words could be misconstrued and how that information could be used in the future is a constant worry for some students, he said.

Al-Alusi also believes that if the NYPD really wants to fight terrorism effectively, they would do well to partner with students like those Muslim students at Yale rather than spy on them.

""You're not going to find more thoroughly American Muslims than the Muslims at American universities,"" said Al-Alusi, a San Diego native whose parents are Iraqi.

""If the NYPD or any branch of government wants to understand how we think, or how other Muslims think, they should talk to us, we are a resource for them, we want to help them. They shouldn't presume a relationship of distrust.""",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/prosecutor-mark-hasse-killing-reward-raised/story?id=18387111,"State and federal authorities have upped the reward for information leading to the killers of Texas prosecutor Mark Hasse to $70,000, but today said they do not have a motive or suspects in Thursday's shooting outside the Kaufman County Courthouse.

Authorities confirmed they are combing through past cases handled by the assistant district attorney for a possible motive, but said they knew of no current cases that Hasse had been handling that involved the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, one of the nation's most violent prison gangs.

Hasse was shot Thursday just before 9 a.m. by one or two unknown assailants as he walked from his car to the courthouse in the small town of Kaufman southeast of Dallas.

READ: Texas Prosecutor's Killer Had Faces Covered

The assailants, who may have been masked and dressed in black, fled the scene in a silver four-door sedan. The murder came the same morning that two members of the ABT pleaded guilty to racketeering in a Texas federal court.

On Thursday morning, the Dallas Morning News reported that ""authorities with knowledge of the assistant DA's caseload [said] he had been heavily involved in the investigation of members of the Aryan Brotherhood.""

The Kaufman County DA's office, where Hasse and a dozen other ADAs worked, was listed as one of 22 agencies on the task force that handled the racketeering case.

In a press conference Friday, Kaufman County Police Chief Chris Albaugh said that it ""seems to be a coincidence"" that the two events happened on the same morning and called a link between the guilty pleas and the shooting ""speculation,"" but did not rule out the possibility that the shooting was related to one of Hasse's cases.

""We're not ruling out any involvement until we know,"" Albaugh said. ""And we have no specific information that the Aryan Brotherhood is a factor here.

""We are reviewing Mr. Hasse's cases and following up on any leads within those cases that would give us a person of interest,"" he said.

Hasse, 57, had been a longtime felony prosecutor for the Dallas County District Attorney's Office, according to the ABC's Dallas/Fort Worth affiliate WFAA-TV. He headed the organized crime unit in Dallas in the 1980s. He started work in Kaufman County three years ago.

Aryan Brotherhood of Texas

Ben Dillon, AKA Tuff, and James Meldrum, AKA Dirty, both 40 and members of the ABT, pleaded guilty to racketeering Thursday in Houston and could be sentenced to life in prison. Dillon admitted trafficking methamphetamine and committing arson, while Meldrum admitted beating another gang member and selling meth.

Meldrum and Dillon were among nearly three dozen defendants charged late last year with racketeering for the ABT. The federal indictment includes charges of racketeering, meth dealing, kidnapping and murder against defendants with nicknames like ""Scuba Steve,"" ""Duke,"" ""Baby Huey,"" and ""Bam Bam.""

Another member of the ABT, Terry Sillers, is reportedly under the protection of federal agents after agreeing to cooperate with authorities and testify against the 34 defendants in the case.

The Anti-Defamation League calls the ABT ""the most violent extremist group in the United States today"" and one of the largest white supremacist prison gangs in the country. Since 2000, according to the ADL, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas and its associates have committed at least 29 murders in Texas and neighboring states, killing ""more Americans than any other domestic extremist group.""

Most of the murders seem to be the result of criminal or internal disputes rather than hate crimes, however. Some of the killings involved torture, burning and decapitation.

The ABT is allegedly involved in methamphetamine trafficking and identity theft, among other crimes. It is separate from the better-known national group, the Aryan Brotherhood.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/hate-crime-charges-allegedly-stealing-mentally-disabled/story?id=18294194,"A Philadelphia woman and four others face a first of its kind hate crimes prosecution for allegedly imprisoning mentally handicapped adults in a basement while stealing their benefit checks.

The 196 count federal grand jury indictment unsealed today claims that Linda Ann Weston, 52, and her alleged accomplices preyed on people with mental disabilities from 2001 to 2011 when four adults were found confined in her Philadelphia basement.

""Shocking does not begin to describe the criminal allegations in this case where the victims were tied-up and confined like zoo animals and treated like property akin to slaves,"" U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Zane Memeger said in a statement.

The case will be the first to utilize a 2009 statute that enhanced punishments for criminals who target the mentally disabled. Weston is accused of targeting mentally disabled people in order to steal their Social Security disability payments.

Investigators in Philadelphia said in 2011 that Weston and her accomplices were carrying out a ""widespread fraud scheme,"" and that they trafficked the victims from Texas to Florida to Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, they held their alleged victims in Weston's daughter's apartment building.

The victims are believed to have been in the 6 by 10 foot boiler room for about 10 days. They were found in October 2011 reeking of excrement from the bucket they were forced to use, police said.

According to the indictment, one of the victims, who have not been named, was Weston's niece.

Weston allegedly targeted mentally disabled individuals who were estranged from their families and offered them a place to stay. In some instances Weston pretended to have a romantic interest in her victims as a means of luring them into her home, the indictment states.

Once she had convinced them to move in, Weston became their representative payee with Social Security and began to collect their disability benefits, according to the indictment. At times two women were forced to engage in prostitution, and when victims attempted to flee they were beaten, kicked and burned, court documents state.

When police searched personal belongings of Weston in 2011, documents belonging to 50 persons turned up, authorities said. The documents allegedly included drivers licenses, Social Security cards and even power of attorney forms filled out to allow Weston access to the victims' money.

After discovering the documents, police launched an investigation, believing that she may have had victims in Florida, Virginia and Texas.

The indictment unsealed today names Weston, Eddie Wright, 52, of Killeen, Texas, Gregory Thomas Sr., 49, of Philadelphia, Weston's daughter Jean Mcintosh, 33, of Philadelphia, and Nicklaus Woodard, 26, of West Palm Beach, Fla.

All five were charged with four counts of a hate crime, conspiracy, racketeering, and kidnapping. Weston Mcintosh and Thomas were charged with involuntary servitude. Only Weston was charged with two counts of murder.

Confinement and abuse caused the deaths of two other victims, the prosecutors allege and Weston worked to cover up their deaths.

All five of the defendants in the case face life sentences.",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/US/teens-planned-bomb-plot-school-hate-crime/story?id=18147782,"A 17-year-old, self-proclaimed white supremacist will be arraigned today in what police say was a plot to attack fellow students at his high school in Russell County, Ala., with homemade explosive devices.

Derek Shrout was arrested Friday after a teacher at Russell County High School found what appears to be the teen's journal and contacted authorities. Police said the journal contained plans to kill six students and one teacher with homemade grenades. Six of the seven individuals were black.

In the journal, police say that Shrout thought the white male on his list was gay.

""That's the reason the white male was on the list. It screams hate crime,"" Russell County Sheriff Heath Taylor said.

Investigators say Shrout started writing in his journal just three days after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14.

""The journal contained several plans that looked like potential terrorist attacks and attacks of violence and danger on the school,"" Taylor said.

Shrout told police that the journal was a work of fiction.

""I didn't think anything like that could happen in Russell County. I thought maybe that's just something that happens everywhere else,"" said student Qunitin Hobbs.

Shrout told police that he rarely interacted with the people he's accused of targeting. Police say Shrout learned how to make the devices on the Internet.

A search of Shrout's home turned up dozens of empty tobacco containers filled with shrapnel. The containers had holes in them ready for fuses to ignite. He hadn't obtained gunpowder, fuses or a substance to ignite the devices.

""He could have got the whole school, just got all of us at once,"" said student Javon Rogers.

Shrout is expected to plead not guilty in his court appearance later today. The teen is being charged as an adult with attempted assault.

http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/puerto-rico-introduces-guidelines-hate-crimes/story?id=18084938,"At least 18 members of Puerto Rico's LGBT community were murdered in 2010 and 2011 alone. But to the frustration of many gay rights activists, no killings or assaults targeting members of the LGBT community have ever been classified as hate crimes, according to Pedro Julio Serrano, a spokesperson for the U.S.-based National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

But things could change. On Thursday, Puerto Rico's Secretary of Justice Guillermo Somoza, in the last press conference of his term, announced that new protocol for the processing and sentencing of hate crimes would be put in place, the Puerto Rican newspaper Primera Hora reported.

Although Somoza did not offer detailed plans, he did note that the new initiative is partially a product of meetings with LGBT groups in recent years. The protocol will reportedly guide authorities and prosecutors in determining whether or not a particular incident meets the requirements to be investigated as a hate crime, and provide law enforcement agents with clear steps to take when identifying evidence.

Serrano calls the new guidelines ""too little, too late.""

""We've been trying to get this protocol in place for over three years and finally, in the last month of their tenure, they finally unveil it,"" Serrano said, referring to administration of Gov. Luis Fortuño, who lost a re-election bid to Alejandro García Padilla in November.

Last year, the Justice Department issued a report condemning Puerto Rico for its rampant police corruption. Among the stated grievances, the report found that law enforcement needed ""to improve its handling and investigation of hate crimes, particularly crimes against individuals in the LGBT community."" Legislatively, things moved in the opposite direction: In the same year, the commonwealth's legislature considered stripping protections for LGBT individuals from hate crime law that had been in place since 2002.

The action was condemned by a number of prominent members of the Puerto Rican community, including Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and singer Ricky Martin.

""They ought to do their homework and review a little the Universal Declaration of Human Rights...which says that everyone -- the citizens -- are equal before the law and have, without distinction, the right to equal protection under the law,"" Martin posted on his website last year.

Critics of the measure, which did not pass, say that anti-gay sentiments are commonplace on the island and that the lack of protections for the LGBT community only reinforces such discrimination.

Francheska Gonzalez, a transsexual who reportedly suffered broken vertebrae and a ruptured right breast implant during a beating in April 2011, told UPI last year that the legislative move was part of a growing segment of Puerto Ricans that promote hatred towards the gay community.

""A lot of church people are not teaching peace and to love thy neighbor,"" Gonzalez said. ""They are teaching to hate gays.""

While the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force's Serrano is frustrated with how long it took for the hate crime protocol to be instated, he called it ""a step in the right direction.""

""We look forward to working with the new administration to make sure that hate crimes are investigated and prosecuted as such,"" Serrano wrote in an email.

The Governor-elect Alejandro Garcia Padilla has vowed to work to combat anti-LGBT violence in his coming term. In a speech he gave to the LGBT community before the election, Padilla insisted that he'd help fight such injustices on the island. He even closed by echoing a famous line from Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in the United States.

""My name is Alejandro Garcia Padilla,"" he said in Spanish, ""And I'm here to recruit you.""",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Politics/petition-seeks-label-westboro-baptist-church-hate-group/story?id=18082959,"A growing number of people want to designate the Westboro Baptist Church as a hate group.

The Kansas-based church gained notoriety for protesting military funerals with anti-gay messages, and threatened to protest the recent funerals of the young Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims.

More than 280,000 people have signed a digital petition on the White House's website requesting that the church be labeled a hate group, well above the number needed to mandate a response from the Obama administration. According to The Huffington Post, the petition is the single most popular petition ever created through the White House's ""We the People"" site.

See Also: Obama Responds to Petitions Calling for End of Gun Violence

The petition was submitted on December 14, the day the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre occurred. The shooting also sparked gun control petitions on the same site, which generated enough support to prompt the White House to release a video of President Obama calling for increased gun control.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) handles some individual hate crimes, but it does not keep a public list of hate groups. However, several groups, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, have already labeled the church a hate group, and the FBI's website lists the center as a resource. The center defines a hate group as one that has ""beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.""

Several other petitions calling for action against the church have also generated at least 25,000 signatures, the number needed to warrant a response from the Obama administration. Some petitions request that the organization's tax-exempt status be revoked.

The church is best known for picketing military funerals. While the Obama administration has not specifically outlawed Westboro from doing so, the president signed a bill in August that prevents protesters from coming within 300 feet of military funerals and prohibits protests two hours before or after a service.

The charges that were filed against Jennings after he allegedly pulled a pen knife out of his briefcase over a disagreement with driver Mohamed Ammar about cab fare were dropped in October. However, he was fired about two weeks prior to the ruling for breaching Morgan Stanley's code of conduct, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Jennings and his attorney did not immediately return a request for comment. An unnamed spokesman for Jennings told the Journal: ""The issue is not Mr. Jennings' conduct. The issue is Morgan Stanley's conduct. Morgan Stanley knew Mr. Jennings was victimized and still fired him and still kept his money.""

A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley provided a statement:

""While we cannot comment on specific instances or individuals, the claw back provisions in our compensation model allow us to take action where appropriate when an employee engages in conduct that is detrimental to the firm, including conduct that causes damage to the firm's franchise and reputation, or creates a situation in which the Firm suffers losses or is exposed to excessive financial or regulatory risks.""

The Wall Street Journal notes that Jennings earned $3 million or more, citing people familiar with the matter, and that Morgan Stanley has refused to give him some of his compensation of as much as $5 million. The payments are the subject of discussions between the firm and Jennings' attorney, the Journal reported.

Meanwhile, Hassan Ahmad, attorney for Ammar, said the taxi driver has retained his law firm to pursue civil charges against Jennings.

The incident began after a Morgan Stanley holiday party in New York City on Dec. 21. Jennings' town-car service didn't show up so he got into a cab for a 40-mile ride home to Darien, Conn., according to court documents.

On arrival, Jennings wanted to negotiate a lower price for the fare and he said Ammar asked for $294. Ammar said he asked for $204.

Ammar locked the doors and said he wanted the police to settle the dispute whereas Jennings thought he was being abducted because Ammar ran stop signs and said they were returning to New York, according to police reports.

Jennings pulled out his pen knife and the men brawled in the cab about a mile from Jennings' home. Jennings ran home but later came forward after news reports were published about the incident. He was arrested on Feb. 29 and charged with second-degree assault.

Ammar's right hand was cut and required six stitches.

New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said today that the department will ask the FBI for a profiler to help identify who might have killed these three people -- and, in a prepared statement Supervisory Special Agent Martin Feely of the FBI's New York office said the bureau would be providing that help.

""The FBI will be providing assistance, to include expertise from the Behavioral Analysis Unit,"" Feely said. ""The New York Police Department remains the lead investigative agency.""

Rahmatollah Vahidipour, an Iranian Jew, was killed inside the She She boutique in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn on Friday night, sustaining three gunshot wounds to the head and torso. The 78-year-old's body was dragged to the back of the store and covered with merchandise, WABC reported.

Police said that shell casings from the gun match the casings found at two other murder scenes this summer.

In addition, the killings were within a five mile radius of each other, each occurred at a small shop that lacked security cameras and each victim was over 50, police said. It was also not clear whether the victims were robbed.

Vahidipour's body was discovered in his boutique at 7:11 p.m. The four people caught on video in the vicinity of the area between 6 p.m. and 6: 52 p.m. on Friday are not considered suspects in the crime, police said.

""Detectives want to question them about what they may have observed because of the time of day and their proximity to the homicide scene,"" Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said in a statement.

Police said that two of the potential witnesses, a man and a woman, were captured on video Friday evening running one after the other south on Flatbush Avenue, a half block south of the crime scene. The woman can be seen taking off her green jacket, which police said was later recovered in a nearby garbage can.

Police indicated they have a strong interest in talking to a white male seen carrying a duffle bag in one of several photos and a video they released.

Ballistic tests performed by the NYPD show that the gun used in Friday's homicide was also used in two recent south Brooklyn shooting deaths this summer.

Clothing store owner Mohamed Gebeli, an Egyptian Muslim, was killed inside Valentino Fashion in Bay Ridge on July 6. Gebeli was shot in the neck and was found with several pieces of clothing on top of him. Police said $383 in receipts was missing, but $1,500 was found inside a cabinet.

On Aug. 2, Isaac Kadare, a Jew who was of Egyptian descent, was found dead at the Amazing 99 Cents Deal store that he owned in Bensonhurst. Kadare had been shot in the temple and had three stab wounds to the neck. His face was covered with an aluminum tray and bleach had been splashed on his pants. It wasn't clear if anything had been taken from Kadare's store.

Police said they are not sure if the homicides were racially motivated.

State Sen. Eric Adams, a former New York City police officer, suggested Sunday that the string of homicides could be the work of a serial killer.

""We don't want the city to be engulfed in fear based on the actions of a potential serial killer who appears to be targeting men of Middle Eastern descent,"" Adams said. ""This person must be apprehended.""

Police said that no evidence has yet been recovered to indicate bias crime in Vahidipour's murder. Still, personnel from the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force were added Sunday to a group of detectives investigating the three homicides ""for their expertise.""

Former FBI agent and ABC News consultant Brad Garrett said the common thread between the three homicides could be that as shop owners working alone, they were all vulnerable.

""The question clearly is motive. It's going to be robbery, hate, or revenge,"" Garrett said. ""If the motive is robbery, a lot of violent robbers shoot the people they rob. If this is a hate crime, he went in there to do what he did, to kill the owner and have enough time to get away. If that's the case, I think it's reasonable to think all three of these guys were profiled previously.""

Rewards of $22,000 in each of the homicides are being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the crimes.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/husband-arrested-murder-iraqi-american-family-claimed-hate/story?id=17682675,"The husband of an Iraqi-American mother whose family called her death a hate crime was charged with homicide today, nearly eight months after his wife's murder.

Police arrested Kassim Alhimidi, 48, of El Cajon, Calif., Thursday for the murder of his 32-year-old wife, Shaima Alawadi, according to ABC News affiliate KGO.

Alawadi's family called her death a hate crime after she was found beaten in her living room with a note calling her ""a terrorist."" The murder sent shockwaves through El Cajon, which is home to one of the nation's largest concentrations of Iraqi immigrants.

Alawadi was found by her 17-year-old daughter, who said she and her mother were the only ones home on the morning of March 21, when she heard her mother squeal and the sound of glass breaking. She said she found her mother bloodied, with the note nearby, which also told the family ""to go home.""

Police said at the time that Alhimidi, the woman's husband, claimed to have been out of the house, taking the couple's younger children to school when the murder occurred.

Fatima Alhimidi, the 17-year-old who found Alawadi, told news reporters the crime must have been motivated by hatred. She said the family had received a similar note a week earlier in which they were told to go home to their own country but had dismissed it as a prank.

El Cajon police, however, said early on that although the possibility of a hate crime had been suggested to them, they believed it was an isolated incident and the area's Iraqi-American population should not fear similar crimes directed at it.

Alhimidi is now charged with first-degree murder for Alawadi's death, according to KGO.

Search warrants viewed by KGO revealed that divorce papers had been found in Alawadi's car but had not been filled out.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/louisiana-woman-roils-race-relations-fake-kkk-burning/story?id=17552287,"Race relations have been riled twice this week in a Louisiana town where police say a woman fabricated a violent KKK attack in which she ""self-inflicted"" burns on 60 percent of her body.

Sharmeka Moffitt, 20, called 911 around 8 p.m. on Sunday from a park in Winnsboro, La., to report that three men in white hoodies had doused her in liquid and set her on fire. A racial slur and ""KKK"" were written on her car. Police were at the scene within minutes of the call, but found no suspects.

The community rallied around Moffitt, who is in the hospital with severe burns, and several law enforcement agencies immediately joined together to pursue her alleged attackers.

But in a news conference on Tuesday, authorities said that Moffitt's fingerprints were found on a cigarette lighter and on a can of lighter fluid recovered nearby.

""I feel hurt for the victim because that could have been my child, my sister or my mother, so I'm frustrated about that,"" Winnsboro Police Chief Lester Martin said at the news conference.

Police did not immediately respond to request for comment today and have not said if Moffitt will be facing criminal charges.

Residents were angered by the fake and divisive attack.

""She had all these people believing that it was racial issues and everybody was hating everybody because of this,"" resident Ta'Nikqua Smith told ABC News' Shreveport affiliate KTBS. ""Nobody felt safe anymore.""

Alice Prescott, another resident, said that the news of the attack followed by the news of the attack's fraudulence has strained the community.

""I'm absolutely frustrated because of all of the tension that's been placed on everybody,"" she told KTBS.

Others expressed frustration with the cost of an investigation that involved numerous agencies.

""This has been a very disturbing case for everyone involved and it has involved multiple agencies and a lot of hard work,"" Franklin Parish Sheriff Kevin Cobb said at the news conference.

Moffitt is in critical condition at a Shreveport hospital. Her family has asked for privacy, but released a statement saying they were ""devastated to learn the circumstances surrounding our daughter's injuries.""

""We are sincerely sorry for any problems this may have caused and wish to express our appreciation for the outpouring of love, prayers and support we have received from friends, acquaintances, church organizations and government officials,"" the family wrote.

The family said they would be focusing on Moffitt and her recovery over the coming weeks.

Authorities reminded the community of how they rallied for Moffitt and encouraged them to continue doing so.

""When we felt it was an attack situation, our community was coming together,"" Cobb said. ""They were coming in to support her from all sides and we should continue to do that.""

This is not the first time someone has faked an allegedly hate crime.

Earlier this year, a Nebraska woman was arrested for faking an anti-gay hate crime in which she claimed three masked men bound her, cut words into her skin and spray-painted slurs on her wall before setting her house on fire.

Charlie Rogers, 33, had told police that the three assailants broke into her Lincoln, Neb., home on July 22.

Rogers, a lesbian and a former University of Nebraska women's basketball star, became a face for anti-gay hate crimes after the alleged attack. Reports of the alleged assault outraged the gay community, and hundreds of people participated in rallies outside the Nebraska capitol building, and at a park in Omaha.

Police charged Rogers with false reporting after disclosing evidence that contradicted her story and pointed to a faked attack.

Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate crimes, told ABCNews.com today, ""There's a real danger in the entire notion of hate crimes coming into question.""

""These kinds of reports, for whatever reason they are made, are incredibly destructive,"" Potok said. ""[They] cast into doubt the very real number of hate crimes that happen every day.""

About 200,000 hate crimes occur in the United States every year, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, with a ""vastly smaller number that turn out to be bogus.""

http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/hofstra-perfect-place-talk-immigration/story?id=17485393,"In both the first presidential debate in Denver and the vice presidential debate in Kentucky, questions to the candidates focused on foreign policy, the economy and healthcare.

Immigration -- a central topic in two Univision candidate forums last month -- didn't come up.

Why not?

""I guess the answer to that is the most pressing questions are those on the economy,"" said Rosanna Perotti, the chair of the Hofstra University political science department. ""Foreign policy came to the forefront the other day at the vice presidential debate but that's probably because one of the big questions about the Romney camp is whether it has enough expertise on foreign policy.""

This brings us to tonight's town hall presidential debate on Long Island, hosted by Hofstra University. In many ways, Long Island, America's first suburb, is the quintessential example of how the country is being shaped by Latino immigration. From 1990 to 2010, the Hispanic population on Long Island grew from roughly 165,000 to 442,000 -- a 167 percent increase. And Hispanics accounted for 16 percent of the total population in Nassau and Suffolk counties in 2010, exactly on par with the percentage of Hispanics nationwide.

So if there were ever a time and a place for the subject to come up, it should be tonight. Here are five reasons why.

1. A Lot of Immigrants Live There

You sometimes forget that Long Island starts where Queens, one of the most diverse places on earth, ends, and that the demographic richness carries over. Immigrants make up 16 percent of the population across the Island, and 19 percent of the population in Nassau County, according to a 2011 report by the Fiscal Policy Institute.

The top three sending countries across the island -- El Salvador, India and Italy -- account for 22 percent of Long Island immigrants, followed by immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Colombia, Jamaica, and Ecuador.

While Latino growth is notable on Long Island, the diverse makeup of immigrant groups makes it an ideal place to touch on national issues like the DREAM Act, visas for high-tech entrepreneurs and the immigration enforcement program, Secure Communities.

2. There's a History of Racial Tension

In November 2008, a group of seven teens from eastern Long Island attacked and killed Ecuadorian immigrant Marcelo Lucero. As it turned out, the attack wasn't a one-time occurrence. Members of the group had gone out ""beaner hopping"" -- slang they used for assaults against Latinos -- before that night.

Similarly, the string of attacks wasn't an isolated incident: the Southern Poverty Law Center chronicled dozens of reported incidents in a decade of violence against Latino immigration in the 2009 report ""Climate of Fear: Latino Immigrants in Suffolk County, N.Y.""

A question about hate crime may be unlikely, but it wouldn't be irrelevant. After the shooting this August at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, it's the kind of question the candidates should be answering.

3. It's a Local Political Wedge Issue

While less so in recent years, political rhetoric around immigration was common on Long Island throughout the 2000s.

One of the most vocal opponents of illegal immigration in the country was former Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy, a Democrat who became a Republican in 2010. During his tenure, he openly griped about the economic impact of people he referred to as ""anchor babies"" -- U.S.-born children of immigrants -- and backed a proposal to deputize police officers to enforce immigration law.

In 2011, Levy halted his campaign for a third term in office in order to stop an investigation into improper fundraising, surrendering more than $4 million in campaign funds as part of a deal with the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office.

The stage at Hofstra will provide an opportunity for both candidates to appeal to the Latino electorate. That means there won't be much room for negative or unrealistic solutions regarding illegal immigration. If anything, expect ""Hispandering.""

4. Their Economy Depends on Immigrants

Immigrants make up 16 percent of the population on Long Island, but account for 17 percent of its total economic output, according to ""New Americans on Long Island: A Vital Sixth of the Economy,"" a report by the Fiscal Policy Institute.

Immigrants open small businesses, as well: ""Of the 53,000 small businesses located on Long Island, 15,000 -- 22 percent -- are owned by immigrants, generating profits of $804 million,"" the report said, referencing a yearly average of profits from 2005 to 2009.

The economic impact of immigration could make for a great question. Congress has considered several bills opening up more visas for high-tech entrepreneurs and President Obama's deferred action program is letting young undocumented immigrants live and work in the U.S. The debate could be a chance to look at the impact.

5. Minority Groups Are Still Growing

While Long Island is considered one of the most segregated places in the country, minority communities are growing, spurred on by growth from immigrant groups. Latinos, blacks and Asians make up nearly 30 percent of the population on Long Island, but that hasn't necessarily translated to a voice in politics. That will be hard to avoid when this group makes up such a large part of the voting bloc.

According to the latest census data, the non-Hispanic white majority will end in 2042. That means that Long Island isn't the only region in the country where minority groups are growing, and where questions of education, healthcare, transportation and jobs will be at the forefront.

The economy and jobs will clearly be on the radar of the candidates tonight -- but the audience may surprise Romney and Obama with a question that not only asks about jobs, but about jobs for Latinos.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/arlen-specter-dies-us-senator-pennsylvania-dead-82/story?id=17470701,"Arlen Specter, the former senator from Pennsylvania who stunned both parties on Capitol Hill in 2009 when he announced he would switch his party allegiance to Democrat after 42 years as a Republican, has died. He was 82.

Specter died at his Philadelphia home from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Specter's battle with cancer has been long. In addition to the removal of a brain tumor, he was diagnosed and underwent chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease in 2005, only to undergo treatment again when it resurfaced in 2008.

He published a book, ""Never Give In: Battling Cancer in the Senate,"" about dealing with the disease after his initial diagnosis.

PHOTOS: Arlen Specter Through the Years

President Obama said Specter was ""always a fighter.""

""From his days stamping out corruption as a prosecutor in Philadelphia to his three decades of service in the Senate, Arlen was fiercely independent – never putting party or ideology ahead of the people he was chosen to serve. He brought that same toughness and determination to his personal struggles, using his own story to inspire others,"" Obama said in a statement.

In August, Specter announced he was ""battling cancer"" again -- this time with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

""I'm battling cancer. It's another battle I intend to win. I'm grateful for all the well wishes I've received. I'm looking forward to getting back to work, to the comedy stage, to the squash court and to the ballpark,"" Specter said in a statement released through his Philadelphia office, The Associated Press reported.

Last month, he was released from a Philadelphia hospital.

He is survived by his wife, Joan, and two sons, Shanin and Stephen.

Early Life

Born in Witchita, Kansas, in 1930, Specter was the youngest son of Lillie and Harry Specter, a Ukrainian immigrant. While in college, Specter said the Jewish family uprooted from Kansas and moved to Philadelphia when his sister came of age so she could find eligible bachelors of their faith.

After serving stateside with the Air Force during the Korean War, Specter returned to college to pursue a law degree at Yale.

He was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1956 and served as assistant district attorney of Philadelphia from 1959 to 1964.

Specter began his political career when he was appointed assistant counsel to the Warren Commission, the congressional body tasked with investigating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Recruited at the recommendation of then-Rep. Gerald Ford, Specter became one of the original proponents of the ""single bullet"" theory.

Specter wrote about that experience in his book, ""Passion for Truth: From Finding JFK's Single Bullet to Questioning Anita Hill to Impeaching Clinton,"" which was published in 2000.

In 1965, Specter was elected district attorney of Philadelphia, where he served two terms until his defeat in 1973. After failed bids for congress and the Pennsylvania governor's office, he eventually was elected to the Senate in 1981.

Specter's Political Career

In his three decades -- five terms -- in the Senate, Specter was a formidable presence on Capitol Hill, chairing three committees during his Senate career: the Intelligence, Judiciary, and Veterans Affairs committees.

Specter participated in 14 Supreme Court confirmation hearings and took leadership roles on legislation including the Armed Career Criminal Act, the Terrorist Prosecution Act, the Hate Crimes Act and legislation to expand Veteran's Rights, legislation to reform asbestos litigation, legislation for education and worker safety and the bill that created the Inspector General of the CIA.

In October 2002, Specter voted for authorizing the Iraq war.

In 2007, Time magazine honored him as one of ""America's 10 Best Senators,"" pointing to his legislative achievements and the help he provided in securing expanded funding for the National Institutes of Health.

A career moderate, as a Republican Specter had a long record of bucking his party even while in leadership positions. He was a sharp critic of President Bill Clinton's healthcare proposals and sought the GOP presidential nomination to run against him in 1996. But two years later he would go on to vote ""not proven"" during Clinton's impeachment hearings, believing the president had not received due process.

As Judiciary Committee chair in 2006, he called then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez to testify on the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping of U.S. citizens, a practice he openly criticized.

During the scandal the same year around the leaking of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity, Specter said President Bush, ""owes a specific explanation to the American people,"" over the circumstances, adding that even if ""the president may be entirely in the clear, and it may turn out that he had the authority to make the disclosures which were made, it was not the right way to go about it because we ought not to have leaks in government.""

Specter's Party Switch From Republican to Democrat

Besides his time spent on Capitol Hill, Specter may be best known for his 2009 party switch, which played a key role in helping President Obama get his flagship legislation though Congress.

Specter called his decision to switch from Republican to Democrat ""painful,"" and said he made the decision based on public and private polling in Pennsylvania that showed ""the prospects for winning a Republican primary [in Pennsylvania] are bleak.

""As the Republican party has moved farther and farther to the right, I have found myself increasingly at odds with the Republican philosophy and more in line with the philosophy of the Democratic Party,"" Specter said at the time..

Senate Republican leaders admitted they were unhappy losing a member, but argued that it had nothing to do with the national Republican Party rejecting moderates, but only with local Pennsylvania politics and Specter's desire for ""political self-preservation.""

In 2010, Specter lost the Democratic primary to then-U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak, who in turn lost the race to Republican Pat Toomey.

Specter supported the Obama administration's controversial American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- the stimulus -- and Wall Street reform as efforts to get the economy back on track after the collapse of 2008.

But perhaps most stinging to the Republican party, Specter's vote was the magic number 60th vote, to pass Obama's health care reform legislation in the Senate in December 2009.

In March of this year Specter spoke out about what he saw as the gridlock that has all-but paralyzed Congress this year.

""The cannibals have taken over and it has produced a gridlocked Senate and a dysfunctional government,"" Specter said in an interview with CBS News. ""Like cannibals eating their own, that's what's happening in Washington. ... You had a senator like Bob Bennett, with a 93 percent conservative rating, he cast one vote to support the bailout of the auto industry and he got dumped by the Republican Party.""

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., released the following statement today on Specter's passing:

""I was deeply saddened today to learn of the passing of Senator Arlen Specter. I served with Senator Specter in Congress for twenty-eight years. Senator Specter was a man of moderation; he was always passionate, but always easy to work with. I followed him through his previous illnesses, during the course of which he displayed great physical strength and great strength of character. Throughout his life, Senator Specter fought and won many battles, but this was one he could not win,"" Reid said in the statement. ""America is better today because of Arlen Specter. He will be dearly missed.""

After he left politics, Specter resumed his former career as an attorney, and served at his former alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, as an adjunct law professor.

He was even seen touring the Philadelphia comedy club circuit, jokingly lamenting over his days on the Hill, Bill Clinton, and former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/national-coming-day-moments-lgbt-history/story?id=17445009,"Twenty-five years ago today, half a million people participated in a historic march on Washington, D.C., for gay rights. Fired up from the march, organizers found a way to keep the march alive. The first National Coming Out Day was celebrated on Oct. 11, 1988. The goal of the day is for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their allies to celebrate coming out and encourage those who haven't to make their voices heard. ""It's a day to be visible,"" said Candace Gingrich-Jones, associate director of youth and campus outreach with the Human Rights Campaign. ""What we know today is people who know someone who is queer are much more likely to understand the issues of inequality and be supportive of the work to gain that equality,"" she said. On this 24th annual National Coming Out Day, click through to revisit the pivotal moments that shaped the gay rights movement.

1957: Frank Kameny Fights Back In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared homosexuals a threat to national security and ordered the immediate firing of every gay man and lesbian working for the U.S. government. Over the course of the McCarthy-era ""Lavender Scare,"" 5,000 government workers lost their jobs. Frank Kameny, an astronomer at the Army Map Service, was sent packing in 1957. Considered one of the founding fathers of the gay rights movement, Kameny fought back, taking his battle to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1961. His petition was denied but his actions helped bring visibility to the fight for equality. The federal government issued a formal apology to Kameny in 2009, more than half a century after he was fired for his sexual orientation. After decades of activism, Kameny passed away last year on National Coming Out Day at age 86.

1969: Stonewall Riots Early on the morning of June 28, 1969, New York City police raided the Stonewall Inn, a popular gay bar, to enforce a law banning homosexuality in public. This time, a fed-up crowd fought back, clashing with police in riots that lasted six days. The riots served as a catalyst for people around the country to organize in the push for equality and are heralded as the true beginning of the modern gay rights movement. Raymond Castro, who was arrested at the Stonewall Inn, shared his memories in the PBS documentary ""Stonewall Uprising"". ""All I know is, enough was enough,"" he said. ""You had to fight for your rights And I'm happy to say whatever happened that night, I was part of it. Because [at a moment like that] you don't think, you just act.""

1970: Gay Liberation Day March One year after the Stonewall Riots, the galvanized masses filled the streets of New York City again, this time marching in the first Gay Liberation Day parade. In San Francisco, an estimated 200 marked the day with a ""Gay-In"" at Golden Gate Park. Over the years, the marches spread to other cities in the U.S. and became an annual event, eventually taking on the name ""Gay Pride.""

arborwiki.org 1974: First Openly Gay Public Official In 1974, Kathy Kozachenko was elected to a seat on the Ann Arbor, Mich., city council, becoming the first openly LGBT candidate to win elected office in the United States. ""Kathy's election sparked the idea that our community could work for change not just as advocates outside legislative chambers, but as elected officials inside of government. She blazed the trail for better-known LGBT politicians like Elaine Noble, Harvey Milk, Barney Frank and Annise Parker, to name just a few,"" said Denis Dison, vice president of communications at the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a group committed to helping LGBT candidates win elected office. Later that year, Noble, an out lesbian, dodged bullets fired through her campaign windows to win election to the Massachusetts State House.

1977: Life and Death of Harvey Milk An icon of the American gay rights movement, Harvey Milk was one of the first openly gay men elected to office in the country when he was elected a city supervisor in 1977. In his 11 months in office, Milk was responsible for passing a landmark gay rights ordinance in the now famously gay-friendly city. He sponsored legislation to add an attachment to San Francisco's police code that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, housing and public accommodation. He also was a key figure in defeating a statewide bill that would have made the firing of gay teachers in California public schools mandatory. Just under a year into his tenure, Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated in San Francisco's City Hall by Dan White, a city supervisor with whom Milk had clashed. Milk's death made him a martyr in the gay community. That, coupled with White's conviction on voluntary manslaughter rather than a tougher charge, prompted the White Night riots and inspired the first 1979 National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. Milk was portrayed by Sean Penn in the Academy Award winning film ""Milk,"" and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.

1987: The Second Great March Hundreds of thousands of LGBT people and their supporters marched on Washington to demand equal rights and ask President Ronald Reagan to address the AIDS crisis. Actress Whoopi Goldberg, then presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, and Latino civil rights leader Cesar Chavez were among the estimated 500,000 people who descended on the capital. ""National Coming Out Day really happened because of the 1987 march on Washington,"" said Gingrich-Jones. ""After that, organizers had a summit to talk about the next steps. It was too easy for America to forget about its gay citizens. [That's when] the idea for National Coming Out Day was born.""

1997: Ellen: 'Yep, I'm Gay' Ellen DeGeneres was the star of her own eponymous sitcom when she made a shocking decision: coming out as a lesbian on the show, then on the cover of a national magazine. In the 1997 ""The Puppy Episode,"" DeGeneres' character Ellen comes out to her therapist, and an entire airport. The episode was a ratings success, but DeGeneres and the show faced criticism and backlash, and the show eventually ended after the next season. The same year her character came out, DeGeneres herself came out with the famous ""Yep, I'm Gay,"" Time magazine cover, and on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Despite initial backlash as the most visible openly lesbian celebrity, DeGeneres has had a highly successful career since 1997, hosting both the Emmys and the Academy Awards, starring in another sitcom, judging ""American Idol,"" and hosting her own award-winning talk show, ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show."" She has also become an outspoken advocate of a number of LGBT issues. Her coming out helped pave the way for other celebrities to be more open about their sexuality.

1998: Murder of Matthew Shepard The tortuous death of a gay 21-year-old college student helped shine a light on hate crime legislation at the state and federal levels. Shortly after midnight on Oct. 7, 1998, Matthew Shepard left a bar in Laramie, Wy., with two men who said they'd give him a ride home. Instead, Shepard, who was targeted because he was gay, was driven to the outskirts of town where he was beaten, robbed and tied to a fence. He was found 18 hours later by a bicyclist who had mistaken him for a scarecrow. Shepard spent five days in the hospital before succumbing to his injuries. Eleven years after his death, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crime Prevention Act was signed into law by President Barack Obama, making it a federal hate crime to assault a person based on their gender or perceived gender, sexual identity or sexual orientation.

2000: Civil Unions in Vermont Pave Way For Gay Marriage Civil unions become legal in Vermont, paving the way for gay marriage In 1999, Vermont's Supreme Court made a historic decision giving same-sex couples access to the same rights and benefits as heterosexual married couples. The state legislature followed in 2000 with a law creating legal civil unions for same-sex couples. The debate surrounding the passage of the legislation was highly contentious, but ultimately it passed, making Vermont the first state to allow same-sex civil unions. As of 2012, same-sex unions in some form (marriage, civil unions, etc.) have been legalized to some extent in Hawaii, Delaware, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia. Thirty-one states have constitutional amendments banning gay marriage, and voters in four states are set to vote on same-sex marriage this election.

2011: Repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' LGBT service members no longer had to hide their orientation when ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" was repealed on Sept. 20, 2011. The controversial policy, signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993, led to almost 13,000 service members' being discharged over its lifetime because of a ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military. ""To exclude one group of Americans from serving in the armed forces is contrary to our fundamental principles as outlined in the Declaration of Independence and weakens our defenses by denying our military the service of a large group of Americans who can help our cause,"" Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., said in 2010.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/son-real-housewives-miami-stars-charged-alleged-homeless/story?id=17453061,"The son of a ""Real Housewives of Miami"" star plans to plead not guilty to charges of simple battery for allegedly assaulting a homeless man, his lawyer said.

Peter Rosello, son of ""Real Housewives of Miami"" star Alexia Echevarria, was charged with simple battery with prejudice Wednesday, according to Miami Beach police. Due to hate crime law, his charges are a felony instead of a misdemeanor because the victim is homeless.

Rosello, of Miami Beach, Fla., turned himself into police Wednesday and was released on $5,000 bond.

Police discovered a YouTube video Oct. 3 showing the 20-year-old saying, ""Going to punch a hobo,"" before punching a sleeping man in the groin and running away.

""They don't know my son. My son has a huge heart,"" Echevarria told ABC affiliate WPLG. ""He's just a good kid who made the wrong choice at that time.""

Rosello's attorney, Richard Sharpstein, said he has yet to speak to the prosecutor but he told ABCNews.com Rosello's case could be affected by his mother's celebrity status.

""I think it's affected the case already in the sense that it's gotten a little bit more attention than it might have otherwise,"" he told ABCNews.com.

Echevarria expressed her son's remorse to WPLG.

""He's very sad about this, and, hopefully, we'll get through it, all the family, because everything else I have going on in my life,"" Echevarria told WPLG.

Miami Beach police reached out to the city's Homeless Outreach Teams who identified the homeless man to police as Gary Lee Brown. Brown, 62, told police the 20-year-old assaulted him for no apparent reason and he wanted to press charges.

Echevarria, who is the executive editor of Venue Magazine, said ""any mother could identify"" with the situation and she knows her status as a reality star has had an effect on it.

""You never think about this side and how unfortunate it is and how people -- the humanity -- they have this hate inside their heart,"" Echevarria told WPLG. ""They like this -- they like to see other families suffering. To me, that's the saddest think of this whole situation.""

Echevarria's ""Real Housewives of Miami"" bio on Bravo's website says the star ""admits she is at times more of an older sister than a disciplinarian to her two sons from a previous marriage."" ""The Real Housewives of Miami"" is in its second season.

Excerpted from MUGGED: RACIAL DEMAGOGUERY FROM THE SEVENTIES TO OBAMA by Ann Coulter by arrangement with Sentinel, an imprint of Penguin Group (USA), Inc., Copyright © Ann Coulter, 2012.

Chapter 1: Race Wars of Convenience, Not Necessity

The Democrats' slogan during the Bush years was: ""Dissent is patriotic."" Under Obama, it's: ""Dissent is racist.""

Liberals luxuriate in calling other people ""racists"" out of pure moral preening. They seem to imagine that in African American households throughout the land you'll find mantel portraits of Martin Luther King Jr., Robert Kennedy and Keith Olbermann. (More likely, those mantels would have portraits of Bernie Goetz.)

Beginning in the seventies, there was constant racial turmoil in this country, stirred up by the media, academia and Hollywood to promote their fantasy of America as ""Mississippi Burning.""

This was madness. There had been a real fight over civil rights for a century, especially in the previous two decades, but by the end of the sixties, it was over. Segregationist violence was gone, and all public places integrated. But in their minds, liberals lived in a heroic past, where they were the ones manning the barricades and marching against segregation. Liberals were hallucinating-about the present and the past.

Contrary to the myth Democrats told about themselves-that they were hairy-chested warriors for equal rights-the entire history of civil rights consists of Republicans battling Democrats to guarantee the constitutional rights of black people.

Not all Democrats were segregationists, but all segregationists were Democrats and there were enough of them to demand compliance from the rest of the party, just as today's Democrats submit to the demands of the proabortion feminists. The civil rights protests brought attention to injustice, and voters needed to know what was happening in the Democratic South. But the hoopla was unnecessary.

What really made the Democrats sit up and take notice was that blacks began voting, and would soon outnumber the Democrats' segregationist wing. That was accomplished by Thurgood Marshall winning cases in the Supreme Court, Republicans in Congress passing civil rights laws and Republicans in the White House enforcing both the court rulings and the laws-sometimes at the end of a gun.

Despite lingering hard feelings over the Civil War, Republican Dwight Eisenhower snatched large parts of the South from the Democrats in the 1952 presidential election. Boosted by his war record in the patriotic, military-admiring South, this Republican candidate carried Tennessee, Virginia, Florida and Texas-and he nearly won Kentucky, North Carolina and West Virginia, losing Kentucky by a microscopic .07 percent. The Democrats' dream team that year was Adlai Stevenson-and Alabama segregationist John Sparkman.

(Eisenhower started a trend, but as far back as the 1920s Republicans were sporadically winning southern states. In 1920, Warren Harding won Tennessee and in 1928 Herbert Hoover won Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Florida and Texas. Between Hoover and Eisenhower, Republicans didn't win a single presidential election, much less the South. The Hoover/Eisenhower southern states were the same states Nixon and Reagan would do best in-not the states Barry Goldwater carried in 1964. More on that to come.)

Eisenhower put a slew of blacks into prominent positions in his administration- unlike Barack Obama he chose competent ones-and quickly moved to desegregate the military, something President Harry Truman had announced, but failed to fully implement.

It took a lifelong soldier who had smashed the Nazi war machine to compel total racial integration in the military. Eisenhower may have felt as his fellow Republican and soldier Senator Charles Potter did when he stood on crutches in the well of the Senate-he lost both legs in World War II - and denounced the Democrats for refusing to pass a civil rights bill. ""I fought beside Negroes in the war,"" Potter said. ""I saw them die for us. For the Senate of the United States to repay these valiant men . . . by a watereddown version of this legislation would make a mockery of the democratic concept we hold so dear.""

When Eisenhower ran for reelection in 1956, the Republican Party platform endorsed the recent Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education desegregating public schools. The Democratic platform did not. Indeed, a number of Democratic governors proceeded to ignore the landmark decision. Ike responded by sending in the 101st Airborne to walk black children to school.

In his second term, Eisenhower pushed through two major civil rights laws and created the Civil Rights Commission-over the stubborn objections of Democrats. Senator Lyndon Johnson warned his fellow segregationist Democrats, ""Be ready to take up the goddamned nigra bill again."" Liberal hero, Senator Sam Ervin told his fellow segregationists, ""I'm on your side, not theirs,"" adding ruefully, ""we've got to give the goddamned niggers something.""

Vice President Richard Nixon pulled some procedural tricks as president of the Senate to get the 1957 bill passed, for which he was personally thanked by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But LBJ had stripped the first bill of enforcement provisions, so Eisenhower introduced another, stronger civil rights bill in 1960. All eighteen votes against both bills were by Democrats. Democratic opposition to civil rights was becoming what we call ""a pattern.""

Unfortunately for the cause of equality, Nixon lost the 1960 presidential election and there wasn't much enthusiasm for aggressively enforcing civil rights laws in either the Kennedy or Johnson administrations. That would have to wait for Nixon's return.

But with the electoral tide turning-thanks in large part to E isenhower's civil rights laws and Thurgood Marshall's lawsuits-LBJ did a complete turnaround as president and suddenly decided to push through a dramatic civil rights bill. Black people were voting in large enough numbers that Democrats were either going to have to abandon the segregationists or never win another national election, so Johnson switched sides out of a sincere commitment to civil rights. (Northern blacks had begun moving to the Democratic Party with President Franklin Roosevelt's usual enticement of government largesse.)

Even with a Democratic president behind the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a far larger percentage of Republicans than Democrats voted for it. Eminent Democratic luminaries voted against it, including Senators Ernest Hollings, Richard Russell, Sam Ervin, Albert Gore Sr., J. William Fulbright (Bill Clinton's mentor) and of course, Robert Byrd. Overall, 82 percent of Senate Republicans supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964, compared to only 66 percent of Democrats. In the House, 80 percent of Republicans voted for it, while only 63 percent of Democrats did.

Crediting Democrats for finally coming on board with Republican civil rights policies by supporting the 1964 act would be nearly as absurd as giving the Democrats all the glory for Reagan's 1981 tax cuts-which passed with the support of 99 percent of Republicans but only 29 percent of Democrats.

Nixon launched his national comeback with a 1966 column bashing Democrats as ""the party of Maddox, Mahoney and Wallace"" trying ""to squeeze the last ounces of political juice out of the rotting fruit of racial injustice."" One can see why Democrats would later be desperate to impeach him, especially Sam Ervin, a major segregationist who headed the Senate Watergate panel.

One of the main reasons Nixon chose a rookie like Spiro Agnew as his vice presidential nominee was Agnew's sterling civil rights record. Agnew had passed some of the first bans on racial discrimination in public housing in the nation-before the federal laws-and then beaten segregationist George Mahoney for governor of Maryland in 1966. That was the Mahoney in ""Maddox, Mahoney and Wallace.""

With the segregationist vote split between Democrat Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace in the 1968 presidential election, Nixon won. In his inaugural address, he said, ""No man can be fully free while his neighbor is not. To go forward at all is to go forward together. This means black and white together, as one nation, not two. The laws have caught up with our conscience. What remains is to give life to what is in the law: to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before God, all are born equal in dignity before man.""

President Nixon proceeded to desegregate the public schools with lightning speed. Just within Nixon's first two years, black students attending segregated schools in the South declined from nearly 70 percent to 18.4 percent. There was more desegregation of American schools in Nixon's first term than in any historical period before or since.

During the campaign, Nixon had said, ""people in the ghetto have to have more than an equal chance. They should be given a dividend."" As president, he followed through by imposing formal racial quotas and timelines on the building trades. The construction industry got a lot of business from the federal government and yet had doggedly refused to hire blacks. They had been given long enough do so voluntarily. Nixon was fed up with the union's foot dragging and demanded results.

LBJ has been heaped with praise merely for having proposed an affirmative action plan for the building trades. But he backed down from pursuing the plan as soon as the first objection was raised. As with Truman's unenforced executive order desegregating the military, it took a Republican president to actually get it done.

The century-long struggle for civil rights was over. Attorney Thurgood Marshall had won his cases before the Supreme Court. President Eisenhower made clear he was willing to deploy the U.S. military to enforce those victories. President Nixon had desegregated the schools and building trades. Racist lunatic-and Democrat-Eugene ""Bull"" Connor was voted out of office by the good people of Birmingham, Alabama. The world had changed so much that even a majority of Democrats were at last supporting civil rights. After nearly a century of Republicans fighting for civil rights against Democratic segregationists, it was over.

That was the precise moment when liberals decided it was time to come out strongly against race discrimination.

For the next two decades liberals engaged in a ritualistic reenactment of the struggle for civil rights-long after it had any relevance to what was happening in the world. Their obsession with race was weirdly disconnected from actual causes and plausible remedies. They simply insisted on staging virtual Halloween dress-up parties, in which some people were designated ""racists,"" others ""victims of racist violence"" and themselves, ""saviors of black America.""

The fact that New York City was the crucible of so much racial agitation in the seventies and eighties shows how phony it was. There was never any public segregation in New York. No one was moved to the back of the bus. There were no ""whites only"" water fountains. There were no segregated lunch counters. (Blacks could even get a sixteen-ounce soda in New York City back then!) But liberals love to drape themselves in decades-old glories they had nothing to do with.

Defending himself on Hannity & Colmes in 2004 after sneering about the competence of Condoleezza Rice, the first black female secretary of state in U.S. history, Democratic operative and fatuous blowhard Bob Beckel boasted: ""I spent a lot of time out in the vineyards on the civil rights movement."" Proving it, he said, ""I've got scars on the back of my neck.""

Beckel was between twelve and fifteen years old during the big civil rights struggles-such as the 1961 Freedom Rides and the murders of three CORE workers by the Ku Klux Klan in 1964. He was still in high school when Martin Luther King was transitioning from civil rights to the ""poor people's campaign"" and white liberals were moving on to antiwar protests. Next, Beckel will be claiming to have been a member of 1927 Yankees.

Once-respected Mount Holyoke history professor Joseph Ellis also bragged about his work in the civil rights movement. He told one reporter that he had been followed and harassed by racist southern cops while on the Freedom Trail in Mississippi. In June 2001, the Boston Globe looked into the facts and discovered that this, along with many of Ellis's other fantasies, was a complete fabrication. He had never been a civil rights worker.

For Carl Bernstein, the Washington Post reporter whose famous Watergate reportage with Bob Woodward became a book and movie, All the President's Men, the moment of civil rights heroism came when he was on a B'nai B'rith youth trip through the South when the train broke down in Greensboro, North Carolina. Carl alleges that he led the other teenagers in a sit-in at the train station cafeteria, refusing to leave the black restaurant and nearly getting arrested. For this act of brave defiance, Bernstein claims in his book, Loyalties, he was later reprimanded by B'nai B'rith leaders.

Reporter and author Adrian Havill searched for any evidence of the alleged sit-in for his book, Deep Truth: The Lives of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. He interviewed dozens of people who ought to have known about it-other students on the trip, locals involved in trying to desegregate the station, B'nai B'rith leaders. Not one recalled such an incident. One friend on the trip said, ""It is apocryphal at best."" No Greensboro newspapers mentioned it, and several Jewish leaders denied it ever happened.

As long as they are in no real danger, liberals love to hallucinate racist violence, with themselves playing the heroes defending poor blacks in imaginary physical confrontations-or at least blistering editorials. Every liberal over a certain age claims to have marched in Selma and accompanied the Freedom Riders.

A favorite liberal taunt is to accuse conservatives of clinging to an idealized past. Poor, right-wing Americans vaguely sense the world is changing and now they're lashing out. What about the idealized past liberals cling to? They all act as if they were civil rights foot soldiers constantly getting beat up by 500-pound southern sheriffs, while every twenty-year old Republican today is treated as if he is on Team Bull Connor. At best, the struggle for civil rights was an intra-Democratic Party fight. More accurately, it was Republicans and blacks fighting Democrat segregationists and enablers.

While liberals spent the decades after the civil rights era pretending they were fighting 1962 battles-when most of them were five years old-the rest of us had to live through race riots, denunciations of the police, extreme restrictions on speech, liberal racial pandering and a stream of racial Armageddons.

For decades, one racist incident after another filled the news pages: a racist police siege of Louis Farrakhan's mosque; trigger-happy cops shooting peaceful blacks, like Jose (Kiko) Garcia and Edmund Perry; Nazis on the Wappinger Falls police force; black children held down while having their faces forcibly painted white; the racist prosecution of Washington, DC mayor Marion Barry; police brutality against an innocent black motorist in Los Angeles; and on and on. Loads of these hate crimes turned out to be hoaxes, but they would be followed by retaliatory crimes against whites, which were not.

From race riots to race hoaxes to the automatic excuse machine for black criminals, the country had gone mad.

Contrary to what you might imagine, all this did little to improve the situation of blacks. In fact, it was exactly the opposite of what was needed.

After slavery, most of black America was starting at the bottom rung of social advancement. Not only that, but they had spent centuries in the backwoods culture of Southern hillbillies. Thomas Sowell points out that much of what is thought to be black culture is actually Southern ""cracker"" culture, imported, like Russell Brand, from the Northern provinces of the British Isles.

In his book, Black Rednecks and White Liberals, Sowell traces behavioral patterns of various early Americans back to their original regions in the British Isles. Most colonialists in Massachusetts, for example, came from a small area in East Anglia. They were educated, religious and genteel.

White Southerners were another story. Much of the Southern population was made up of eighteenth-century immigrants from the ""Celtic fringe""-Scotland, Ireland and Wales. As Sowell demonstrates with a mountain of hilarious examples, the unique cultural attributes of these British highlanders included wanton and brutal violence, hair-trigger tempers, an obsession with pride, shocking promiscuity, unalterable sloth, illiteracy and a total lack of respect for human life, including their own.

Today the only place we see this culture is on the TV show Cops-and in the black underclass.

The people of the Celtic fringe were practically a different species from those who settled New England. In the seventeenth century, rape was a capital offense in New England, while in some parts of the South it was treated as a misdemeanor on the order of petty theft. Around the time of the Civil War, illiteracy was virtually nonexistent in New England, but more than 20 percent of Southern whites still couldn't read. In military IQ tests administered during World War I, black recruits from northern states like Ohio, Illinois, New York and Pennsylvania scored higher than white southerners from Georgia, Arkansas, Kentucky and Mississippi.

The very word ""cracker"" is thought by some scholars to refer to the prideful boasting of the transplanted British highlanders. Remnants of their fighting spirit has proved a boon to the U.S. military, but a few centuries ago, their skirmishing included fights that involved biting off noses, gouging out eyes, and ripping the ears off their opponents' heads. Far from objecting, local crowds would enthusiastically cheer the combatants on. A millennium ago, even Roman armies couldn't subdue the barbarians of Scotland and instead built a gigantic wall, penning them in the north.

David Hackett Fischer gives an example of the ""exceptionally violent"" backcountry ways from 1787 newspaper accounts in his book, Albion's Seed: ""robbers seized a man named Davis and tortured him at his own hearth with red-hot irons until he told them where his money was hidden. Then they burned his farm for their amusement and 'left the poor man tied to behold all in flames.'"" The raiding parties ""mutilated their victims for sport."" These were families-and women were often the most violent.

A British soldier, Major George Hanger, said of the backcountry Scots- Irish, ""I have known one of these fellows [to] travel two hundred miles through the woods never keeping any road or path, guided by the sun by day, and the stars by night, to kill a particular person.""

It was these colorful folkways of the Celtic fringe that southern blacks were marinated in for centuries, but today are written about by twentyfirst- century sociologists as a specifically ""black culture.""

These traits have nothing to do with Africa or the legacy of slavery. The quaint customs of southern rednecks came directly from their Scottish, Welsh and Irish ancestors and were passed on to southern blacks.

The East Coast-West Coast hip-hop rivalry, with its ""diss tracks"" and shootings and murders, are not a distant echo from the plains of Africa, but a modern version of the Hatfields and the McCoys, with much greater use of the F-word. For decades, raging right up to the twentieth century, these two Scottish families warred across the Kentucky and West Virginia border, leaving at least a dozen dead.

The Southern style of religious worship also lives on in black churches, as well as some white Protestant evangelical churches. It can be seen in the style, if not the substance, of Louis Farrakhan and the Reverend Jeremiah Wright. Citing Frederick Law Olmstead's direct observation of Southern religious services in the late nineteenth century, Sowell describes the technique thus: The preacher ""nearly all the time cried aloud at the utmost stretch of his voice,"" ""had the habit of frequently repeating a phrase,"" and exhibited ""a dramatic talent that included leaning far over the desk, with his arms stretched forward, gesticulating violently, yelling at the highest key, and catching his breath with an effort.""

Voting Democrat is another bad habit blacks picked up from their neighbors. Southern blacks voted against their fellow Southerners only immediately after the Civil War and during the Democrats' Jim Crow period. But then things settled down and blacks began supporting the same southern Democratic demagogues as white southerners did. The smarmy disingenuousness of a Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, or John Edwards seems familiar and homey to southern whites and blacks alike.

It is a telling fact that although most blacks detested Ronald Reagan-a 90 percent black jury even found his attempted assassin, John Hinckley, not guilty19-a majority of black Alabamians came to support segregationist rabble-rouser Democrat George Wallace in his later years.

Wallace had stood in the schoolhouse door rather than allow the University of Alabama to be integrated; he appealed to white supremacists for political advantage; and he ran for president expressly as a segregationist. As late as 1970, Wallace had used a campaign flyer in his run for governor that proclaimed: ""Wake Up, Alabama! Blacks vow to take over Alabama,"" accompanied by a picture of a blonde white girl on a park bench surrounded by seven leering black men.

But just about a decade later, Wallace went to black voters and apologized, admitting he was a Christian sinner-and they forgave him. Wallace won 90 percent of the black vote in his last run for governor in 1982.

Wallace spoke the language of the South; Reagan didn't.

Reagan was a straightforward Californian without an ounce of southern populism. He wasn't a demonstrative speaker, he didn't openly discuss his Christianity and there was nary an opportunity for audience participation during his speeches.

Even what is risibly called Ebonics-black dialect-can be traced back to the British highlanders, who used such words and phrases as ""I be,"" ""You be,"" ""ax"" (ask), ""acrost"" (across), ""do"" (door), ""dat"" (that). As Sowell says, ""No such words came from Africa.""

Luckily for southern rednecks, their wild and wooly ways weren't tolerated in the North. They were barely tolerated in the South, where these poor whites were used as a buffer against the Indians, but not much more could be done about them, inasmuch as the rednecks far outnumbered the gentry.

Long before there was discrimination against blacks, there was discrimination against white southerners. When large numbers of these country people moved north during World War II , they were aggressively excluded from neighborhoods, jobs and homes-not because of their skin color, but their accents.

It was grossly unfair: Not all southerners were slothful, promiscuous drunks. But northerners couldn't be expected to examine each case individually to ascertain whether an applicant was Robert Penn Warren or Bull Connor, Flannery O'Connor or Casey Anthony. It was more efficient simply to discriminate against all southerners.

The identical thing happened with Irish immigrants in the nineteenth century. They brought many of the same primitive behaviors directly from the British Isles-but when their native folkways turned violent, they were met with Anglo-Saxon law and order.

The North's zero-tolerance policy for a backward culture forced the white trash out of both the Irish and southern rednecks, leaving just enough of them in their natural state to populate modern reality shows and the Kennedy family.

Unfortunately, such harsh but effective policies were briefly practiced and then guiltily abandoned when it came to southern blacks. In fact, New York City mayor John Lindsay expressly argued against bringing black people into the middle class through the immigrant model of assimilation in the Kerner Report, examining the reasons for the 1967 race riots.

Although some blacks made it north in time to be acculturated to New England mores, just as the mass of black Americans were on the verge of shedding their adopted redneck culture in the sixties and seventies, the nation's elites decided to adopt a new set of rules. A 1958 Time magazine article reported: ""They are afraid to say so in public, but many of the North's big-city mayors groan in private that their biggest and most worrisome problem is the crime rate among Negroes.""

Instead of punishing violence, criminality, sexual promiscuity and other charming Celtic customs-as society had with white southerners- we would protect the exact same behavior among black southerners as priceless cultural artifacts of their African heritage. That's how we ended up with the intractable black underclass.

First, liberals set to work destroying the black family. The broken family isn't a black thing. As Sowell points out, there are numerous accounts of newly freed slaves who had been separated from their wives walking across entire states, looking for their families. Economic circumstances aside, the black family unit in the immediate postslavery era was a dream compared to what Democrats have done to it today. The same was true before slavery, with African wives clinging to their husbands as they were being taken into slavery by African raiders and having to be whipped until they would let go.

Erol Ricketts, a demographer and sociologist with the Rockefeller Foundation, found that between 1890 and 1950, blacks had higher marriage rates than whites, according to the U.S. Census. Until then, black women were more likely to get married than white women-and that was despite the high mortality rates among black men, which left fewer of them available for marriage and made more black women widows. In three of four decennial years between 1890 and 1920, black men outmarried white men, with a virtual tie in 1900 at about 54 percent.

Black Americans were moving forward on a well-trod path in this country when liberals decided it would be a great idea to start subsidizing illegitimacy.

Everyone knew-even FDR's secretary of labor, Frances Perkins, knew-that granting widows' benefits to unmarried women with illegitimate children would have disastrous consequences. An early twentiethcentury social welfare advocate, Homer Folks, warned back in 1914 that to grant pensions for ""desertion or illegitimacy would, undoubtedly, have the effect of a premium upon these crimes against society.""

But under LBJ, that's exactly the system liberals implemented. The ""suitable home"" requirements for welfare-such as having a husband- were jettisoned as irrational and racist by liberal know-it-alls in the federal Bureau of Public Assistance. By 1960, only 8 percent of welfare benefits intended for widows or wives with disabled husbands were being collected by such. More than 60 percent of Aid to Families with Dependent Children payments went to ""absent father"" homes. As a result, illegitimacy, particularly among blacks, went through the roof.

That was the very year the black marriage rate began its precipitous decline, gradually at first, with the marriage rate for black women falling below 70 percent for the first time only in 1970. As late as that, a majority of black children were still living with both parents. As Ricketts says, ""The argument that current levels of female-headed families among blacks are due directly to the cultural legacy of slavery and that black family-formation patterns are fundamentally different from those of whites are not supported by the data.""

Rather, it resulted from the specific policy of paying women to have children out of wedlock-in Folks's words, putting a ""premium upon these crimes against society.""

By 2010, only 30.1 percent of blacks above the age of fifteen were married, compared to 52.7 percent of whites. If blacks managed to get married again at their pre-Great Society rates, the entire black ""culture of poverty"" would be wiped out. Black people know this: The vital importance of the institution of marriage, felt by its absence, is reflected in the overwhelming, ferocious opposition to gay marriage in the black community.

Next, liberal judges and academics decided it was a bad idea to punish criminals. Instead, they suggested we try to understand the criminal, persuade him that the system is fair and give him 157 second chances.

This was not simply a failure to implement good policies. It was an aggressive plan to impose idiotic ideas dreamed up by self-righteous people who had worked it all out on paper. In a classic decision of the era, a New York judge refused to institutionalize Joyce Brown- nom du insensé Billie Boggs-a psychotic and schizophrenic woman living on the street, who was menacing passersby, defecating on herself, smoking crack, burning money and running into traffic.

Brown's family begged that she be put in an institution, but the American Civil Liberties Union disagreed. Norman Siegel, director of the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), said Brown was merely ""eccentric and different"" and had ""no business being taken to Bellevue."" In an argument few could disagree with, her attorney, Robert Levy, said Brown was as sane as ""a member of the board of the Civil Liberties Union.""

Judge Robert Lippman agreed with the ACLU. He explained that ""the sight of her may improve us. By being an offense to the aesthetic senses, she may spur the community to action.""

Of course, the community had already been spurred to action, which was precisely why it was seeking to have her committed to a mental institution.

Ordinary people said: You think not imprisoning criminals will lead to less crime? You say that by paying women to have children out of wedlock, we'll reduce the illegitimacy rate? Are you sure that a guaranteed income will encourage people to work harder? They were ridiculed as unenlightened rubes.

Between 1960 and 1973, the number of FBI index crimes-which are serious offenses such as murder, rape, robbery, arson, assault, kidnapping and burglary-nearly tripled from 2,019,600 offenses a year to 5,891,924.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans had to die, be raped or have their property destroyed or stolen because liberals had some neat new ideas about crime. As with all of the left's social experiments, it was the people at the bottom of society who bore the brunt of jaw-dropping crime rates.

It's striking that the race riots of the sixties were nearly nonexistent in the South, the locus of earlier Democratic segregationist and Klan violence. Rather, the hotbeds of violence were all the places where liberal ideas about crime and punishment prevailed-New York, Philadelphia, Rochester (NJ), Paterson and Newark, Detroit and Los Angeles.

All the while, the entire press corps dedicated itself to clamping down on anyone who looked askance at the dysfunctional black culture that liberals had done so much to cultivate. All Americans walked on eggshells for fear of being called a racist and having their reputations ruined. The elites' ceaseless defense of behavior that would never have been tolerated from a white person destroyed lives and got people killed- most of them black.

If liberal elites had spent years designing a plan to harm blacks, they couldn't have come up with a more ingenious one. Subsidize something, and you will get more of it. Tax it and you will get less of it. Both literally and figuratively, liberals taxed good behavior and subsidized bad behavior right about the time a lot of blacks needed to go through the same hardknocks education that white southerners and Irish had.

Illegitimacy was directly subsidized through Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The ""tax"" on crime was largely eliminated as liberal reformers shackled the police and rewarded criminals with reduced or nonexistent prison sentences. Honest discussion about the effects of these policies, such as exploding black crime rates, racial discrimination against white college applicants, and the black illegitimacy crisis was ""taxed"" by the penalty of being called a racist and possibly losing one's job.

Meanwhile, the black crime, dropout and illegitimacy rates continued their ever-upward spiral. Black college students were expected to major in ""Being Black,"" instead of subjects that might get them jobs outside of a university or a government agency.

To hide their own role in the suppression of a black middle class, liberals promoted the myth that slavery alone had produced dystopian black lives. This is the quasi-theological underpinning of the modern welfare state. But the culprit wasn't slavery: It was the seventies. Anyone who looks closely at the footage of Martin Luther King's campaign will see impeccably attired audiences in sober business clothes. These were enormous middle-class gatherings, with married parents and intact families. That ethic, that population-black lawyers, doctors, shop owners-was destroyed by malignant reformers who then papered over their dirty work with the creation of a fraudulent black middle class engineered through affirmative action and government jobs.

Slavery-a policy defended to the death by Democrats-already meant that the great mass of black Americans were starting on the ground floor. But even that other Democratic innovation, the Jim Crow laws, couldn't stop blacks from progressing in the century following emancipation. It was modern Democratic policies guaranteeing that much of black America would fall back down.

From slavery to Jim Crow to ""hope and change,"" liberals wrote the book on how to destroy a people. Democrats simply would not treat blacks as the equal of whites, deserving of rebuke for bad behavior just like a white person. Anyone opposed to mollycoddling blacks would be denounced as a racist.

It could be called ""racism by mollycoddling,"" except that liberals don't actually want to hurt black people. They couldn't care less about black people.

All they care about is their own glorious selves and how courageous, forward-thinking and fair-minded they are. At least the old Democratic racists were unabashed demagogues. Modern racists wrap themselves in unbounded self-righteousness.

This isn't a story about black people-it's a story about the left's agenda to patronize blacks and lie to everyone else. It wasn't black people's job to stop whites from acting like idiots. It took blubberbutts like Jim Dwyer, Anna Quindlen, Tom Wicker, Howell Raines and the Los Angeles Times to treat blacks as always right, never wrong, while self-righteously disparaging execrable, boring, rhythmless white people. Excluding their own hip selves, of course.

There was a whole industry of people that depended on the existence of racism, but Americans had not been delivering on being racists for years. By 1970, there were more child pornographers in the country than racists. So the media set about inventing them.

But no one could acknowledge that fact until the O. J. Simpson verdict.

Here we had a black celebrity, spectacularly guilty of murder but acquitted by a predominantly black jury. The verdict was wildly cheered by blacks across the nation. With those images, we were finally liberated from having to pretend America was run by the Klan. It was a watershed moment. It was the end of white guilt.

The media, politicians and academia had turned blacks into spoiled children who had never before heard the word no. After this one breathtaking miscarriage of justice, the American people said no and the White Guilt Bank was shut down overnight.

With that, America became a much healthier country. Blacks could never be brought into the culture while being so thoroughly infantilized by white liberals who oohed and aahed over every little thing they did.

The only people who had ever benefited from the left's lunacy on race were (1) professional blacks and (2) self-righteous white liberals, who congratulated themselves on their own ethnic sensitivity while moving heaven and earth to make sure their own kids didn't go to school with black kids.

In 1993, a few years before the Simpson verdict, New York Times columnist Brent Staples complained that ""black prep school boys who study the classics and live within the law have found only marginal acceptance in American cultural reality."" American culture, he said, preferred to celebrate the ""angry black men.""

After the OJ trial, ""angry black men"" were a lot less attractive. Talented black people were in.

Blacks were the only people, as we discovered with the OJ verdict, who cheered criminals just because they were the same race. It's one thing to complain if an innocent member of your race is falsely accused. But when the guy turns out to be guilty, it's hard to imagine any other group instantly siding with the perp because of some shared characteristic. You didn't have white people rooting for Charles Manson, gays hoping Jeffrey Dahmer would be acquitted or Hispanics supporting Richard Ramirez, the Night Stalker. (Liberals rooted for Teddy Kennedy, but that's another book.)

After the OJ verdict, blacks' ferocious group identity began to weaken.

By 2007, an NPR/Pew poll showed that 53 percent of blacks said that those who couldn't get ahead were mostly responsible for their own condition, compared to 30 percent who said it was because of discrimination- a reversal of percentages from just a decade earlier. (And if NPR came up with 53 percent, just imagine how much higher the actual figure must be!)

Even black people would admit, Yeah it was a scam, but it was fun while it lasted. You can push people too far and the OJ verdict pushed racial browbeating too far, just as raising taxes too high eventually leads people to stop paying them.

Much of the change came in subtle social signals. The daily hair-on-fire racism stories, for example, virtually disappeared. No longer would pompous whites consider it a showstopper to announce at dinner parties that America is still a racist country. Appeals to white self-condemnation no longer worked. White people on TV stopped pretending that it was a hate crime every time a black person got shot. Jesse Jackson was totally sidelined. Even Al Sharpton's racial agitating no longer got front-page coverage. In fact, Sharpton's reputation dropped so precipitously that he was forced to trade in his tracksuit for some dress clothes.

The OJ verdict lost everyone except the diehards in the media and the universities-always the last to know. They'd still trot out their groundbreaking America-is-a-racist-country insights now and then, but Americans weren't buying it.

Despite mounds of incriminating evidence, the jury acquitted O. J. Simpson of a brutal double murder after only three hours of deliberation. It came back to that implacable fact.

Completely inadvertently, that verdict ended up being one of the best things that had ever happened to black America. Only with the waning influence of race hustlers and their white liberal enablers did the world discover that there were loads of competent blacks out there! Where had they been all this time?

Liberals muddled through the next twelve years, disconsolate because their claims of racism were falling flat. Can't you let us have any of our cherished illusions? Can't you let us keep being self-professed saviors to the blacks? For liberals, the OJ verdict was like telling them there was no Santa Claus.

Enter half-white, half-Kenyan Barack Obama. He was a dream come true for liberal elites: They could indulge in self-righteousness on race and get a hardcore leftie into the White House at the same time! It was too great a temptation to resist. So now we're back to liberals finding racists under every bed again.

The ""postracial"" president has brought racial unrest back with a whoop. Obama toys with it, but mostly he allows others to make despicable racial smears on his behalf. As the New York Times described Obama's typical campaign strategy back in 2008: ""This has been [campaign manager David] Axelrod's career, an eternal return to Chicago and to the politics of race.""

It's always the person with the least black heritage who is angriest at the antiracism meetings. The ones who have never actually experienced anything resembling Jim Crow-in fact nothing but white suck-uppery- the most consumed with rage about things having nothing to do with their life experiences.

Responding to tapes of his insane racist preacher, Jeremiah Wright, Obama said that we need ""to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist in the African American community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow.""

Yes, let's bask in blacks' exquisite grievances against whites a little longer- just in case anyone missed Roots, Do the Right Thing, Amistad, The Color Purple, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?, Mississippi Burning, The Hurricane, Malcolm X, Monster's Ball, A Raisin in the Sun, To Kill a Mockingbird, Tuskegee Airmen, Ghosts of Mississippi, Ali, The Green Mile and every ABC after-school special ever produced (except the ones about eating disorders) as well as your entire college education and the last fifty years of the New York Times and all other mainstream media outlets issuing hysterical updates on the unending civil rights struggle. In the last two decades, the Times has run more than 250 articles about the Selma march alone. Selma happened nearly half a century ago.

Our nation's routine condescension to black racists like Reverend Wright is insulting and creates utter disaster for blacks. Wright's rhetoric encourages easy moral excuses for murder, mayhem and a total disregard for the norms of civilized society. White criminals are at least treated with enough respect to be held morally responsible for their crimes. With black criminals, liberals believe it's always the lash of racism that made them do it, and racist cops, prosecutors, witnesses and jurors who convicted them.

We have recited the civic mantra for half a century: An institution that was wiped out 150 years ago is responsible for all bad behavior of blacks. This little mental exercise has led to a world in which blacks murder, assault, rape and sell drugs at rates that stagger the imagination, yet cannot understand why the avenues of prosperity remain closed to them.

Apparently endless jawboning about black grievances is not the soothing emolument liberals imagined it would be. Can't we return to the halcyon days between the OJ verdict and the Obama campaign, when whites weren't presumed to be harboring racist fantasies and blacks weren't presumed to be children?

No, we can't. Obama is up for reelection.

Obama has repeatedly returned to the well of racial divisiveness to serve his political ends. His 2008 presidential campaign managed to revive the white guilt that had long since dissipated, and then hinted that the one path to racial reconciliation was to make him president. Only then could we stop talking about race-a conversation he had initiated in the first place.

Alas, since he's been president, that's all we talk about.

The Obama presidency has been like the David Dinkins mayoralty all over again, with utter incompetence being papered over with appeals to white guilt.

At least Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor gave us a time limit on how much longer government discrimination against white people would be legal to make up for the historical injustices: twenty-five years.

With the Democrats it never ends.

It doesn't matter that the race-baiters were proved to be lying hucksters every five minutes throughout the seventies, eighties and nineties, up until the OJ verdict. Whenever the America-is-still-racist story fell apart, the media never told us the conclusions to the story, so they feel their false alarms shouldn't count.

The non-Fox media leapt on the Trayvon Martin shooting like Ted Kennedy on a case of scotch. Following procedure, as soon as their version of events began to collapse, liberals put the story in a lead casket and dropped it to the bottom of the ocean. The nation eagerly awaits their next example of America-is-a-racist-country, which will again turn out to be a hoax. But maybe there's still time to make up a good one before November 6.

Nothing can be left to cruel chance! Liberals are gearing up for the racial mau-mauing of a lifetime. To save Obama, liberals have gone right back to their old tricks. Let's review them.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/amish-bishop-found-guilty-beard-shaving-attacks/story?id=17283193,"The leader of an Amish splinter sect and his followers were found guilty today of violating federal hate crime laws for conducting a series of bizarre attacks in which they shaved the hair and beards of other Amish whose religious beliefs they disagreed with.

A jury found Samuel Mullet Sr. and 15 members of his church guilty of the attacks that rocked the picturesque Amish communities of eastern Ohio.

Prosecutors said the attacks were hate crimes because the victims were targeted for their religious beliefs and because the attacks were focused on the victim's hair and beards, which the Amish believe they are spiritually obligated to keep long.

Mullet, 66, was not personally accused of shaving anyone, but prosecutors said he was considered the group's leader and bishop, and instructed his followers, including four of his children, to conduct the attacks.

Mullet and the other members never denied the cuttings, but said they were not hate crimes. Mullet insisted they were a response to other Amish leaders criticizing him for being too strict.

Members of Mullet's settlement testified that the bishop had ordered men to serve out punishments in chicken coops, and women were subjected to sexual ""counseling.""

Mullet's followers committed five attacks, including one on a neighboring bishop, cutting his chest length beard back to his chin.

Each of the convicted sect members faces up to 10 years in prison.

Is Cory Booker inching closer to challenging New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for the governor's seat in 2013?

Addressing the LGBT caucus meeting in Charlotte, N.C., Thursday afternoon, Booker, the mayor of Newark, N.J., hinted at a potential run for governor, telling the gathering he hopes to ""have a very good seat"" when marriage equality is achieved in the Garden State.

""I'm telling you right now, it's not a matter of if we're going to win marriage equality in New Jersey, it's a matter of when we're going to win it,"" Booker said. ""And I know in my heart of hearts, if God is willing, I will be there on that day that bill is signed. I might even have a very good seat when it gets done.""

Amid applause and chants of ""Cory, Cory, Cory,"" one man shouted, ""Booker for governor.""

Watch our ABC News/Yahoo News Convention Show LIVE tonight, 7-11:30 PM HERE.

In late August, PolitickerNJ reported, party sources said Booker and his political adviser were meeting with county chairs to express his interest in running for governor, a decision he reportedly will make by December.

Booker praised the determination of the LGBT community to attain equal rights and compared its struggles to those faced by the African American community.

""I'm at home,"" Booker said. ""When it comes to movements for justice in the United States of America, this room is full of heroes - each and every one of you.""

""The black community was denied justice for a long time,"" he said. ""We were denied equal citizenship rights for a long time. And it was Americans - black and white, Christian and Jew, gay and straight - that went down and marched with Martin Luther King, who went down, who went down and fought for my voting rights, fought for my marriage rights, fought for my civil rights.

""I'm so happy that my president, the first African American president in the history of the United States, has stood up and helped lead the way so that every community understands that we all were there once,"" Booker said. ""Hatred is hatred. Bigotry is bigotry, and we need to wake up America to understand that inequality is inequality. Every person who says, 'I am a citizen of the United States of America,' should have equal citizenship rights.""

Dr. Jill Biden addressed the meeting ahead of Booker's speech and touted her husband and President Obama's commitment to LGBT issues, acknowledging the advancements made in the LGBT community under the president's watch.

""So much is at stake in this election. You know that, and especially for the LGBT community, we've got to make sure that we keep moving forward on gay rights so that we can continue the progress we made,"" Biden said, ""progress like ending 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' signing the Matthew Shepard hate crimes laws, refusing to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court and expanding visitation rights for same-sex partners in hospitals. And of course, we have the first president and vice president in history to affirm support for gay marriage.""

A Michigan college student who claimed he was attacked and his mouth stapled because he was Jewish has been contradicted by police who say the fight might have been about a girl.

Michigan State University student Zachary Tennen was attacked by two other students at an off-campus party on Saturday, according to police. Tennen, 19, told ABC News affiliate WXYZ that he was taunted about being Jewish before the men became physical with him.

""They mentioned that they're Nazis and they're in the KKK,"" Tennen said. ""They came up behind me and punched me across the jaw. They knocked me unconscious and I found a staple in me after.""

Tennen took a taxi to a hospital, where doctors found a staple in his mouth before wiring his broken jaw shut.

Police in East Lansing, Mich., however, said Tuesday that they did not believe the attack was a hate crime, and privately told the Tennens that they believed the fight was over a girl.

Police said in a statement released to ABC News that they had interviewed two witnesses and identified a suspect, though the incident was still under investigation.

Tennen's father, Bruce Tennen, told WXYZ that he disagrees with the police, and that his son talked to very few girls at the party and had never had a long-term girlfriend.

""I think this is a heinous crime and it sickens me,"" Bruce Tennen said, adding that if police arrest and charge someone just with assault, he will hire his own lawyer and try to pursue an ethnic intimidation or hate crime in federal court.",abcnews.com,True

A 19-year-old college student who was attending a party near Michigan State University early Sunday morning said he was beaten and his lips were stapled together after his attackers asked if he was Jewish, according to police.

Zachary Tennen told police that while he was at a party in East Lansing, Mich., two men punched him after he told them he was Jewish when they asked.

Tennen's mother told the Indianapolis Star newspaper that the two men raised their arms ""in a Nazi salute, chanting 'Heil Hitler,'"" before attacking Tennen. They then allegedly stapled his lips together, forcing a staple into his gums, according to the report.

Tennen told police that the men also said they were part of the Klu Klux Klan, according to Michigan State University's school newspaper, The State.

According to that report, Tennen awoke from being knocked out and took a cab to a local hospital. He notified East Lansing police of the incident later Sunday morning.

U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster began the morning interviewing 81 people in the jury pool, asking them their views on whether the government has the right to file charges based on religion, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported.

The defendants have maintained the alleged attacks were a matter of internal discipline and not connected to any religious bias. All 16 defendants have pleaded not guilty, many rejecting plea deals that would have sent them to prison for two to three years.

The government revealed Friday that horse mane shears, along with hair samples, recorded jailhouse phone calls, and a camera they say was used to photograph the victims have been entered in the Cleveland court as evidence in the case.

But at least one of the criminal complaints filed against bishop Samuel Mullet Sr. and members of his family claimed that the group was waging a violent campaign targeted at community members on the other side of a church feud.

They now face potentially lengthy federal prison sentences if they are convicted of conspiracy to violate the Matthew Shepard-James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

The Amish believe the Bible instructs men to wear beards and stop shaving once they marry and for women grow their hair long.

""Victims will testify that the loss of their beards caused them great distress and embarrassment and altered their life activities to the point that they did not want to appear in public,"" prosecutors said, seeking to back their hate crimes charge.

Court documents trace the root of the conflict back to 2005, when members reportedly began leaving Mullet's sect because of his controlling behavior.

His former daughter- and son-in-law told investigators that Mullet exercised complete authority over the group, causing physical injury to those who would defy him. This included, they said, forcing members to sleep for days at a time in a chicken coop on his property and suffer public beatings.

He also allegedly ""counseled"" married women by having sex with them in his home.

Prosecutors say Mullet, accompanied by his sons, sons-in-law, and nephews, hired a driver -- the Amish cannot operate motor vehicles and often travel by horse-drawn buggie -- to take them to the home of one of the church bishops who had spoken out against him.

They then allegedly knocked on the door, pulled the man out of his house and assaulted him and his son, who tried to intervene. Prosecutors say the group pulled at and cut their beard hair, then took photographs of the victims before fleeing the scene en route to another attack.

An updated 10-count indictment tendered in March alleges that the men and women -- also members of the same extended family -- had tried to hide or destroy evidence, including a pair of shears and a bag of hair. Mullet was also charged with lying to federal agents when he denied knowing of an October assault. He faces life in prison.

In October, Mullet told the AP that although he didn't tell his relatives to commit the crimes, he did not stop them from being carried out.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/nebraska-woman-charlie-rogers-faked-anti-gay-hate/story?id=17057847,"A Nebraska woman was arrested for faking an anti-gay hate crime in which she claimed three masked men bound her, cut words into her skin and spray-painted slurs on her wall before setting her house on fire.

Charlie Rogers, 33, had told police that the three assailants broke into her Lincoln, Neb., home on July 22.

Rogers, a lesbian and a former University of Nebraska women's basketball star, became a face for anti-gay hate crimes after the alleged attack.

Reports of the alleged assault outraged the gay community, and hundreds of people participated in rallies outside the Nebraska capitol building, and at a park in Omaha.

But now police have charged Rogers with false reporting, disclosing evidence that contradicts her story and points to a faked attack.

Police found white gloves, a box cutter and zip ties in Rogers' home. She had originally told investigators that the gloves were the only item left behind by her attackers, and that they did not belong to her.

But Lincoln police learned that Rogers had visited Ace Hardware in LIncoln on July 17 and purchased the same three items. When confronted about the supplies, Rogers admitted to buying all of them except the gloves, which she said were not hers, according to police.

But DNA evidence suggested otherwise.

""The University of Nebraska Medical Center found DNA evidence that matched Ms. Rogers' inside the gloves that were left at the scene of the crime,"" Lincoln Police Chief Jim Peschong said at a news conference Tuesday.

""There were no male DNA markers found inside the gloves,"" he said.

Peschong said that Rogers had no explanation for why her DNA would be in the gloves.

The day after her visit to the hardware store, Rogers posted the following message on her Facebook page: ""So maybe I am too idealistic, but I believe way deep inside me that we can make things better for everyone. I will be a catalyst. I will do what it takes. I will. Watch me.""

Peschong also said that the circumstances surrounding the cuts on Rogers' body aroused suspicion.

""The cuttings on Ms. Rogers arms were either self-inflicted or she had allowed someone to do them,"" he said. ""The lines were too straight to be accomplished during a struggle, and ... the cuts were all in areas where the victim could have inflicted them herself.""

The cuts produced some blood, Peschong said, but that investigators found no blood on Rogers' bedspread. He also said that Rogers had told police that her two dogs were passive during the alleged attack, but Peschong said that the dogs were ""fairly aggressive"" toward officers investigating the scene.

Police arrested Rogers on Tuesday afternoon and charged her with false reporting. She pleaded not guilty and was released on her own recognizance, or in lieu of bail.

Rogers' attorney, Brett McArthur, did not respond to a request from ABC News for comment today but told the Associated Press that Rogers maintains the attack occurred and will be defending herself.

""This has been a very traumatic event for her, and having the focus of the investigation turn toward her has been really hard,"" McArthur told the AP. ""She has no reason to lie about what happened. She's pretty devastated, when you go to authorities and things kind of get turned around on you.""

Peschong said that the case would not affect the police department's trust in crime victims.

""Criminal incidents, especially hate crimes, are unique and viewed as such,"" he said. ""We do not want crime victims to hesitate reporting crimes in the future.""

Rogers' next court appearance is scheduled for Sept. 14. The false reporting charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $1000 fine.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/romney-slips-refers-to-shooting-site-as-sheik-temple/,"WEST DES MOINES, Iowa - Mitt Romney misspoke tonight when referring to the shooting in Wisconsin that took place at a Sikh temple, mistakenly using an Arab honorific in reference to the religious group.

Instead of saying that the shooting occurred at a Sikh temple, Romney referred to it as a sheik temple. Sheik is a Muslim term for the leader of a village or tribe. Sikhs are not Muslims.

""We obviously have challenges around the country. I was in Chicago earlier today. We had a moment of silence in honor of the people who lost their lives at that sheik temple,"" said Romney, speaking to a group of donors gathered at a fundraiser at a West Des Moines country club.

""I noted that it was a tragedy for many, many reasons. Among them are the fact that people, the sheik people are among the most peaceable and loving individuals you can imagine, as is their faith. And of course, the person who carried out this heinous act was a person motivated by racial hatred and religious intolerance. It's really, really a tragedy,"" he said.

Rick Gorka, a spokesman for Romney, later clarified that the candidate ""misspoke"" adding that it was the ""end of the day.""

Romney has been on the campaign trail since 7 a.m. this morning, holding one campaign event and three finance events as well as traveling from New Hampshire to Illinois to Iowa.

""He mispronounced similar sounding words,"" said Gorka. ""He was clearly referring to the tragedy in Wisconsin, you heard him talk about it earlier today in Chicago.""

Romney did lead a moment of silence in honor of the Wisconsin shootings that left six dead during a campaign event in Elk Grove Village outside of Chicago.

""Now, I know we've come today to talk about politics, but I'd like to have a moment of silence in honor of the people who lost their lives in Wisconsin at that tragic, tragic shooting at the Sikh Temple,"" Romney said. ""The tragedy is even more profound because the Sikh religion and the Sikh people are such peaceable, loving individuals and I think it's also more tragic because the shooter was apparently someone who was motivated by hate; hate based on race, hate based on religion.""

Members of the Sikh temple, which is an offshoot of the Hindu religion, have said that they are often confused with Muslims and since 9/11 have found themselves at times to be targets of hate crimes.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wisconsin-shooting-hate-crimes-sikhs-rise-911/story?id=16939326,"Amardeep Singh, the son of a physicist, was raised in New Jersey where he played Little League and his mother coached softball. Now, he is raising two sons in Hoboken, the third-generation of Sikhs to live in this country.

But because Singh is religious and wears his articles of faith -- a beard and a turban, he faces discrimination at every corner, especially since 9/11. Sunday's shootings in Oak Creek, Wisconsin have made it all the worse.

""People have said to me, 'Get that f'ing rag off your head,' 'Get out of here, terrorist,'"" he said. ""It's commentary they think is funny and it happens at least half a dozen times a year.""

Two days ago, while attending a meeting at his local library as a board member, he says he encountered a teenager who turned to a friend and said, ""Here comes bin Laden.""

""Being a Sikh in America means, in the very least, cat calls,"" said Singh, 41.

But today, in the aftermath of the most violent attack against Sikhs, it also means murder. On Sunday, seven people, including two priests and the gunman, were killed in Wisconsin in their gurdwara, or place of worship.

The shooter, Wade Michael Page, a former Army psychological operations specialist and a skinhead, was shot and killed by Wisconsin police at the scene.

Since 2001, the Sikh Coalition reports that more than 700 Americans have sought legal assistance after an incident of discrimination or bias -- ""everything from violent hate crime to employment discrimination, profiling at the airport or school bullying,"" according to Singh, who is one of the advocacy group's co-founders.

In the first month after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the coalition reports it logged more than 300 such acts around the country. But, Singh said, there are likely ""thousands more"" across the country that are never reported. The FBI does not track hate crimes against Sikhs.

""When you see a turban and a beard, the number one thing people think of is terrorism,"" he said.

The first post-9/11 classified hate crime against a Sikh was the murder of Balbir Singh Sodhi in Mesa, Ariz. After the terrorist attacks, Frank Silva Roque, an aircraft mechanic, told bystanders at a local restaurant that he wanted to ""shoot some rag heads,"" according to an essay in the Huffington Post.

Recent hate attacks include death threats against a Virginia Sikh family in March 2012; a violent assault on a Sikh in New York City in May 2011; the murders of two elderly Sikhs in Elk Grove, California in March 2011; and the near drowning of a Sikh student in West Texas in December 2009.

Sikhs first came to the United States in the 19th century, part of a wave of immigrants from South Asia who worked in the sawmills and became farmers and railroad workers.

The U.S. Census does not keep data on their numbers, but the coalition estimates there are anywhere from 500,000 to 700,000 practicing Sikhs in the country today, mostly in the San Francisco and New York areas.

""Oak Creek is not a large center and is not the typical immigration pattern,"" said Singh.

The Sikh Coalition said its surveys indicate 60 percent of all children in their community are teased in school. ""That was part of my growing up in America in New Jersey,"" said Singh.

Another 20 percent reported unwanted physical touching.

In 2008, a student at Hightstown High School in New Jersey set fire to a Sikh student's turban during a fire drill, singeing the boy's hair.

The turban and the beard are ""external signifiers of internal belief,"" said the coalition's education director, Manbeena Kaur. ""It is a constant reminder to be kind, generous and honest dealing with people and to be loving and compassionate.""

The turban also serves the practical function of covering the wearer's hair. Sikhs, both men and women, do not cut their hair.

""Much like the uniform of a police officer, it is a reminder to uphold the duties of the uniform … what I agreed to, to be a good human being,"" she said.

The Sikhs practice a monotheist religion based in peace that was founded in the Punjab region of India in 1469. There are more than 25 million followers worldwide.

Sikhism preaches a message of devotion, remembrance of God at all times, truthful living, social justice, while emphatically denouncing superstitions and blind rituals.

""The basic foundation principle is one God for all people and everyone is considered equal in the eyes of God -- which means gender, race and ethnicity,"" said Kaur.

Sikhs say one can get closer to God by practicing three things: remembering God, living truthfully and offering service to humanity. They say they are meant to uphold the values of honesty, compassion, generosity, humility, integrity and spirituality on a daily basis.

The five articles of faith include the unshorn hair [kes], comb for good hygiene [khangha], steel bracelet [kara], sword [kirpan] and soldier's shorts [kachhehra].

Since the Oak Creek attack, Kaur said the coalition has ""sort of been in emergency mode.""

Her colleague Singh flew out to Wisconsin today to help the Sikh community there and the families of the shooting victims.

""It's a very little community,"" said Singh. ""We want to be supportive and figure out how to lend a hand. We also want to respond to all public inquiries so the there is a better understanding of who we are in the history of the United States and our contributions.""",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/jewish-summer-campers-terrorized-pennsylvania/story?id=16863357,"Five people face charges for allegedly terrorizing a Jewish summer camp in Pennsylvania.

In three separate episodes earlier this month, three adults and two juveniles caused property damage as they sped dangerously through Camp Bonim in Wayne County in a pickup truck, shouting anti-Semitic epithets and firing paintball guns at campers and staff, District Attorney Janine Edwards said in a press release. The three adults were arrested Wednesday morning and face felony and misdemeanor charges, including ethnic intimidation, terroristic threats and assault.

""These children were terrorized and in fear for their lives by the actions of this group,"" Edwards said in the release. ""The vicious, cruel and obscene nature of the language hurled at the campers is unspeakable. Luckily none of the children suffered any serious physical injury, however, the emotional damage is immeasurable.""

A judge arraigned Tyler Spencer, an 18-year-old from Linden, Tenn., and set his bail at $200,000. Spencer is accused of attempting to hit campers as he drove the Ford-350 pickup truck carrying the group. Spencer's alleged accomplices, Mark Trail, 21, and Cassandra Robertson, 18, both of Wayne County, were held on $20,000 bail. A 17-year-old and a 16-year-old face juvenile court cases.

In the first episode on July 14, Spencer told police that he drove in circles at a high speed to damage several fields on the Bonim campus, according to a police affidavit obtained by ABC News. When he returned with the same group of passengers the next day, Spencer said they ripped the camp's mailbox out of the ground before driving into the camp.

Police said Mark Trail then yelled racial slurs such as ""You f***ing Jews go back where you came from"" and ""I'm gonna kill you, you f***ing Jews."" During that episode, 18-year-old camper Alan Rosen was struck in the leg by a shot from a paintball gun while walking near the camp's synagogue, according to the affidavit, filed by Pennsylvania State Trooper John Decker.

At around 2:30 a.m. the next morning, campers saw the group doing ""360s"" in the camp's quad area before the truck came chasing after one of them, according to the affidavit. The campers told police the truck only missed them by about 10 feet.

""Because of what goes on out there in the world, people get scared quick, and that's what they were trying to accomplish,"" said Dovid Presser, Camp Bonim's director.

Though the incidents quickly became the ""talk of the camp,"" he said, most of the camp's 300 children, which age from 6 to 20, did not appear terribly concerned for their safety in the days that followed. The camp's administrators, though, took the incidents very seriously, he said. A caretaker called Honesdale, Pa., police after the group's first intrusion on July 14, according to the affidavit.

On July 16, one day after the last incident at Camp Bonim, Spencer was charged with aggravated assault for allegedly driving into a counselor from the camp outside a local Turkey Hill store, breaking his leg. Spencer fled the scene, and was caught later that day by New York state police near Hancock, N.Y.

According to the affidavit, New York state police said the truck matched the description provided by Honesdale, Pa., police of the truck involved in the Camp Bonim crimes and the truck's occupants admitted to both those crimes and the hit-and-run at the Turkey Hill. Trail and Robertson gave Pennsylvania state police written statements acknowledging their guilt in the incidents at the camp and store.

Presser said the camp community was relieved to learn that the group had been apprehended, and that he was impressed with the way law enforcement handled the case.

""They did whatever they could. We could see right away that they were working on it,"" he said. Wayne County is home to more than 30 summer camps, many of them drawing children from around the Northeast. District Attorney Edwards said in a statement to the press that her office ""want[s] it known that Wayne County citizens value our camps. We want our camps to be safe.""

The group is also being charged with damaging the grounds of an elementary school in nearby Waymart, Pa.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/nebraska-lesbian-mutilated-anti-gay-hate-crime/story?id=16846781,"Nebraska cops are hunting three masked men who carved derogatory epithets into the body of an openly gay woman.

""Three men wearing masks, that's all the victim was able to provide,"" said Officer Katie Flood of the Lincoln Police Department.

""Derogatory terms associated with her sexual orientation were painted inside her home,"" the officer said. News reports state that crude words referring to her sexual orientation were carved into her body.

""We will not release what was written on her body,"" Flood said.

The woman, who is 33, was bound, gagged and mutilated early Sunday and the three attackers splashed the victim's home with gasoline and tried to set it on fire, scorching a floor, police reports state.

The attack is being classified as a hate crime.

""According to our policy any offense is classified as a hate crime when it appears biased regarding someone's sexual orientation,"" Flood said.

The officer refused to divulge additional details, telling ABC News, ""We are not releasing any further details.""

A neighbor of the woman was appalled by the attack.

""When someone takes the time to handcuff someone with a zip tie and carve derogatory comments or words into somebody else's body, that's sheer hate and at this point, this is a hate crime,"" a neighbor who declined to be identified told ABC affiliate KLKN.

The victim is openly homosexual, said her friend Erin Thompson who spoke with the Omaha World-Herald. She said that the attackers slashed the word ""dyke"" among two other epithets into the victim's stomach and arm.

Hundreds of Lincoln residents came out to show their support for the victim, holding a vigil in front of the State Capitol Building Sunday evening. ""Hate crimes are despicable and appalling to me and to all Lincoln residents,"" the city's mayor said in a statement.

Among those present at the vigil were members of Lincoln's gay and lesbian community.

""Someone hurt someone in my family – my LGBT family,"" one person told ABC's KLKN.

Some residents fear this may be a setback for the local gay and lesbian community, one that that only two months prior saw local officials approve a measure that would ensure fair treatment of gay and transgendered residents in housing and job applications.

""Another reason it's difficult to come out in Lincoln,"" wrote one commenter on Outlinc's Facebook page, a local non-profit organization that supports the community's LGBT community.

""Many in our community are understandably experiencing a great deal of sadness, anger, and confusion,"" said Tyler Richard, President of Outlinc, in a statement on the organization's homepage.",abcnews.com,True

Police released a second sketch of the suspect today, which was refined from the first version Chapa worked with a forensic artist to create.

""It is unusual to go back and refine a suspect drawing,"" Wright said. ""But in this case, our eyewitness sustained a brain injury that initially affected her ability to communicate effectively. The good news is she has made exceptional progress. Her sight and speech have improved and she can now interact with the artist much better.""

Wright said Chapa had requested a second meeting with the sketch artist to refine the image.

The physical description of the suspect did not change from the first version Chapa provided, Wright said.

The assailant is described as a white male in his 20s, 5 foot 8 inches tall, thin build, 140 pounds, with brown hair and a scruffy beard.

Chapa and her girlfriend, Mollie Olgin, were both shot in the head at Violet Andrews Park in Portland on June 22.

Olgin was found dead next to her girlfriend by a couple the next morning. Police believe the women were shot sometime around midnight.

The shooting is not being investigated as a hate crime.

A close friend of Olgin remembered the last time she saw her ""bubbly"" friend and how happy she was. She said Olgin proudly showed off a ring that said ""Mollie Loves Mary,"" which is Chapa's first name, though she goes by her middle name, Kristene.

""If you were her friend or [she] barely met you, she'd give you the world and then some,"" said the friend, who did not want to be identified.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/trayvon-martin-shooter-george-zimmerman-called-overzealous-soft/story?id=16762044,"A Florida investigator told FBI agents weighing possible civil rights violations against the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed teenager Trayvon Martin that he believed George Zimmerman's actions were based on Martin's attire rather than skin color, describing him as ""overzealous"" but a ""soft guy"" with a ""little hero complex.""

Sanford Police Department investigator Chris Serino ""believes that when Zimmerman saw Martin in a hoody, Zimmerman took it upon himself to view Martin as acting suspicious,"" according to documents released today by the State Attorney's Office.

The documents in the case also show that in seeking to determine whether the killing of Martin can be classified as a hate crime, the FBI interviewed Zimmerman's former co-workers, friends and neighbors. One neighbor called him ""culturally rounded"" with no racial prejudices, as did Joe Oliver, the African-American family friend and co-worker who came to Zimmerman's defense in the initial days of the public outcry.

But the documents that include surveillance video, seven calls from Zimmerman to the Sanford Police department from April 2011 to January 2012, photos of Martin's attire after the shooting and more than 200 pages of investigator reports also show a man almost obsessively involved with patrolling his community.

The documents also shed light on Zimmerman's allegedly racist comment. In his call to Sanford Police that night, Zimmerman is heard muttering under his breath something that to many sounded like ""f---ing coon."" But a Sanford officer told FBI officials about the presence of several local gangs who call themselves goons.

The public also sees, for the first time, Martin's now iconic hoodie, as well as the sweatshirt he wore underneath. The bullet hole is clearly visible, encircled by a bloodstain.

Zimmerman reached out to police in 2011 to set up the neighborhood watch program. The Homeowner's Association had asked Zimmerman to be the coordinator and he was handed a handbook and was explained the duties and responsibilities to which he and other coordinators should adhere, according to the documents.

In calls made to the Sanford Police Department in 2011 and early 2012, the criminal justice major can be heard complaining about a spate of burglaries in the community. He also alerted the police of minor occurrences, including one call that informed police that a neighbor had left their ""garage door open.""

In a statement provided by Zimmerman's ex-fiancée, she told police that Zimmerman hit her in the mouth for chewing gum, and that a few weeks later there was an incident in which Zimmerman refused to leave her house and, she said, lied to police about a scratch he had incurred from the dog, saying that she instead scratched him. The couple were engaged for a year before calling it off.

She noted Zimmerman had aspired to become a police officer and that while he had a temper, she did not consider him to be the kind of person to put himself in harm's way.

The documents also go into detail about an incident in 2005 in Orange County involving Zimmerman and off-duty officers that resulted in his allegedly shoving one of them and displaying ""an angry demeanor"" even after the officers identified themselves. He was promptly arrested but charges were never filed.

As for Martin, the new evidence paints a clearer picture of the final days of his life. In the day before he was killed, he accompanied his cousin to a football game. His father later gave him a few dollars to go to the movies but he never went. The next morning, Martin and his cousin, who says they spent time together almost every weekend, went to a convenience store and that was the last they saw each other.

When the cousin was later approached by investigators about who was screaming in 911 audio recordings the night of the shooting, he said he could swear ""on a stack of Bibles that it was Trayvon.""

Mary Kristene Chapa, 18, and her girlfriend, Mollie Olgin, 19, were both shot in the head at Violet Andrews Park in Portland, Texas, on June 22.

Chapa is recovering in the hospital and has regained consciousness, although it was unclear whether she had been interviewed by police.

Olgin was found dead next to her girlfriend by a couple the next morning. Police believe the women were shot sometime around midnight.

Olgin's friends and family honored her in a memorial service on Friday, followed by a candlelight vigil in support of both women.

A close friend of Olgin remembered the last time she saw her ""bubbly"" friend and how happy she was. She said Olgin proudly showed off a ring that said ""Mollie Loves Mary,"" which is Chapa's first name, though she goes by her middle name, Kristene.

""If you were her friend or [she] barely met you, she'd give you the world and then some,"" said the friend, who did not want to be identified.

Police announced Thursday that a witness had come forward and described the suspect as a white male in his 20s with dark hair. The suspect is estimated to be 5-foot-8 and weighs approximately 140 pounds, police said in a statement.

""There continues to be no evidence that the attack was motivated by the victims' sexual orientation,"" Portland Police Chief Randy Wright said.

The Portland Police Department is being assisted by federal law enforcement agencies, the Texas Rangers and Texas Department of Public Safety.

Several vehicles were at Violet Andrews Park the night of the shooting, according to witnesses. Officers are appealing to anyone who was in the area that night to come forward with any information they may have, no matter how inconsequential it may be seem.

Mario Olgin, Mollie's father, told ABC News' Corpus Christi affiliate that he is hopeful the person who did this to his daughter would be apprehended.

""She was happy,"" Mario Olgin said. ""Justice will be served.""",abcnews.com,True

Detectives are constructing a timeline of events, processing bullet casings found at the scene and are interviewing witnesses to understand what led up to the shootings of Mollie Olgin, 19, and Mary Kristene Chapa, 18, in the small town of Portland, Texas, which is located a few miles from Corpus Christi.

""The families are devastated, obviously, but there's really no information that we've been able to determine yet that would indicate there was anyone who would want to do this to either of those girls,"" Police Chief Randy Wright told ABC News' Corpus Christi affiliate.

On Saturday morning, a couple discovered the bodies of the two women, who friends say were dating, in knee-high grass near a scenic lookout at Violet Andrews Park, police said.

Police believe both women were shot in the head around midnight. Olgin was pronounced dead at the scene. Chapa was taken to a local hospital and has since regained consciousness.

""The evidence suggests that there was a third party or parties involved,"" Wright said.

Friends of the couple told local media they had been dating for five months.

Vigils across the country have been planned to honor the two women.

Cleve Jones, a gay rights activist, noted the timing of the crime, which happened during Pride weekend.

""Last Friday, as millions of LGBT people and their allies were celebrating Pride, something awful happened in Portland, Texas. We need to respond publicly to this tragedy,"" he wrote. ""Whoever shot Mary Christine Chapa and Mollie Judith Olgin, whatever the motive, regardless of where it happened, two beautiful girls were shot and one was killed. We need to honor the memory of Mollie and pray for the recovery of Mary.""

Mary Kristene Chapa was last listed in critical but stable condition

Ravi, 20, began his 30-day sentence at the Middlesex County Jail with five days of credit for good behavior and five days of credit for working, according to the AP.

After his conviction for bias intimidation, Judge Glenn Berman also sentenced Ravi to three years probation, ordered him to complete 300 hours of community service and attend counseling programs for cyber-bullying and alternative lifestyles.

Ravi must also pay a $10,000 assessment to the probation department in increments of $300 per month beginning Aug. 1. The money will go to groups that support victims of bias crimes.

Ravi, who is not a U.S. citizen, also faced the possibility of being deported, but U.S. immigration officials said this week that they will not pursue deportation for the Indian native.

Prosecutors have been asking an appeals court for a longer sentence while Ravi is appealing his conviction.

""I do not believe he hated Tyler Clementi,"" the judge told the court when Ravi was sentenced. ""He had no reason to, but I do believe he acted out of colossal insensitivity.""

Berman berated Ravi for not apologizing for his actions.

""I heard this jury say, 'guilty' 288 times--24 questions, 12 jurors. That's the multiplication,"" Berman said. ""I haven't heard you apologize once.""

Ravi was convicted of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, witness tampering and hindering arrest, stemming from his role in activating the webcam to peek at Clementi's date with a man in the dorm room on Sept. 19, 2010. Ravi was also convicted of encouraging others to spy during a second date, on Sept. 21, 2010, and intimidating Clementi for being gay.

Thapelo Makhutle, 24, was found dead in his apartment last week in the town of Kuruman. His body was severely mutilated, according to a friend and director of the LEGBO Northern Cape gay rights advocacy group where Makhutle volunteered.

""We and his family are just devastated,"" said LEGBO Director Shaine Griqua. ""This has a very negative impact on the gay community here. Many live in fear and are afraid for their security. Now it is worse. We are trying to counsel them through this fear crisis.""

Griqua said another friend saw two men arguing with Makhutle about his sexuality the night he was killed. He said the attackers broke down the door to Makhutle's room in order to kill him, nearly severed his head, and cut off his genitals. Northern Cape police told the South African Press Association they are still looking for suspects.

Makhutle was recently crowned Miss Gay Kuruman and participated in the Kimberley Out in Africa Gay and Lesbian Festival.

""He was a friend you could always count on to cheer you up and help you get through any difficult time,"" said Griqua. ""He was openly gay. He was proud of who he was and believed that freedom in South Africa was attainable.""

South Africa is the only country in Africa with constitutional protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation, yet gays and lesbians in rural areas and black townships are frequently victims of discrimination and violence.

http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/06/proud-obama-makes-pride-month-appeal-to-gays/,"LOS ANGELES - President Obama claimed the mantle of champion for the LGBT community on Wednesday night, telling a group of 600 gay and lesbian donors at a star-studded fundraiser that he ""could not be prouder"" of his administration's work to advance fairness and equality.

From the effort to lift an HIV/AIDS travel ban, to passage of a hate crimes law and repeal of ""don't ask don't tell,"" Obama credited his friends and family, staff and military service members as the inspiration behind his advocacy for gay rights in the White House.

""It's something that I'm personally very proud of,"" he said of the accomplishments.

One of those sources of inspiration introduced Obama - Dr. Vito Imbasciani, a urological surgeon and colonel in the U.S. Army National Guard who served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Imabasciani, who is gay, explained that it was his commander-in-chief who allowed him to finally ""be himself"" after serving for 26 years.

""Until last year, the price of my service was to live a lie,"" the soft-spoken Imbasciani said. ""But not anymore.""

""Thanks to the unyielding efforts of President Obama I can serve my country openly with my family by my side,"" he added, referring to the repeal of ""don't ask don't tell."" Imbasciani said he and his partner have two adopted children of Mexican descent.

Invoking ""Vito's story,"" President Obama said that his administration's record of progress for gays and lesbians over the past three years is ""just one more step"" in a broader movement for greater equality for all Americans.

""It's part of our history of trying to make this union a little bit more perfect,"" Obama said. ""In successive ways, the history, the scope of this country has always been to further broaden the meaning of citizenship, to include more and more people. To give better and better expression to our highest aspirations, to make the country more fair, and more just and more equal.""

While the president did not specifically address his rival Mitt Romney's record on gay rights, he did suggest the former Republican governor would be much less supportive.

""[There is a] fundamentally different vision about what's going on,"" Obama said of his opponent's campaign. ""And a lot of this debate's going to be about the economy, but also obviously there's a different vision about how we create an inclusive America.

""I refuse to let anybody re-impose a law that would force Vito back into the shadows when he's serving on our behalf and our safety and our security,"" Obama said to resounding applause. ""That's not something I will tolerate.""

Romney, it should be noted, has not publicly called for re-imposing a ban on gays serving openly in the military. During a November 2011 primary debate, Romney suggested that he would allow the repeal to stand, saying ""That's already occurred and I'm not planning on reversing that at this stage.""

Gay and lesbian supporters have been some of Obama's most active and generous supporters, with many doubly energized when the president announced newfound support for same-sex marriage in an interview with ABC News last month.

The LGBT Leadership Council Gala at the Regent Beverly Wilshire tonight and a subsequent fundraiser at the home of ""Glee"" creator Ryan Murphy and his partner David Miller were expected to raise north of $2.5 million combined for the Obama Victory Fund, according to figures provided by the Obama campaign.

Comedian Ellen DeGeneres and ""Glee"" star Darren Criss entertained the crowd at the Wilshire before Obama took the stage. While the president spoke, many same-sex couples in the crowd had their arms around each other while others snapped photos with iPhones and cameras.

""This is going to be a very close election,"" Obama said. ""Not because people buy what they're selling, but just because a lot of folks have given up feeling that anything is going to make their lives better.

""But when folks come together and say it's time for a change, change happens,"" he said.",abcnews.com,True

The parents of Tyler Clementi, the 18-year-old Rutgers student who killed himself in 2009, slammed Dharun Ravi's apology for spying on Clementi's gay date as ""no apology at all, but a public relations piece,"" in a statement released today.

Ravi released an official apology and statement on Tuesday to notify Judge Glen Berman that he would begin serving his 30-day sentence in jail today for charges of bias intimidation and invasion of privacy. Ravi was found guilty of spying on his roommate Clementi's sexual tryst with another man, known as ""M.B."" in the first weeks of their freshmen year. Ravi then sent Twitter messages and told friends about the encounter, and was found guilty of encouraging them to watch as Clementi and M.B. had a second date.

Clementi killed himself days later by jumping off of New York's George Washington Bridge. His parents, who read tearful statements at Ravi's sentencing earlier this month, said today that Berman did not sentence Ravi harshly enough for the crimes Ravi committed against Clementi.

""We have respect for Judge Berman and we appreciate the manner in which he presided over the criminal trial of Mr. Ravi.

Rutgers student Dharun Ravi released an apologetic letter today admitting that spying on his roommate's gay tryst was ""insensitive"" and ""stupid.""

Ravi also said he will surrender and begin his 30-day prison sentence on Thursday, despite an ongoing appeal for a longer prison sentence by the prosecution.

Ravi's attorney, Steven Altman, released a statement from the 21-year-old, who last week was sentenced to the prison term, three years probation, 300 hours of community service, and a fine of more than $10,000. He was convicted of spying and hate crimes against his former freshmen dorm roommate Tyler Clementi and a man known only as ""M.B."" with whom Clementi had sexual encounters in September 2010.

Dharun Ravi's Statement

The Middlesex, N.J., jury found Ravi guilty of using a webcam to spy on one sexual encounter and then using social media and conversation to spread the word about Clementi's sexuality. Clementi killed himself by jumping off New York's George Washington Bridge just days after he discovered that Ravi had seen him on the date with M.B.

Prosecutors are appealing the sentencing decision in order to pursue a longer prison sentence, but Ravi writes in the letter that he will turn himself in Thursday to ""hopefully complete the sentence as soon as possible. It's the only way I can go on with my life. ""

During sentencing, Clementi's parents read tearful statements condemning Ravi for never having shown ""a lack of remorse"" for spying on Clementi. Judge Glenn Berman, who oversaw the trial, also scolded Ravi during sentencing.

""I heard this jury say, 'guilty' 288 times-24 questions, 12 jurors. That's the multiplication,"" Berman said. ""I haven't heard you apologize once.""

In his newly-released statement, however, Ravi claimed that he ""accept(s) responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid, and childish choices that I made on Sept. 19, 20120, and Sept. 21, 2010.""

Ravi's statement did not address the Clementi family. Instead, he states, ""I apologize to everyone affected by those choices.""

He also maintained that his actions were not motivated by hate or bigotry.

NOTABLES:

BACK TO THE FUTURE: All week long, President Obama's ad makers have kept a laser-like focus on Mitt Romney's business dealings at Bain Capital while the Romney team has made it clear that they would rather Bain remain in the past. Team Romney insists that the well-worn Bain attack is not sticking, but the Obama folks say they are just starting to make their case.

FLOODING THE ZONE IN WISCONSIN: Three GOP governors - Nikki Haley, Bobby Jindal, and Bob McDonnell - will head to Wisconsin over the next two weeks to campaign with embattled governor Scott Walker who faces a June 5 recall election. Meanwhile, the Democratic Governors Association announced this morning that it is sending an additional $1 million to the DGA-affiliated group, Greater Wisconsin, to support ads airing statewide, as well as get-out-the-vote efforts.

VEEP BEAT: In today's Veep Beat, Rob Portman acknowledges he's more boring than even he thought, Marco Rubio decries the divisive state of politics and Chris Christie opens up beach season in Atlantic City. Bonus: Does Donald Trump want a look for the VP spot? (Answer: Yes.) http://abcn.ws/LHG4NS

THE NOTE:

The Obama campaign wants to turn back the clock. The Romney campaign wants to hit fast forward.

All week long the difference in messages coming from the two teams has been striking. Obama's ad makers have kept a laser-like focus on Mitt Romney's business dealings at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded nearly three decades ago.

And today, the Obama team is out with a new video looking back at Romney's memorable appearance last year at the Iowa State Fair when he declared, ""corporations are people, my friend."" (WATCH: http://bit.ly/KjjhEs)

Like the Bain ads, Romney's heated exchange in Iowa last summer is meant to frame the image of the former Massachusetts governor as an out-of-touch capitalist, which President Obama's campaign has been hammering home all week. The president visits the Iowa State Fairgrounds later today.

Meanwhile, Romney appears to have little interest in re-living the past. And, after all, why should he? As we've noted before, every day Romney is not talking about the country's economic woes is a day that he's off message.

In an interview with Time Magazine's Mark Halperin, Romney attempted to swat away questions about his record at Bain: ""Well of course, I'd like to also focus on his record,"" Romney said of Obama in response to a question inviting him to weigh in on his time in private equity.

And to underscore that strategy, the Romney campaign unveiled a new campaign ad this morning - part of their ""Day One"" series - that attempts to answer, ""What would a Romney Presidency be like?"" (WATCH: http://mi.tt/MppsXX)

""Day one, President Romney announces deficit reductions, ending the Obama era of big government, helping secure our kids' futures,"" the ad's narrators says. ""President Romney stands up to China on trade and demands they play by the rules. President Romney begins repealing job-killing regulations that are costing the economy billions.""

So, as Romney looks forward to inauguration day, the Obama campaign plans to continue chipping away at his record from years earlier. Team Romney insists that the Bain attack is not sticking, but the Obama folks say they are just starting to build their case.

POWELL VS. ROMNEY'S FOREIGN-POLICY TEAM: A HISTORY. Colin Powell on Wednesday criticized Mitt Romney's foreign-policy sensibility - more specifically, his advisers and his thoughts on Russia - and in doing so, the former secretary of state resurfaced old conflicts with the Republican candidate's team. Two names likely stand out for Powell: John Bolton and Robert Kagan. During Bolton's 2005 Senate confirmation as U.N. ambassador, anonymous sources informed the Washington Post that Bolton had prevented a 2003 memo, on international support for U.S.-backed investigation of Iran's nuclear program, from reaching Powell's desk. Powell, meanwhile, privately urged Republican senators to vote Bolton down. Romney's advisers aren't exclusively neocons, but Bolton leads a faction with which Romney usually sides, the New York Times' David Sanger reported this month. Romney's team also includes Robert Kagan, another prominent neocon and Project for the New American Century member who urged George W. Bush not to appoint Powell to head the State Department, in a 2000 Washington Post op-ed. http://abcn.ws/KSda8v

It has a margin of error of +/- 4 percent. 73 percent of likely voters said they were aware of the controversy involving Warren's claim of Cherokee heritage and minority status, and 69 percent said it was not a significant story. The numbers represent a seven-percentage-point improvement for Warren since the last Suffolk poll taken in February, when Brown had a nine point lead (49 percent to Warren's 40 percent). http://bit.ly/Lb7xoX

MEET THE WEALTHY 21-YEAR-OLD WHO LAUNCHED A PRO-RON-PAUL SUPER PAC. Bloomberg's Greg Giroux reports: ""John Ramsey became old enough to buy a Carlsberg nine months ago. The 21-year-old college student from east Texas isn't old enough to serve in Congress. … Ramsey is leaving a mark on U.S. politics that may outlast his political mentor and presidential candidate, Paul. The college senior spent $1.3 million of his own money to create a super-political action committee, Liberty for All Super PAC, that backs candidates who endorse what Ramsey calls ""freedom philosophy."" The dogma includes policies championed by Paul, such as supporting free-market economics, protecting civil liberties, slashing government spending and opposing most U.S. military action. … His interest in economics and finance comes from his grandfather, Justin Robert Howard, a banker who died on Thanksgiving 2010 and left a fortune to his survivors, including Ramsey and his two older siblings. http://bloom.bg/ JJp2hj

From ABC's Devin Dwyer: In a new five-minute, documentary-style campaign video, Obama appeals to his supporters by casting himself as the most progressive U.S. president on gay rights issues in American history. He also reflects personally on how he was inspired to become an advocate through relationships with LGBT friends and family, U.S. military service members, and the mother of anti-gay hate crime victim Matthew Shepard. … The film is narrated by actress Jane Lynch, who stars in the hit show ""Glee."" http://abcn.ws/L9ifMJ

OBAMA TO CADETS: A 'NEW FEELING ABOUT AMERICA.' ABC' Mary Bruce and Devin Dwyer report on Obama's speech to graduating Air Force Academy cadets on Wednesday: ""The world stage is not a popularity contest,"" Obama said as he defended his foreign policy decisions. ""As a nation, we have vital interests, and we will do what is necessary to defend the country we love-even if it's unpopular. But make no mistake, how we're viewed in the world has consequences-for our national security, for your lives. ""There's a new feeling about America"" because of the progress made by his administration. There's a new confidence in our leadership. And when people around the world are asked 'Which country do you admire most?'…one nation comes out on top-the United States of America,"" he said. http://abcn.ws/JyrWGj

AIR FORCE ACADEMY GRADUATES FIRST OPENLY GAY CADETS. From ABC's Devin Dwyer: ""The whole thing is we don't want to be identified as anything different,"" said Trish Heller, who heads the Blue Alliance, an association of LGBT Air Force Academy alumni. ""We want to serve, to be professional and to be symbols of what it means to be Air Force Academy graduates."" Heller said her group had connected with at least four members of the class of 2012 receiving diplomas today who had come out publicly as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. There were likely others, but they preferred to keep a low-profile, she said. http://abcn.ws/Jotvp8

REPUBLICANS SET TO GO AFTER MESSINA. Roll Call's Jonathan Strong reports: With Republicans ramping up their messaging on a health care investigation and set to unveil information that might ensnare President Barack Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, Democrats say they'll return fire by targeting Barry Jackson, a top aide to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), over his small role in two George W. Bush-era scandals. … Republicans say Messina might have violated the Presidential Records Act by using a personal email account to discuss official White House business. The allegations about the records law stem from a larger investigation into deals the White House made to help pass the health care overhaul. Messina, who was White House deputy chief of staff before moving to the re-election campaign last year, played a key role in those negotiations. … That investigation and another probe, into the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, revealed several interactions between Jackson and lobbyists who worked for Abramoff's firm. http://bit.ly/KA0FMZ

BAIN DRAIN. The New York Times' Nicholas Confessore reports that Obama's Bain talk may jeopardize relationships and money: ""At stake are not only a political and policy relationship Democrats have nurtured over decades with the financial services industry, but the millions of dollars in campaign cash that have come with it. Already this year, securities and investment firms have given Republicans 57 percent of their donations, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the party's highest share since the center began tabulating campaign money. Mr. Obama has raised millions of dollars on Wall Street, but far less than he did four years ago."" http://nyti.ms/KVtohk

HALEY CREEPED OUT BY PINATA BASHING. After a YouTube video surfaced of a South Carolina union leader bashing a pinata adorned with the South Carolina governor's face, Politico's MJ Lee reports on more of Haley's reaction: ""'It's creepy. I still hurt every time I see it,' Haley said to Greta Van Susteren of Fox News. 'This is not typical of South Carolinians. This is typical of union thugs.'"" http://politi.co/ KNrBif

BIRTHER BEAT: AZ SECRETARY OF STATE GIVES IT UP. The Associated Press's Jacques Billaud reports: ""Arizona's secretary of state said Wednesday that Hawaii's official verification of President Barack Obama's birth records meets necessary requirements, meaning the president's name will appear on Arizona's ballot in the fall. The inquiry launched recently by Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett gave official weight to a long-simmering political controversy generated by those who say that Obama was not born in the U.S. and therefore is ineligible to hold the nation's highest office."" http://bit.ly/KbGVnF

VEEP BEAT: Our daily look at all the action on the veepstakes front, brought to you by ABC's Arlette Saenz ( @ArletteSaenz ):

PORTMAN'S PROSPECTS. From The Washington Post's Michael Leahy: ""Romney and Ryan had met privately last autumn to talk about economic policy and deficits, said someone close to the candidate. Although Portman, he added, was 'much admired' by the Romney team and remained very high on the VP list, the view among several Romney insiders was that the chemistry between their leader and Portman 'had not been great - not bad, he's a nice guy, but just not great.' Still, only one man knows Portman's standing for certain. And Mitt Romney isn't saying anything about the process. 'Senator Portman is a proven leader and a trusted fiscal conservative,' says Ryan Williams, a Romney campaign spokesman. 'He played an important role during Governor Romney's successful primary campaign in Ohio.' Portman remains as disciplined and self-effacing as ever. Asked the same question that was put to Christie the day before about whether he would accept the vice presidential nomination, Portman declined to take the bait. He paused. No political figure can pause longer or answer more deliberatively than Portman. Icebergs could form in his cool hesitation. 'I don't know,' he said finally. 'My sense is .?.?. [lengthy pause], given all the various .?.?. [lengthier pause] .?.?. candidates he's looking at, that it's unlikely that question will ever be posed. He's got some great candidates.'"" http://wapo.st/KQnayZ

RUBIO DECRIES DIVISIVE POLITICS: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., lamented the divisive state of politics Wednesday, accusing politicians of fostering a culture of ineffectiveness and division and placing the blame for much of this with a veiled swipe at President Obama.""Last three and a half years after our elections, irrespective of how you felt about how they turned out, we all had hope that this nation would embark at a new moment, where somehow we would rise above the petty politics of the moment and have a real honest societal wide conversation about what kind of country we want to be, what kind of role we want to play in the world, and what kind of role we want our government to play in our lives. Well any hope of that is now gone,"" Rubio said during his keynote address at the Latino Coalition's Small Business Summit in Washington, D.C. Wednesday afternoon. ""What you have today is nothing less than a whole sale effort to pit one group of Americans against each other on issue after issue."" http://abcn.ws/KhspsW

TRUMP CHIMES IN ON VP: PICK ME! Donald Trump weighed in on the veepstakes race in an interview with NewsMax Wednesday. ""You have a lot of really good candidates,"" Trump said to Newsmax. ""Chris Christie's a great guy. He's a friend of mine. You really have someone really good there. Rob Portman, who I don't know, but I hear fantastic things about. Certainly he's been very well vetted over the years. He's a professional who's been there a long time. He's been through it. He knows the game and he's a very, very solid citizen… ""On a younger side, you could look at Sen. Rubio, who I think could help with Hispanics. But he is young, and I think he sort of doesn't want to go through it and doesn't want to do it."" But Trump joked about his own potential candidacy telling NewsMax with a smile. ""They have a lot of very good people…Probably the best choice of all would be Donald Trump."" http://bit.ly/LHl4H6

http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/obama-pride-president-courts-gay-vote-with-jane-lynch-narrated-video/,"President Obama is marking Gay Pride Month with a concerted push to mobilize lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender voters, who his re-election campaign believes are a key constituency in hotly contested swing states.

In a new five-minute, documentary-style campaign video, Obama appeals to his supporters by casting himself as the most progressive U.S. president on gay rights issues in American history. He also reflects personally on how he was inspired to become an advocate through relationships with LGBT friends and family, U.S. military service members, and the mother of anti-gay hate crime victim Matthew Shepard.

""Meeting people like Judy Shepard, and not only hearing the heartbreaking tragedy of Matthew but also the strength and determination she brought to making sure that never happens to young people anywhere in the country again,"" is what he says moved him.

Obama also said the stories of gay and lesbian service members who have fought and died for the country also ""made me passionate.""

""I don't think there was a single moment LGBT issues became important to me. It was an accumulation of a lifetime of friends, family and people I've met who have helped me understand how the fight for LGBT rights is consistent"" with America, he said.

The film is narrated by actress Jane Lynch, who stars in the hit show ""Glee.""

""That passion drove him to make more significant advances for LGBT Americans than any other president who came before him,"" Lynch says.

Earlier today, the Obama campaign also kicked off a grassroots organizing campaign specifically targeting gay voters. ""LGBT Americans for Obama"" will focus on enlisting volunteers and turning out votes in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Nevada and Michigan, the campaign said.

Obama campaign strategists believe the president's achievements in gay rights, coupled with his newfound support for same-sex marriage, is one of the strongest selling points of his first term.

They regularly rattle off the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" signing the Hate Crime Prevention Act into law, ceasing a defense of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, and executive actions to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity in the federal government.",abcnews.com,True

http://abcnews.go.com/US/rutgers-trial-dharun-ravi-make-statement-sentencing/story?id=16394014,"Former Rutgers student Dharun Ravi was sentenced to 30 days in jail by a New Jersey judge today for spying on his roommate's gay tryst. Ravi's freshman roommate Tyler Clementi committed suicide days later.

""I do not believe he hated Tyler Clementi,"" Judge Glenn Berman told the court. ""He had no reason to, but I do believe he acted out of colossal insensitivity.""

Ravi, 20, must report to Middlesex Adult Correctional Center on May 31 at 9 a.m. for his 30 day jail term. He was also sentenced to three years probation, ordered to complete 300 hours of community service and attend counseling programs for cyber-bullying and alternative lifestyles.

He must also pay a $10,000 assessment to the probation department in increments of $300 per month beginning Aug. 1. The money will go to victims of bias crimes. The judge recommended that Ravi, who was born in India and is here on a green card, not be deported.

""I heard this jury say, 'guilty' 288 times--24 questions, 12 jurors. That's the multiplication,"" Berman said. ""I haven't heard you apologize once.""

Berman also berated Ravi by saying that most defendants stand when a judge speaks to them, but told him, ""Keep your seat."" The judge called Ravi's pre-sentencing letter ""unimpressive.""

Ravi, who was expected to make a statement to the packed New Brunswick, N.J. courtroom, declined to speak before the sentence was read.

The prosecution, which sought a significant prison term, indicated it will appeal the judge's sentence.

Ravi was convicted of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, witness tampering and hindering arrest, stemming from his role in activating the webcam to peek at Clementi's date with a man in the dorm room on Sept. 19, 2010. Ravi was also convicted of encouraging others to spy during a second date, on Sept. 21, 2010, and intimidating Clementi for being gay.

Before the judge's sentencing, Ravi's mother delivered an emotional plea for leniency during which she and her son both broke into tears. At the end of her plea, Ravi's mother threw herself on her son, sobbing and hugging him.

""Dharun's dreams are shattered,"" his mother Sabitha Ravi cried. ""And he has been living in hell for the past 20 months. It's hard for me to say that my son is sitting here physically alive in front of everyone...I feel that Dharun has really suffered enough for the past two years in the media.""

Sabitha Ravi said that her son lives an isolated life studying, has lost 25 pounds and only eats one meal a day to ""suppress his hunger.""

""This case has been tried, has been treated and exists today, as if it's a murder case,"" defense attorney Steve Altman said. He spoke about the need for Ravi to be defended and looked at the Clementi family when he said, ""I know that family hates me. I'm a demon to them.""

In March, Ravi was found guilty of a bias crime for using a webcam to spy on Clementi.

Clementi's family bitterly asked the judge today to sentence Ravi to prison time.

Clementi's father, Joseph Clementi, told the judge, ""One of Tyler's last actions was to check Ravi's Twitter page"" and noted that his son checked his roommate's Twitter page 37 times before leaving the Rutgers campus and driving to the George Washington Bridge where he jumped to his death.

Ravi was convicted of a hate crime for using a webcame to spy on Clementi during a sexual liaison with a man identified only as ""MB"" and announcing what he saw on Twitter. Ravi put out another tweet when he heard Clementi was having a second date with MB.

Joseph Clementi said that Ravi decided his son ""wasn't deserving the respect of basic human decency"" and ""was below him"" because Tyler Clementi was gay.

""He did it in a cold calculating manner and then he tried to cover it up,"" the father, who had to pause to compose himself, said. Clementi's mother Jane Clementi cried in the front row has her husband spoke.

The father accused Ravi of having any ""lack of remorse.""

Tyler Clementi's mother Jane Clementi recalled the day she helped her ""excited"" son move into his Rutgers dorm room and the coldness Ravi showed by not getting up from his computer to say hello.

Dharun Ravi Showed No Remorse, Tyler Clementi's Family Stated

""He never even paused to acknowledge that Tyler was in the room,"" she said. ""He never stopped what he was doing, no greeting, no smile, no recognition, no nothing.""

Jane Clementi said that though she initially thought Ravi may have been stressed or busy, she said she realized during trial that that was not the case.

She heard during the trial that Ravi had not reached out to her son on Facebook or via email, but, rather, had used his computer skills to plug Clementi's email address into various computer programs to discover what websites he frequented and to discover that Tyler was gay.

""He never really knew Tyler, not the smart, kind, articulate, humble, funny, talented, caring, thoughtful, generous, trustworthy and dependable person Tyler was,"" she said. ""All he found out was that Tyler was gay.""

She called Ravi's actions toward her son ""arrogant and mean-spirited.""

Clementi's brother, James, told the court, ""I watched as Dharun slept through court as if it was not worth"" paying attention. ""I watched Dharun and his lawyers laugh as if it were a private joke.""

Earlier a lawyer for MB read a statement asking for prison time for Ravi because, he said, Ravi has not accepted responsibility for his actions.

""He must serve some type of confinement… To this day he appears to blame me for his conduct,"" citing Ravi's claim that he spied on his roommate because he feared MB would steal his iPad.

MB said he does not believe, however, that Ravi should be deported.

Watch Chris Cuomo's exclusive interview with Dharun Ravi on the full episode of ""20/20""

In recent days, several prominent gay activists have made public pleas for Ravi to not be sent to prison.

The judge began the proceedings today by noting the court had received a box full of petitions seeking a pardon for Ravi.

Some of the petitions were addressed to President Obama, but the judge said the president has no ability to pardon someone for a state crime.

Some of the petitions were addressed to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who would have the authority to pardon someone for a state crime.",abcnews.com,True

A lesbian couple who claimed they were victims of a hate crime have been arrested after police determined they staged the incidents.

On Oct. 28, Aimee Whitchurch, 37, and Christel Conklin, 29, called police and reported the words ""Kill the Gay"" were scrawled in red spray paint on the garage door of their Parker, Colo., home.

The next day, the couple told deputies they found a noose hanging on the handle of their front door.

The women told officers they believed the incidents were retaliation from their neighbors and homeowner's association, who had complained the couple did not pick up after their dogs.

Due to the nature of the crimes, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office worked in tandem with the FBI to investigate. After reviewing witness statements, authorities determined Whitchurch and Conklin had staged the incidents.

Both women are charged with criminal mischief and false reporting. Whitchurch faces an additional charge of forgery.

She told ABC's Denver affiliate KMGH-TV police were mistaken and vowed to fight the charges.

""This is a fight I started. This is a fight I'm going to finish. This is a fight I'm right on,"" she said. ""I have every right to live where I want to live.""",abcnews.com,True
