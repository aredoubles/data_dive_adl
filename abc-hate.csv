http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/sex-video-korea-accused-targeting-gay-soldiers-46930195,"A watchdog group says South Korea's army is hunting down and prosecuting gay servicemen after a video of two male soldiers having sex was posted on the internet earlier this year, stoking fear in an already persecuted minority group.

Military investigators looking into the case have threatened soldiers to out their gay peers, confiscated cellphones to check communication records, and even used dating apps to dupe soldiers into revealing their sexual identity, said Lim Tae-hoon, the head of the Military Human Rights Center for Korea, which tracks down abuses in the armed forces.

South Korea's army says it's conducting a proper criminal investigation into soldiers allegedly involved with filming and uploading the video, which is a violation of the country's communications laws and a military penal code that makes homosexual activity punishable by up to two years in prison. The army has denied allegations that investigators are using the case to embark on a broader mission to weed out gay soldiers.

""Military investigators used the information they gained from the investigation on the sex video to track down other gay soldiers in the army, starting by forcing the suspects to identify who they had sex with and then widening their search from there,"" said Lim, who said a soldier tipped his group off about the alleged crackdown.

In conservative South Korea, gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people are harshly stigmatized and struggle to be politically visible, while a powerful Christian lobby immobilizes politicians seeking to pass anti-discrimination laws. That stigma is amplified in the military, where most able-bodied South Korean men are required to serve about two years as the country maintains a large force in the face of potential conflict with North Korea.

Gay men are not exempt from conscription but are banned from engaging in homosexual activity while serving, leading to an environment in which they serve without revealing their sexual identity for fear of discrimination and reprisals.

""South Korea's military doesn't exclude gay men from compulsory duty, but once they enter the military, they are seen as dangerous and treated as potential criminals, as the ongoing army investigation shows,"" said Han Ga-ram, an openly gay human rights lawyer.

He said the investigation had ""touched off fear in the LGBT community.""

""Hate crimes against LGBT people are already a serious problem, and the government could make it worse by sending the wrong message by punishing gay men in the military,"" Han said.

The army doesn't reveal information about how often it pursues cases against gay soldiers, but Lim said in the five years before 2017 he knows of only two cases where soldiers were prosecuted for homosexual activity. Since the start of the year, more than 30 soldiers have come under investigation and one has been arrested, an army captain who did not know the soldiers involved, Lim said.

""The soldiers who are being investigated had sex with their partners under mutual consent and not inside the barracks,"" Lim said. ""The army has infringed on the realms of privacy and is falsely claiming that these soldiers committed wrongdoings.""

Lim said the arrested captain had never met the soldier who uploaded the video and he was arrested for allegedly obstructing the investigation by delaying his appearance for questioning due to his lawyer's schedule. The captain's lawyer could not be reached for comment.

Lim's group in 2014 uncovered the bullying death of a 21-year-old army conscript, a case that shocked the nation and led to calls for the Defense Ministry to take serious steps to reduce bullying and hazing in the military.

The army didn't provide details of its investigation into the video, including the number of soldiers being investigated or why the captain was arrested. It said in a statement that the investigation was proceeding legally and that the privacy of soldiers was being protected.

The army also stressed that homosexual activity in the military is banned to allow soldiers to maintain ""sound and healthy private lives.""

""The army will continue to deal with activities that disrupt the discipline of troops based on related laws,"" the army said in a statement.

South Korea's stance runs counter to that of the United States, which maintains bases in the country and is its largest ally. In 2011, the U.S. repealed its policy, known as don't ask, don't tell, which banned open homosexuality in the military.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/suspect-fresno-shooting-rampage-charged-previous-murder-motel/story?id=46925155,"The suspect behind a shooting rampage that killed three people in just minutes in Fresno, California Tuesday has been charged with murder from a previous killing.

The Fresno County District Attorney's Office charged Kori Ali Muhammad in last week's murder of 25-year-old Carl Williams, a security guard at a local Motel 6. Muhammad told investigators that he shot Williams because he disrespected him, Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said Wednesday. He is also charged with attempted murder for shooting at a second security guard.

Muhammad -- born Kori McDonald -- will be arraigned Friday morning on that murder charge. The district attorney has not yet submitted its case on the this week's shooting spree.

Police said Muhammad was inspired to carry out the ""hate crime"" shooting after learning on a local news report that he was the suspect of the Motel 6 murder.

Muhammad told police that he is Muslim but had't been to a mosque in 20 years and prays to numerous gods and practices voodoo rituals.

On Tuesday morning, he had gone to buy items to practice voodoo but stopped at a Starbucks instead, where he used the wi-fi to watch a news broadcast from ABC Fresno station KFSN, which identified him as the suspect in Williams' murder.

He then decided to kill as many white males as possible, Dyer said, adding that he Muhammad told investigators that he does not like white men. Muhammad has also written anti-government sentiments on social media as well as posts saying that he does not like white people, the police chief said.

John Walker/Fresno Bee via AP

Muhammad fired 17 shots in about three minutes, killing three people. He also fired at two women inside of a car and at a group of men at a bus stop.

Muhammad was arrested shortly after the shooting and has since given detectives several hours of interviews describing his actions, laughing while he made the descriptions, Dyer said.

Dyer said that officers witnessed Muhammad yell ""Allahu akbar"" at the scene of the shooting. Dyer described Muhammad as a ""racist"" rather than a terrorist.

The shooting was labeled by police as a hate crime. It is unclear if Muhammad has retained an attorney.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/church-pastor-killed-blasts-political-ad-46922111,"The pastor of a South Carolina church where nine black members were killed in a racist attack said Thursday that a political ad calling politicians weak and panicked for taking down the Confederate flag after the massacre was distasteful.

""The events of a racist committing murder is something that never should be utilized to advance someone's political career,"" Emanuel AME Pastor Eric Manning said.

Sheri Few, a Republican running for an open U.S. house seat in the northern part of South Carolina, released the ad on the internet Wednesday. In it, she stands in front of an American flag with a semi-automatic assault weapon.

""Weak politicians are too quick to blame a horrible tragedy on a flag, or a gun or even free speech. And that's how bad laws are made,"" Few said in the ad.

Manning said Few needs to remove the ad immediately.

""We lived the events of June 17, 2015, and now someone wants to utilize our pain for their political gain. There's just no call for that. I think it is distasteful, to be very candid and direct,"" Manning said.

Few is one of seven candidates running for the GOP nomination to replace Republican Mick Mulvaney, who left the U.S. House earlier this year to become director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Few said the ad will start running this weekend on cable channels in the district centered south of Charlotte, North Carolina.

Dylann Roof entered Emanuel AME and sat through Wednesday night Bible study for 45 minutes before opening fire during the closing prayer. He has been sentenced to death by a jury who found him guilty of federal hate crimes.

Few pointed out she never mentions the church specifically in her ad.

""I am a Christian. I love those people,"" Few said. ""That's why I support the death penalty for that sick, deranged man. And I hope a liberal judge doesn't get in the way.""

5:45 p.m.

The man suspected of killing three white men in a racially motivated attack in Fresno says he joined a gang in Sacramento when he was 9 and got involved with the black liberation movement at 14.

Kori Muhammad talked about his upbringing in a video interview published in 2015 on the website of Community Media Access Collaborative, where he was part of a media training program.

He says he joined the Nation of Islam and in 1995, when he was 17, he attended the Million Man March in D.C. as a lieutenant.

He says Martin Luther King ""wanted to hug their hands, and get along with them, and lick their feet and they still killed him.""

———

5 p.m.

The man suspected of killing three white men in a racially motivated attack in Fresno has a criminal history with arrests starting when he was 13.

Kori Ali Muhammad's criminal history includes arrests for gun possession, theft and drug charges. Records show he was arrested at least twice as a teen for possessing a gun in school.

Court records show Muhammad also was arrested in Washington state in 2004 after acknowledging he shot a gun outside his apartment.

Prosecutors said he left the state and the case was later dismissed after they declined to extradite him from a federal prison.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons says Muhammad was incarcerated at a federal penitentiary from October 2006 to September 2011 after being convicted of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute.

4:40 p.m.

The roommate of one of the victims of a racially motivated rampage in Fresno says they were waiting for a bus home when the shooter opened fire.

Mark Greer said he and 58-year-old David Jackson stopped at the Catholic Charities building after running a bank errand because Greer needed to use the restroom.

The two were waiting for the bus when authorities say Kori Ali Muhammad, who is black, targeted the white men at random. Greer said he ran into the Catholic Charities building.

Greer says they would shop for groceries and cleaned the house together. On the first of every month, Greer said Jackson would treat him to a meal at Denny's restaurant where they both ordered the club sandwich.

Greer says Jackson was a military veteran.

2:15 p.m.

Authorities says a suspect in a shooting that left three white men dead in Fresno continued shooting one victim on the ground.

Police Chief Jerry Dyer said Wednesday that the carnage began as Kori Ali Muhammad killed a security guard at a motel Thursday. Police said Muhammad spent the weekend in a ravine, and after learning he was wanted by police, set out to kill Tuesday.

Dyer says Muhammad, who is black, noticed a white man in a utility truck and fired into it, killing Zackary Randalls. He also shot Mark Gassett on a sidewalk, then pumped two more rounds into him as he lay wounded.

Finally, Dyer said Muhammad fired in the direction of a bus stop where he spotted three white men. They scattered, and the gunman picked an ""older gentleman"" who appeared to be heavier, David Jackson, and shot him twice.

1:45 p.m.

Authorities say a man picked up the gun that a suspect used to kill three white men in a racially charged attack in Fresno and are urging him to turn himself in.

Police Chief Jerry Dyer also told reporters Wednesday that it's ""very rare"" for a homicide suspect to cooperate with investigators in recounting the killings. Dyer says he believes Kori Ali Muhammad, who is black, was ""proud"" of what he did.

Muhammad yelled ""Allahu akbar,"" or ""God is great,"" during his arrest and described himself as Muslim but says he practiced voodoo rituals and prays to seven different gods.

Dyer says Muhammad isn't a terrorist but is a racist and described the slayings as a hate crime.

———

1:35 p.m.

Authorities say the man suspected of killing three white men in a racially charged attack in Fresno laughed multiple times as he recounted the rampage to detectives.

Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer told reporters Wednesday that Kori Ali Muhammad spoke about the killings in a callous way as he went with officers to the Motel 6 where he is accused of killing a security guard, and back to the scene of Tuesday's three killings.

Dyer says Muhammad told police that he gave himself up because he respects Fresno officers, didn't want them to shoot him and is not a ""coward.""

The police chief says Muhammad hasn't shown any remorse other than saying sorry to Dyer during his arrest.

———

1:30 p.m.

Authorities say the man suspected of killing three white men in a racially charged attack in Fresno told police he was ""not going to go down for shooting a security guard.""

Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said Wednesday that after Kori Ali Muhammad knew he was wanted for the security guard's death, he wanted to take out as many white men as possible. He told investigators that he did not like white men and that ""white people were responsible for keeping the black people down.""

He told investigators that he hid out in a ravine and practiced voodoo rituals after the Motel 6 slayings. He also told investigators he is Muslim, but he prays to seven different gods and hasn't been to a mosque in 25 years.

1:20 p.m.

Authorities say the man suspected of killing three white men in a racially charged attack in Fresno says he killed a motel security guard days earlier because the guard disrespected him.

Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer says suspect Kori Ali Muhammad spent hours talking with investigators after his arrest.

Dyer says Muhammad went with officers to the Motel 6, where he is accused of killing unarmed security guard Carl Williams. Muhammad had gone there to meet a woman, and he argued with security who asked him to leave.

Dyer says Muhammad fired at Williams, intending to kill him, because he felt Williams disrespected him.

The suspect then fled and hid on a gas station roof. Dyer says he watched detectives investigate, then left and hid by a dumpster.

12:25 p.m.

The mother of a man killed at a Fresno motel days before the same suspect was accused of a shooting rampage says she's grateful she told her son she loved him before he died.

Authorities say Carl Williams was working as a security guard at a Motel 6 on Thursday night when Kori Ali Muhammad shot and killed him after an altercation. Police say Williams was unarmed.

Francine Williams described her 25-year-old son as a kind and giving person who had recently gotten engaged.

She saw her son a few days before he died and spontaneously told him she loved him and was proud of him. Carl Williams told her he loved her, too.

Muhammad, who's black, was arrested Tuesday after police say he killed three other white men at random.

A close friend of a man who was shot in the passenger seat of a utility truck during a deadly rampage in Fresno says the victim was a 34-year-old father of two young children.

Eddie Valencia said Wednesday that he and Zackary Randalls were friends for 15 years after bonding on a job over a love of music and the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Randalls was in a training program for Pacific Gas & Electric and doing a ride-along Tuesday when he was gunned down. The driver wasn't hit and sped toward the police department, but Randalls died.

Two others also were shot and killed. Police arrested Kori Ali Muhammad, who is black, saying he singled out white victims and killed them at random.

Valencia called Randalls ""one of the wittiest people he's ever known,"" saying the two loved to laugh.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/US/fresno-police-chief-releases-details-hate-crime-shooting/story?id=46884877,"Police in Fresno, California revealed new details today on the ""hate crime"" shooting that killed three people in just minutes on Tuesday morning and what allegedly inspired the suspect to commit the murders.

Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said in a press conference Wednesday that suspect Kori Ali Muhammad -- born Kori McDonald -- was inspired to carry out the attack after learning on local news that he was the suspect of another murder at a local motel.

That's when Muhammad -- armed with a revolver -- decided that he was going to kill as many white males as possible, Dyer said, adding that the Muhammad told investigators that he did not like white men. Muhammad has also written anti-government sentiments on social media as well as posts saying that he does not like white people, the police chief said Tuesday.

Around 10:45 a.m. Tuesday, Muhammad fired 17 shots in about three minutes, Dyer said.

During the shooting rampage, Muhammad fired several times at two Hispanic women in a car, but he stopped shooting once he realized they were Hispanic and let them go, Dyer said. Muhammad also fired at a group of men at a bus stop and chased after one man, who was the heaviest and oldest of the group. That man became his final victim, Dyer said.

Muhammad was arrested shortly after the shooting and has since given detectives several hours of interviews describing his actions, Dyer said. The suspect lead detectives through the murder scenes and explained to investigators what he did and why, laughing while he made the descriptions, Dyer said.

Fresno Police via AP

Muhammad was already wanted for allegedly murdering a Motel 6 security guard who was identified by Dyer today as 25-year-old Carl Williams. The murder occurred last week, Dyer said.

Muhammad fired at Williams because he said the security guard disrespected him, Dyer said.

Muhammad led investigators through the crime scene at the motel as well as the locations from yesterday's shootings, Dyer said.

Muhammad told detectives that he is Muslim but hadn't been to mosque in 20 years and prays to numerous gods, Dyer said. The suspect also said that he had been practicing voodoo rituals and is not a terrorist or affiliated with any terror groups.

Dyer said that officers witnessed Muhammad yell ""Allahu akbar"" at the scene of the shooting. Dyer described Muhammad as a ""racist"" rather than a terrorist.

On Tuesday morning, Muhammad had gone to buy items to practice voodoo rituals when he went to Starbucks instead, Dyer said. While there, he used Stabucks' Wi-Fi to watch a broadcast from ABC Fresno station KFSN, which identified him as a suspect in Williams' murder.

Police were alerted to the scene Tuesday through ShotSpotter, a gunfire locator that detected multiple gunshots in the same vicinity, Dyer said Tuesday. Dyer played audio of the shots fired recorded by ShotSpotter during today's press conference.

Fresno Bee via AP Photo

Muhammad did not run from Fresno police officers because he said he respected them, according to the police chief. Muhammad said he didn't want police to be forced to shoot him and that he is not a coward.

Once he saw the officers on the scene, Muhammad got on the ground, Dyer said Tuesday.

Dyer identified the victims of yesterday's shooting, which included 37-year-old Mark Gassett, 58-year-old David Jackson and 34-year-old Pacific Gas and Electric Company worker Zachary Randalls. Dyer showed pictures of Randalls' family photos with his children after identifying him.

Randalls was driven to police in a PG&E truck, Dyer said Tuesday.

It is unclear if McDonald has entered a plea or retained an attorney.

The gun has not been located after it was wrapped in clothing and picked up by someone on the scene, Dyer said, describing the man who took it as Hispanic.

Dyer asked for the man who took the gun to turn himself in immediately. The man fled from the scene after taking the gun, the police chief said.

Muhammad spoke to his mother Tuesday night after he was arrested, Dyer said.

During the rampage, Muhammad shot at a resident who he encountered in the neighborhood multiple times but missed, Dyer said Tuesday. He then shot and killed the man he encountered next.

Muhammad dropped shell casings and reloaded his gun before setting of to Catholic Charities on North Fulton Street in Fresno, where he shot and killed a man he encountered in the parking lot, Dyer said Tuesday.

Aaron Van Curen, who lives near Catholic Charities, said he didn't believe what he was witnessing when he heard multiple gunshots. Gassett was killed near his home, Van Curen said. Once he saw that the shooter had left the scene, he went outside to feel for a pulse, and ""there wasn't one,"" he said.

""He was obviously dead at that point..."" Van Curen said, adding that he then waited for police to arrive.

Dyer said Tuesday night that he did not believe the murders were related to terrorism and that the shootings were ""solely based on race.""",abcnews.com,True

The suspect recording on his phone as he shot and killed an elderly man right on the street. The case is raising all sorts of questions about crime in the era of social media. Looks like there's one guy down in the white car. Reporter: The two-day nationwide manhunt for 37-year-old murder suspect Steve Stevens is finally over after he took his own life late this money. This started with one tragedy and ended with another person taking their own life. Loss of life is loss of life. We would like to have brought Steven peacefully and really talked to him to find out exactly why this happened. I'm at the point where I snapped. Reporter: Stevens on the run after posting this chilling video to his Facebook page on Easter Sunday. Find me somebody I'm going to kill, kill this guy right here, old dude. Reporter: He recorded himself randomly killing 74-year-old Robert Godwin senior in cold blood on a sidewalk in Cleveland. How old are you? Oh, man -- look -- Reporter: 911 calls from a neighbor witness described the chaotic aftermath. Where was he shot at? He's been shot in the head. Is he awake at all? No, I don't -- he's unconscious, he's dead. Reporter: Police made phone contact with Stevens Sunday but weren't able to convince him to turn himself in. Stevens' trail went cold shortly thereafter, leaving much of the country on edge. This individual is armed and dangerous and at this point heck be a lot of places. Cases like this where there's a national search and leads have dried up, the public is part of solving the crime. Reporter: The key to finding Stevens today, a call to 911 from drive-through employees at a McDonald's in Erie, Pennsylvania, where Stevens' cell phone had pinged a tower on Sunday. Came through drive-through, placed an order, got to the first window where he paid. The drive-through employee that was working at the time recognized him or thought -- noticed that the car was Ohio tags and it was a white fusion. And took his money and he pulled to the next window. Meanwhile she stepped out of there and called the state police right away. Reporter: Employees then asked Stevens to wait for his fries, which they deliberately held back in order to give law enforcement time to arrive. He didn't want to wait for the fries which was fine. But he took his six-piece, didn't want any money back, and headed out onto Buffalo road. The minute he turned right on Buffalo road, the state police right behind him at that point. Losing him wasn't an option at this point, there was too much at stake. Reporter: A short pursuit followed with Pennsylvania state troopers bringing Stevens' car to a stop. At that time Stevens used a handgun to take his own life. Reporter: For the family of the victim, a grandfather of 14, Stevens' death offers little comfort. It still ain't making me feel no better because he took himself out like a coward. No closure for me and my babies. Reporter: This senseless killing raises real questions about the role and responsibility of social media in potentially glorifying acts of violence. This is something that should not have been shared around the world. Period. Reporter: Stevens' graphic video remained on his Facebook page for more than two hours, viewed by more than 1,000 people, before his account was disabled. Today the CEO of Facebook, mark Zuckerberg, acknowledged his company needs to do better. Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Robert Godwin senior. We will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening. Reporter: Stevens' murder video was part of a series of rants he posted on his Facebook page Sunday morning. I deal with problems every day but when it comes to my Nobody gives a . Reporter: He came he was on a killing spree. I killed 13, working on 14 as we speak. I'm running around hating , man. I just snapped, man. Reporter: Stevens is not the first to post himself committing a violent crime on social media. Earlier this year, aacebook live video in Chicago captured the beating of an 18-year-old with special needs for nearly 30 minutes. In that case, Facebook removed the video and the four suspects were charged with committing a hate crime, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, and aggravated battery. We got a busted taillight in the back -- Reporter: Last summer a Facebook live video of philando Castille dying after being shot by a police officer while disturbing, also cast a powerful spotlight on police traffic stops and racial justice. He just shot his arm off. Reporter: Ska steel's girlfriend, diamond Reynolds, kept streaming, providing possible evidence in upcoming trial of the officer who pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter. He's licensed to carry. He was trying to get out his I.D. And his wallet out of his pocket. I chose to allow the video to go live ten seconds before my phone died, because I wanted everybody in the world to see what the police do and how they roll and it's not right. Reporter: In response to the Steve Stevens video Facebook said they are reviewing their reporting flows to be sure people can report videos and other material that violates our standards as easily and quickly as possible. And that they're constantly exploring ways that new technologies can make them sure that Facebook is a safe environment, including artificial intelligence. A couple of minutes on the internet now of a video can go viral, because it can be copied and shared widely in a number of different places. So these companies have a real reason to want to make sure it's not there in the first place. Reporter: Brian Godwin, grandson of Steve Stevens' victim, pleaded with people on Twitter to stop spreading the horrific video saying, please, please, please stop retweeting that individvideo and report anyone who has posted it, that is my grandfather, show some respect. That plea a reminder just as law enforcement relied on the public to report any information about Stevens' whereabouts, so too do social media companies rely on users to spot trouble online. We rely on the public to report and to participate in ensuring that our communities are safe. So we want to encourage people who are interacting on Facebook to report inappropriate conduct. Reporter: Tonight, law enforcement continues its investigation into Steve Stevens, who worked at a facility that helps troubled youth. The person that I knew 15 years ago, I could not imagine killing someone for any other reason other than like in self-defense or something like that. Reporter: He had documented happier times on his YouTube account over the past year and a half, including bowling, fishing, the championship victory of his hometown Cleveland cavaliers. We did it, baby, number one! A Normal, average guy. Graduated from school. Had stable employment. This is a surprise. Reporter: So far, the claims Stevens made about killing several other people have not been verified by law enforcement. Meanwhile, Robert Godwin's friends and family are paying tribute to him, telling my colleague ABC's Alex Perez -- It's my dad's invoice. Reporter: That they are heartbroken over their loss. He'd give you the shirt off his back. Just to know that I will never, ever hear my father's voice again. Devastating. You can't get any wronger than taking somebody's life. But my dad would be the kind of person that would say, you've got to forgive. You've got to forgive. Next here on a different

Officers witnessed him yell ""Allah Akbar,"" Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said Tuesday afternoon, adding that he has written anti-government sentiments on social media as well as posts saying that he does not like white people. The murdered victims were white males.

Later in the day, at a press conference Tuesday night, Dyer said he did not believe the murders were related to terrorism, adding that the shootings were ""solely based on race,"" deeming it a hate crime.

Around 10:45 a.m. local time, police officers with the Fresno Police Department responded to a scene after two gunshots were detected through ShotSpotter, a gunfire locator, according to Dyer. Several more gunshots were detected nearby, Dyer said.

A total of 16 rounds were fired in less than a minute in four different locations, Dyer said.

One of the shooting victims was driven to police in a Pacific Gas and Electric Company truck, Dyer said. That shooting was ""unprovoked,"" Dyer said.

The suspect then encountered a resident in the neighborhood, who he shot at multiple times but missed, Dyer said. After that, he encountered another man, who he shot and killed, Dyer said.

The suspect, who was armed with a revolver, then dropped shell casings and reloaded his gun before he set off to Catholic Charities on North Fulton Street in Fresno, Dyer said. There, he encountered a man in the parking lot and killed him, Dyer said.

Officers responding to the scene saw a black man running, who got on the ground once he saw the officers, Dyer said.

Police identified the suspect as Kori Ali Muhammad -- born Kori McDonald -- who was already wanted for an alleged murder of a security guard at Motel 6 on Thursday.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/target-online-trolls-suing-neo-nazi-websites-publisher-46863222,"A Montana real estate agent sued the founder of a neo-Nazi website on Tuesday, saying the publisher orchestrated an anti-Semitic ""campaign of terror"" that bombarded the woman and her family with hateful messages from anonymous internet trolls.

The barrage of emails, phone calls, texts and social media comments threatened and harassed Tanya Gersh and her family — including her 12-year-old son — with messages replete with slurs and Holocaust references, according to the federal lawsuit.

The trolling campaign started in December after Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin published the family's personal information, including the 12-year-old's Twitter handle and photo. In a string of posts, Anglin accused Gersh and other Jewish residents of Whitefish, Montana, of engaging in an ""extortion racket"" against the mother of white nationalist Richard Spencer.

Gersh's lawsuit said she agreed to help Spencer's mother sell commercial property she owns in Whitefish amid talk of a protest outside the building. Sherry Spencer, however, later accused Gersh of threatening and harassing her into agreeing to sell the property.

Gersh, 44, told The Associated Press that she has been so scared for her family's safety that she packed a bag and left it on her bedroom floor for three months in case they decided to flee their home.

""I've never experienced that kind of fear in my life,"" she said.

Gersh is represented by the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. Her suit accuses Anglin of invading her privacy, intentionally inflicting ""emotional distress"" and violating a Montana anti-intimidation law.

The mother of two young sons said she suffers panic attacks, goes to bed in tears and wakes up crying. She also said her real estate business suffered because she had to take down her website and is too afraid to answer the phone.

Her suit, filed in Missoula, Montana, seeks unspecified damages against Anglin, who didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Law center president Richard Cohen, one of Gersh's attorneys, said the case could be a blueprint for fighting a digital strain of white supremacy.

""In the old days, they would have burned a cross on Tanya's front lawn. Now, in the digital age, they launch a troll storm,"" Cohen said.

The Alabama-based law center filed a similar suit in 1998 against a white supremacist who threatened Bonnie Jouhari, a fair housing specialist in Pennsylvania. Jouhari fled with her daughter and moved to another state after her tormenter posted her address and photo on the internet and branded her a ""race traitor"" for her work.

But cases like these are very rare because many victims are too scared to sue or can't afford a lawyer, said Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor and author of the book ""Hate Crimes in Cyberspace.""

""We don't have a lot of precedent with provocateurs like Andrew Anglin,"" Citron said.

Anglin uses a mailing address in Worthington, Ohio, for his website, which takes its name from Der St?rmer, a newspaper that published Nazi propaganda. The site includes sections called ""Jewish Problem"" and ""Race War.""

The Daily Stormer's trolling targets have included prominent journalists, a Jewish congressional candidate in California, a British Parliament member and Alex Jones, a radio host and conspiracy theorist whom Anglin derided as a ""Zionist Millionaire.""

Anglin's Dec. 16 article about Gersh urged readers to ""take action"" against her and other Jewish residents of Whitefish, posting their telephone numbers, email addresses and Twitter handles.

""And hey - if you're in the area, maybe you should stop by and tell her in person what you think of her actions,"" he added.

Richard Spencer has popularized the term ""alt-right"" to describe a fringe movement loosely mixing racism, anti-Semitism, white nationalism and anti-immigration. Spencer and Anglin have appeared on a podcast together and are both leading figures in the alt-right movement.

After Donald Trump's election, Spencer hosted a conference in Washington that ended with audience members mimicking Nazi salutes after Spencer shouted, ""Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!""

According to the lawsuit, Whitefish residents' ""discontent with the Spencer family had been simmering for years and reached a fever pitch when the 'Hail Trump' video of Richard Spencer went viral.""

Gersh fears her lawsuit will stir up another round of threats, but she said she is suing because the campaign against her family went ""far beyond harassment."" She and her husband, Judah, felt compelled to teach their sons about the Holocaust after the trolling started.

""Our dinner conversations at home now regularly include that they shouldn't be in fear for being Jewish,"" she said.",abcnews.com,True

Hey what's up everybody welcome to uncut after all. The goal here is to have honest unflinching conversations about the issues that seem to divide us as Americans. I am from the united each week in the feature one on one interview with special guest to learn more not only about what they believe but why they believe when they do. With me today. Ari carnival. And congress can they weren't very embarrassing Reza Maine yes do it. Queens there is Brooklyn aids and median those of multiple podcasts including politically active my you have been seen on any number of late night comedy shows. Letterman Conan and Jimmy Kimmel you had your special on Comedy Central it. People basically come into contact with viewing at work any number of accurate. Yeah and that's embarrassing announcement that feels really good. And it's your. I want to talk TO. Because a lot of your work focuses on rates not all of it. But a lot and you especially over the last year for when the first people who really started to talk about it. In a political context. We seem to resonate with a lot of people wanted to understand more about. You again you grew up. And how that came I think they wanted to talk about it let's tell me about. Are pretty go out. Well for well I think it's funny fizzled district eleven talking about the stuff forever in them and now all the sudden it it. To allow more people it's become relevant bits and I'm just counseled on the same stuff or it owns the same. Ideas and now I think it's there's just so much so many more ideas that people are exposed to weather through the Internet or or because you know if you the president. That says summing ants Islam phobic or sexist all the sudden it's easier to give an example because the president of the United States that it puts them. It's a good it's an integrated newspaper. And he's a human on palate I. This happen island an of the story yet how this happened in honor the story of heart. I grew up in Queens New York my father. As a go cart event technician. And Flushing Hospital my mother runs past lab at long island Jewish hospital she was a doctored India and fortunately she can be doctors here it is raising two kids. From. And they emigrated here when they were adults and yes my father first and my mother asked there both my brother and I am a rather show. Would later be the height man the rap group das racist views later. We grew up in that in Queens first and Jackson Heights and Floral Park near the border of long albums make sure it's clear it's. It's as alignments there is a very clear line there. And and in and in Jamaica queens. Went to Townsend Harris high school is where the high school mascot named after main pollutants that if they get three strangest year after year Harry the hawk HA yes that's OK my senior year. High school sophomore had. Raise money to make a mascot can you whatever he wanted and shows me because I did comedy I was really active public school but it wasn't. John assault went toward schools with some really lay. There are other options clearly happy and salt the Hulk is is closer it's coding. And a necklace but they went with Larry a ha how you about. It's real ethical legacy but it it. It feels like Iceland and lived up some and that happened in high schools including immediately as I've done I've had a nice career but I still haven't. John assault again that's that's a hell of a standard. That is what's driving this thing is that just kind of math that yeah definitely have to your career on the line right here credit that. So were you always this way we did you only about things the way that you think about the now as a kid to. No I mean I think a sense of justice and fairness and sensitivity and like that was always there and I think eyewitness with at this from the way your folks raised my mom and am I am I think I'm. Mom and dad very a very different people I think a lot of those characteristics come from my mom and so is. Sensitive buffalo chips quick and especially you know I think. Being. You know she was that she was a doctor and India and her small town in utter. You know in her twenties in future accomplished a great deal and also she lost everything came to this country has to be a housewife which was not the plan and I think when you deal with lots of things a lot of loss losing family and your over here all the stuff. You know I think sense of humor becomes so crucial and I saw how my mom was able. Often collapse awful lot of painful awful things that's yet to deal with. And I think that's a lot of a lot of votes in and I think seeing how my mom had to cope with. The frustrating things in her life and how she was able to finish is a very dark sense of humor. I think that instilled that in me and my brother in and my brother maverick clothes so at that we have this mother who kind of instill this kind of humor and my brother and I are discovering the world together very close I think you know that that obviously. You know leads to both of those looking for moments to make people laugh and I think New York also grant India Tanzania has a funny. What do you. I got queens is arguably the most diverse places in the country yes yes or yes I think the organs and nothing New York is tough it's hard to with the queen's that we it and you know. A fairly decent I'm it wasn't like the roughest areas but still it was like New York. Is crowded it is you know classrooms were crowded we with public school education. It forces you to be a little stronger rate things aren't catered to you and I think. You know as an adult like subways like they're that great equalizer regardless of their class if you're on a subway everyone the same way everyone feel the same thing that once smelled the same things that anyone. It's there's some it very clear current yes and if you you're forced to confront reality and I think you know as a result you have to cope and you cope with humor and I think nudism dark. A ducts at the humorous in New Yorkers. We're very quick I grew up late you know snapping back and forth friends like insulting each other that's normal rain late you know the idea I've met people after the fact who that Michael wise everything have to be elected Cho gruesome unlike. It that's what communicated so we all communicated to congress as the conversation might not the citizens substance of what we're saying but it's it's said through humor and so. I think all of that late you know plus being in Europe where it but it's the most famous comedy scene in the country like. I was exposed to comedy both click informally and formally my whole life. And I feel like asking this question this kind of living up to stereotypes kind of hate task at that he and it will be as Iowa's wonder I'm first generation American pure wonder. How much of that is a shared experience yet it was there pressure. To kind of live out dreams not for your parents to sort of like do battered do more. My hand and certainly but my parents were never. And you have to do this yet but they were always. Progress in the sensibly worried about. You know lake. Us feel that wants to be happy would Everett was happy healthy and of course a mentally comedy was something newer. There's it was a phase the long as it was a phase them as certain practical enough to know that's. I mean now oh. Let's head fifth at that. Much more financially lucrative insecure if this is a phase but when you told them this was the chosen path what did they say I mean at that point was already late I got a master's degree of foreign made this the chosen paths that's finally I jumped into her before college today and I was doing in the high school and college. It was obvious they had idea moved to Seattle to be human rights organizes a keep that in mind went from wine to be a lawyer to be human rights ordinance to a comedians like kind of very. With subtlety. An intention lowered the bar so by the time we got to comedian they were already on board of this is not to be what we want. And to settle for some things he's doing some things. But I do ask you about at that obviously had to inform the way you approach a comedy out your experiences and rights organizer on the West Coast and also. The decision to go in a master's in human right yes right now. I mean you know I'm. I'm somebody who came of age. After 9/11 again wrecked. I remember pre 9/11 and remember what that life was like and I remember how things change pretty immediately after. So from might yet happen I was eighteen so from from my adulthood it's post nine elevenths so. And I grew up in a really diverse place where I grew up in a place that rest of the country apparently fears Ursula been told rent. Something rarely has multiple languages and ideas and religions like you know the idea of being Muslim is and that's a scary for thing my best friends or muscle. In a group in mosques playing you know. And the Hindu I also have the the the weird. Like the thing. Lake there's a a rivalry that Islam but there's that you know that is hatred from years past of Hindus and Muslims and other countries that. You know get carried here that like. Me and my friends don't really think about is like in the air crane lake Villa like generations past legacy and so much more complex than what people have here you know play it SO the like eight grew up with that comes with already used complicated. Multi layered thing which I certainly didn't realize until I left in queen though at a college in Maine which was very different. And that. 1911 happens I'm already being more conscious about race because you home with every I was humane and as I was about in colleges Zoellick you know already in my life was different of them like I was hit with this is what rich means and visible wealthy mean about rich wealthy brain this is all the money. That it isn't a coincidence that your last name is the same name of that building that's like it was. The youth in summer as a verb like all the stuff that a I am I did not do I went to public schools mile live up to that point and already the class differences is there and then the race things you know. Of being seen as an outsider Bradman and when I went to public schools I was a brown kid going to. You know rich white kids school in Maine so. Already that was there but the 9/11 happens and you're getting hit with that already in all the sudden. The whole country the whole country you seen a little differently so what changed for you specifically where there instances that follow he. I mean reading about hate crimes on the country certainly was in which is embarrassing that it it it hit. This is happening to the black community is tennis and has been happening for ever rent but all the sudden as an eighteen year old hits me like. These are happening all over the country in the when they start happening in Queens. That's when it really hit. You know literally hit home because it felt like all of this is all that these or other places. These are diverse places these are not mine people in the Michael we grew up together. And and you know -- immediately as his presence been number up to do we know each other's kids at Amazon neighborhoods and it's happening here it'll say things to you. In Queens in sure is sure you know you before and after you know it's not like ignorance started post nine elevenths. But certainly was elevated you know after that and worked at you know local just attorney's office in the hate crimes BO so I saw what was happening in my view I was definitely informed. I mean all those things really shaped the way I saw the world you know and it forced me to ask more questions and you know the idea that the civil rights movement is a living thing it's not just a period. Of time it's something we're still fighting for are always fighting for justice these of things I didn't have instilled until after 9/11. And up to that point I was doing comedy bit my comedy to that point was just trying to make people laugh by any means necessary which meant like. Accents. You know what did I know from house south Asians are portrayed in the media again accents made people laugh. Ray we weren't full people we didn't need to be full people we just have to be Karadzic's. I didn't know any other way to deal brand I wasn't given that many role model eligible Marla really had. Was was Margaret Cho you know and Margaret had a lot of debt I'd I was a kin have depth yet. But I knew from deathly from watching the Simpsons at least that like if I used accents. I would make people laugh and that's comedy was. Q do you access now. My post silent and everything kind of change that regard it felt lake having a public. Stayed to such a privilege even at that level as as an 181920 year old with with a college audience. It was a privilege. And I knew that I had a voice and people will. Listen to and there was some level of influence there. So with all that experience and not just like experience a professional it and think you're seeing you clearly have like eight. Sort of moral awakening that Genesis this is something that needs to be addressed. Which is local something a lot of people young people I think are having now with the trump elections yes and I see that college campuses I see this. This people are alive in no way that I remember posts eleven there was a lot of us that woke up at the same time so why comedy why did you decide to channel all of that there why I mean I like comedy and Tyler comes and those 161516. Years old there wasn't a noble thing you know I loved comedy like it was. You know why you could start a band I wanna be a fight for freedom now because I like music I play in danced and I didn't know how to play an instrument my poetry set so elated at comedy. My love comedy union that was that was that at a comedy well before it became more aware of the bigger issues in the world his love the art form in crystal of the art from intact and so. You know as. Comedies wonderful and because that there's such as there's a direct connection to what you experience whether it's. The macro the Microsemi happen today can talk about it immediately at I've come. I thought about these big issues in my life I can talk about it immediately something so direct about it so as you will evolve as a human being. There there's. It is a very little there's a three small buffer there isn't isn't like I have to months and years to write this novel mind on stage I'm figuring it out with the audience. And talking about things that are happening now yet. News talk about always have current format from that point on I I realize that like. You know you can ignore what's there so I couldn't question because you you can you even do comedy as you mentioned that a lot of different way he's right. But you are very intentional there's almost an activism. A kind yet there. It it's not. I think early on I definitely saw the two things as the same thing you know I don't now. I certainly at the time you know was on state saying these are the things they need to cover the people need to know and I need to say them. And figure out a way to make them funny and we finally to make them funny though those under an as certain point you realize. You do yourself a disservice you do your audience a disservice and you do whatever you care but a disservice if you're not focused on the task at hand returned to something other than just making the task at hand isn't to inform the task it has to make people laugh if you wanna inform people I know all the ways to do that because I used to do that organizer right. This isn't that this is a comedy show you need to make people laugh and if if you do this to the best of your ability in that way that's almost as revolutionary. Like people are actually willing to listen to you there and and not only is that humanize you and relate to you. And I. You know it it's a work in progress. But that's so crucial so yeah I would say early on I was up there saying the things I believe what I Osce treated mice stages a soapbox of that point. And it took years to try to figure out what all the I knew how to write jokes even early on I was good with structure. I threw that way to talk with the things that cared about how to integrate the two how delay of its you know. Continue being great later develop as a writer while talking about things that are close to me let my here roasted. But prior Harland Margaret Cho Chris Rock Chappelle. They they're talking about big issues not because they have to but because that's in their hearts and that's in their mind that's what they think about. So much of your work to focuses on your experience on other communities of color showed a minority communities in America. And I'm I'm curious because like all comics he probably had to travel the country to a lot of different kinds of places in communities. Does years. Material lands differently in some audiences yen the idols a lyric. It's funny like in like if you're an all white room yet middle America DL the same joke the same way. Bomb. Well no because that's a thing it's that in general. That's being a bad comedian I think in general even if it's a different rooms and New York you have to see what's happening in in the room then you have to react to Bryant so. They have fight -- say a couple of adjustments clues some discomfort let me figure out the discomfort address let me find a way to get them on my side and and you know I'm gonna change my point of view yeah. But I wanna try to find a way it's so the so I do my job to find a way to make it work like. You know you've had teachers that stick to the lesson plan regardless of what's happening and they don't care and you know they don't care and and you know of the teachers. That like or in the moment and scientists say that they haven't rehearsed the same funny line like for six periods in a row wreck but they also know. How to get it to this particular group of kids that's what the but those of the best he does the teachers I remember. Rent the ones that found a way to reach me and it wasn't the same thing and they knew that every class but every kid wasn't the same. You know that every kid was different in every room was different and this is right after lunch they're gonna be. The rule will tire because that is state the first class of the day so they're exhausted because of date in the morning got to change he actually I don't you have to realize what's in the room consulates same thing is. In the same becomes when you travel the country. What just happened here what happened in Charleston I'm to engage in Charleston what leftists and Charleston yes. You know I'm I'm in North Carolina collections done obviously North Carolina went red but I'm men I'm in chapel hill's what does that mean right. AM in Chicago I'm talking about gun violence but in Chicago that means something tears specifically you have to realize what's there. But when you talk about race so much in the way that you do to let you make fun of white people sure it's I mean act and make anoint him on the senses that make from the white Tennessee and I mean yes quite identity go out easily anyway and absolutely. Absolutely because like. Bull won I grew up where you didn't see much of that. I don't know how it is now from little a little better but lake. You know from the people of color rumors the where were the jokes came from. We were the props right. We were talked about weeding it to write the scripts and we didn't get to speak for ourselves cancel what is it like when it's the other way around and it's very interesting when you have an audience. That's I'm very mixed to mostly people of color. For the white people on an audience to hear catharsis to laughter. You know articulate what's going on here you know this isn't just some people don't like it when we knew very adamant about that some people if you had like about experience is silent man in regularly people walked notes people Hackl. I've had people threaten me in the middle of a show. That people say racist things of the of the worst on Donaldson the ones who say racist things. Loud enough so I can hear and what Yukio. Well if that's the thing it's Lama frighten him put out loud enough for a real health community you have to make the call to light disrupt the show is when that happens you know you have to restate that things of that audience knows what's happening otherwise you Armenia yelling at somebody. You would have had to learn the hard way lake I'm so upset I'm reacting vs thinking about. No it's not about them it's about the show this person's going after me how to incorporate this or doesn't distract. At the end of the day. You know if if it's gonna hurt the whole show it's not about this this maniac who's this basis you know. You nor I might ignore book. And the thing is it that I ignore it publicly animals eating field amongst the taking it in have to deal with the fact that this. Person decided it was okay to say this to hurt me. It wasn't to be a jerk it was and to make a scene it was still hurt me don't know hearing from the units in the wrote in the front rows. Like for you know I mean why he had a lot of people and I actually read an accountant and an arm of the name of the gentleman someone Hispanic I couldn't go on and humane comedy anymore. Because the heckling was getting so that end zone nasty it wasn't like hey you staying. It was racial stuff that was sexist stuff that was it kind of stuff that you would you can you'd never think if someone to grant dates. Because I know that of the people I'm. Reaching an people who were laughing. It's more important to them. And that that I'm getting more often them on the positive end and that the negativity the few people are giving me and that they're notice activity in summer comes from feeder who. You know they don't understand this they don't like this the comes from fear. And that always been there has it gotten better or worse every hand is the Thomas has gotten better just because like you know there's more south Asians in the media business operations in comedy is more south Asians with. A broader range of characteristics being displayed you know we're not one dimensional and and so. When our onstage as a twenty to 23 year old in new York and Seattle. You know and that wasn't tuning accents people to know what to do with me pain Michael what is this and he's not being of the idea of addressing the elephant in the room like. Skin colors and on got an elephant in the room when they idea that I have to. Address that and every time the way the a lot of things are women selected as his address that fact that women first hand as opposed as a human being with a set of experiences like. But there's a little less of that somewhere else comes from success like you know it's not like a meal with unfamiliar with you're. I'm not like a wise this guy brown it's it's hurry. You know it makes things a lot easier when people know what they're coming to see obviously you know and it wasn't like that ten years of in the climate has changed like. You know Aziz and Mindy are groundbreaking figures just because it doesn't matter if they're saying groundbreaking things and I'm they exist and they have control and a certain degree of dignity. That we didn't have. For it is as you've gotten more successful we have more more people no you sure it you know. Do you feel any responsibility. To try. To. Make things better to change he used to you don't really formula to make people laugh but now you have a microphone anyway that a lot of other people. Didn't before UN may not. Is there any sense of like how can I need to try to make things. Of course what that is different ways to do that I don't think stand up is that the right. You know what I mean I think my stance proves to be effective it's used in college in classrooms high school that's on curriculums like I know that lake. Is to it wasn't the intention right now. But that's unify think about that wait for the work's not going to be is as good you know. How Randall pod cast the bright can be blunt clinically mentally and be blunt and also our podcast but I do with the peak mount bout then we have sections we explain concepts of peoples who were on the same page and it. Is that there's there's other ways for. You know from for me to get information people and and two. You know too too too aggressively deal with the things that are. And my heart and head in on don't think stand at this goes on but I do I do think everything there is a responsibility and I'm making a film right now. About up who from the Simpsons why fret about representation it's easier to TV and you know it's part of it is certainly is an identity aspect to rip apart it to me is also like. When you think of 9/11 and post 9/11 backlash used it's not just. As simple as people are ignorant they see the brown people on the attack them to get to that point you have to not humanize that person. And you can't humanize that person because you you haven't seen him be human. Look as. As people of color we've had to humanize lay people we've had no choice Reich puzzles are teachers and our neighbors we see them on television a broad range of life experiences right. That I'm watching a movie you know that's exactly my life experience but I can understand and a human level which is there something in the from grammar absolutely which is why it's frustrating when you hear people say no one's gonna believe that a personal colors playing this part notably an. That this kind of and an interracial marriage in this in this movie will work moments in a believe that the capital like that. To me it's like saying you don't think I can exist in this way you don't humanize me the way I've been forced to humanize you ride. So when 9/11 haven't amounting who denial of that are directly connected but there's something to be said about you are not a full person to me. I don't understand you as a full person. I don't notice seek is I don't know. You know what what your life could be like I can't imagine you with the family. I don't imagine any of those things. Is that ill links Dave two without Asian yes he or anything terrorist. Or terrorists in the red area there cartoon of that that is weak yen has no. Controls their lives ray or you're a terrorist earlier a cab driver who doesn't have a it's something wrong with being convenience store owner a cabdriver. But the UQ are in the servant class or not someone who's actually expressing range what does that have drivers experience. What is a convenience owners experience who whether Pham is how did they end up here that's never relevant to their props. Due process the election. Com. I mean I think it was. Driven by a again as you can't say racism is in the part of you can't because you know I'm not saying that. Half the country's racist but. There are certainly people who. Justified racist things are being says and looked past it because they want something else it dismissed. Dismiss either dismissed it or didn't like it but they couldn't vote for Hillary couldn't vote. For anybody other than Republican and still saw what you make a compromise at this person's racist and saying racist things and I don't like hearing the split. Chops the past believe jobs or you don't know how economics work really so. This man's as a business person vote like being a business person successful doesn't mean you know how to remic come. It's expected a year earlier point you're making if people if it offense large section of the country's only ever known bloom color in a certain contact and I don't live. In the environment your regularly bumping up against those other experiences and passion and humanize and being able to see them useful people this. Dude works in the kitchen and that's the job I could of had this person does construction that's just utterly but it. They could've humanize your there's no I mean you you have to announcing the person has competition of deceit president's part of the community and languages sometimes an issue but the what you do his stroller and each other's language and you try to find a way to connect Bethel community. Tension is let me talk about racism in the election in modern times I think people think prescribing that to the people who support it mr. trump. To say that there was there was an element of race undeniably but that they sort of dismissed it or in small thing that maybe even participated monitoring and whenever. What if it just wasn't even a factor because that doesn't matter in their communities they don't have people of color they're not we're not that used to that impeachment. What you ignore also so some things here. You know if you if you don't defeat it's a brace its. It's not like it doesn't exist there's something to be said about ignoring something allow something to happen you're aiding and abetting in racism even if you are not actively taking part in it. But if you're not UN and I and you haven't experienced. Yes I guess can we can you blame people for dismissing. If they've never experienced it if it's never been a part of there they've always been on the side of the equation where it didn't really affect. Ahmet if this was the 1920s. I might agree with you. But media has changed. Unity eat it they're gonna hear about racism they're winning you people stores and they might react. By saying. You know again with the race card playing it again there's still having did hear the story and decide whether they want to believe it. So yeah at a certain point. If you're given information time and time again those people are you and they choose to ignore they refuse to humanize other people. That's racism. That's racism B you can't say it will they've never had experience with that. I didn't have experience was latent white people from the midwest. But I still see them as human beings. Because I've seen their stories over and over and over again you know it to the point where I can watch field of dreams and I'm not gonna be like. Met people in the midwest they're nuts they just destroy their fields for. For for baseball fields and they believe in ghosts knowledge been absurd thing to say because I've seen more than one. White's story about the midwest you know. It's great of the top three sports als isn't that the baseball movie which is great which is also some bank in always connect with people on but his latest. Since miserably but. But pound with. Little League short Little League career but like. Of a you can't I mean I I refuse to believe that people aren't exposed to race in some form at this point we had a black president. You telling me people are really colorblind that nobody notices and if they didn't notice that they didn't hear about it and some press or some relative to children and it was just business as usual no lake. People aren't completely in their bubbles things reach them they have to make choices. And if they're unable to humanize other people in understand their stories at a certain point it's on them. This isn't 5060 years ago it's now things are very different you have access to stories and ideas to your it was believed. You're the last question. And sure it'd be to the people who felt my. This last presidency. Did not speak to their lives their wages went down ten segment of the population non college educated that they did see their wages decline shore over the last decade. If you felt like this system isn't working for me. This president didn't work for me. Throw it all out the window. This guy could be my one shot. You have to be willing to understand that the president. Definitely has impact but some of the stuff is systemic. It doesn't come until a magical person who takes over and fixes everything. Well we've laid clearly discovered is the person in touch can easily destroy everything or make decisions that put the country at risk. But if you wanna but the but it's harder do the other side and it's harder to. To rebuild things that's harder to create jobs it's harder to. Allocate funds elsewhere it's harder to. Bum deal with a congress that you know eight Obama had a congress that was. Was blue when he started. But but at the senate doesn't mean that everyone's on the same page rate these or not you have to understand how those things work. Because if you think that let bull bottles and off as a leading get these things and so it's his fault stylus works plus the fact that lake. You know people to know the difference between Obama care and the American to care Affordable Care Act so. What is that like if you if if you don't understand that stuff. You're not making an informed decision you're making it based on. On hearsay. And false news and what your uncle said that and at it and chain email and we what is the you know. And if you're not exposed. The black people and you just exposed to a few images and the president will easily doing things through the black people it's only cares little about race with them it's like. But he that'll happen if you really don't have a broad range of experience. How do you patty be funny. National and this presidency and is a lot of material America's environment that this heaviest stuff to Armenian so this could have theory. Real serious impacts on people's lives and RD time. This is you know in some ways this isn't new it's just more exposed now some of its new because it's like cheese lake I've never seen. In such a short period of time like. But you've seen the bones of the administration's it's like the hiding very much fumble laying Blake. The bitterness of present its treating from his personal account to you know had to delete tweets about the Oscars to somebody detect tweet of a youth and the announcement. Lake that's new. But he but the rest of it line you know of the racial anxiety you know he doesn't doll with sleet screams like. This is not you know this doesn't know and so there was that mean for your hour by means that like the stuff I was talking about before turning to convince people the first step isn't to say what he said. Loaded on a you know this of freezing established the progress that yet followed bishop president I think cut to the chase I mean look that's the unfortunate thing is that lake of the stuff a couple of this fairly evergreen racism unfortunately is evergreen as a sexism and homophobia there's been. Change in progress and mutations so it looks different but. He's ever been things I can I can talk about them because they're happening and it happens been so for me it doesn't change. All that much it just it forces me to kind of just. I have to address what's happening on top more than I normally do because normally I don't like talking about politics. That stood at sports to me. Some if you're into sports great if you knives and that separates view but. Now I think more people into sports and anemic it's hard when it's so accessible now because he says things that are so blatant the blunt you know. Come here to the point where you can give a speech but his his recent joint session yes. And this beacon stumble and fumble but it's seen as a good speech because the bar's been so different. He has been so low and to the point where he gives. I mean in the joint session in early stumble and fumble that he 88 did you read off prompter volatile days. Bristol stumbled and fumbled and made it a few words that he people who look openly that they together again yet I think we're so used to handling really are as though you're saying does a company speaking there were words he made there was that there are things that I got so used to into the Hamlet OK and we know that. And he'd he'd deftly moved as a Mfume known as a performer I'm like okay he deftly improvised a few words as he yes might have lost his. Place on the prompter any trying to fill in space that are moments moment of his sting eagle has driven and so prone to want to sort of. In provide embellishment here and there scrapped its so and that's not a part of the ever steady through in the catch phrase he makes money every on the hat sold lake. That's not normal and also link with peoples and to be ignore -- believed that he addressed the hate crimes stuff and its duties of that you have right off the top ready and he also in the Middle East slipped in the voice businessman he's sly and Mike the homeland security office for us people to report crimes committed against them that I immigrants rain. It's not a small thing. Yet and somehow it a secret police force the but he slipped that in the middle. So let's focus on the actions late words are words that doesn't mean any thing late one of the actions and so. Now I think we were were the bar is so low. That he can give us lip service about late hate crimes are bad well it. Yet wow yes they are bad throng with a of course a bad. And and he basically. You know tacitly. Is saying that violence against immigrants is good because we have a government agency. That's as went immigrants are hurting you specifically that the dome brand of violence he should reported. When your tacitly. You know. When you are pointing at a specific group sensing this specific group is trouble. Here tacitly giving permission to people to react to it just like with the war on terrorism during the bush era if you know if you since I he was instead fast enough. I think especially early with talk and how we're all Americans. Muslims are Americans. So a lot of hate crimes early on you when you Philip you know. Blinked but more than when he sailing getting people out of their caves in need to humanize Muslims off the bat it's hearts at. To get that back in the Bachmann ticket out and so that was enough. I'm charity gives outsize importance to use something that's not really a problem Bradley the actual crimes committed by an document they missed me. Non existent. So. Your albums toys for a teenager debut coming album rent waiting for money for you do yep sounds very threatening to suck and if it can't think that's the area that white majority is supposed to become technical minority which it's funny is that the album is about the fact that that's not important to pry the head. Fifth split you know I can't you can't really wait for 2042 but it's really none point ultimately we needed. Not entitle Mecca that and it won a ST on apple is on the first suspected in wanted to get that they two point. Mainstream American comic is related yeah. I want to ask you about the cover the very thick that they have viewed its provocative. Lieutenant. A UN of the truth he. Its it department that nurtured this but. The photos actually soda asked to be in a sexy Asian and callon their cool also oh lead my friend Katie we took a bunch of pictures from the counter. And easily cover for this album and in this is one of the outtakes. And so if it works so well already as it can you do your best describe it is telling you shorten your its Meehan a USA flag jacket on no undershirt. Provocatively and zipped lake chest hair all up in your face. Tom in in my. South Asian man goodness like it's that that you know it's the I'm very proud of that picks are you how you feel about it when you look at it I'm handsome man look handsome. An argument and the funny thing about it is there's some people who late because they think it's funny just funny. The some people who like because it's like Omega fully confident and also some people's votes really picture. I love the faculty of those things that list. And that I've gotten to do all those things that it was unintentional under the name of the album is going to be mainstream American comic and decided that but. But it is perfect and it looks like an American Apparel ad. It tough thing that and that's intentional. Again now it's that it's both albums really you know they're they're similar in that they talk about. Complete lake what is the place of a person of color and society. And talk about it and the deal I talk about racism and violence. And class and gender and sexuality in the idea of of marginalization and the fact that lake. Being marginalized identity like being a minority groups though makes you mainstream. You know because of that the story. Of the oppressed is the story of America. And so analysts say that was is not funny but late that's basically the theme you see that the route. Both records and the last one units called mainstream American comic. Also because I talk about you know politics for the first and only about. Republicans and Democrats all that much I did for this one so that wasn't an attempt Elton reaped what it can do this thing too which have done so you don't. Anything more do now but like it it's it to me and historically it's kinda like. I don't. I'd rather talk about Obama and the drones as opposed to getting legislation through and let rather talk about. How the legislation is being described what people know roses like.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/man-threatened-jews-metal-music-site-faces-sentencing-46829339,"A Connecticut man who posted threats against Jews and synagogues on a metal music internet forum plans to argue at his sentencing that he has served enough time in prison.

Kendall Sullivan is scheduled to go before a U.S. District judge in Bridgeport on Monday. He pleaded guilty in January to perpetrating a hoax and originally faced three federal charges of making online threats.

The 50-year-old was arrested in July following an investigation that linked him to messages posted that spring and summer on the Metalthrone.net website.

""I will slaughter them and burn their Synagogue to the ground . . . kids, goldfish, old folks. Shove money down their throats,"" Sullivan wrote under the screen name KS43. ""These Jews of 2016. They think they are safe.""

Investigators searched Sullivan's Stamford home and found more than two dozen firearms, gun parts, high-capacity magazines and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

Patricia Ferrick, the agent in charge of the FBI's New Haven division, said at the time that authorities ""may have averted a horrific hate crime from occurring.""

Sullivan is in state prison serving four consecutive 90-day sentences after pleading guilty to weapons charges. Prosecutors plan to argue he also should serve at least a year in federal prison on the hoax charge.

But Sullivan and his attorneys say he's been punished enough. They contend his posts were not meant to be taken seriously and were part of a heavy metal music culture rooted in themes that ""society deems off limits, including the occult, war, death and destruction.""

""Mr. Sullivan has found mostly disappointment and punishing loneliness in this life,"" they wrote. ""It is no small mystery that he turned to the internet to express his frustrations among other dejected, frustrated white men from suburbia. He spouted off nonsense for shock value among others who took pleasure being shocked.""",abcnews.com,True

As Roof's grandfather Joe Roof, a longtime real estate lawyer in Columbia, South Carolina, addressed the court for the first time today, he said, ""Dylann is not all bad.""

His grandson, who is white, has already been convicted of hate crimes in a federal case and has been sentenced to death for the murders of nine black parishioners at the Emanuel AME Church in June 2015.

""We’re sorry,"" Joe Roof said, adding, ""We have been distressed and just sick over what has happened to these families.""

""My wife and I have them in our prayers every night, every meal,"" Joe Roof said.

""What happened here I will never understand,"" he added. ""I will go to my grave not understanding.""

Joe Roof said he's lost his grandson, who turned 23 last week, and said today is likely the last time he will see him. ""I'm just aching to hold him and hug him as I did when he was a tot,"" he said.

He added: ""The system which I worked in almost 60 years now and believe in seems to have worked as it should have worked.""

Family members of Roof's nine victims also spoke.

Nadine Collier, daughter of victim Ethel Lance, who was thrust into the spotlight after she told Dylann Roof she forgave him at his bond hearing less than 48 hours after the shooting, said today she still forgives him and now she is moving on.

""Today I wanted to address the court. I wanted to say to Dylann Roof I’m the one that forgave you in the bond hearing, and I still do today,"" Collier said.

""He came here to start a battle -- but I win the war,"" Collier continued. ""I wore white today to let everybody know the chapter in my life right now today is closed. I will not open that book again. And I just want to say have mercy on your soul.""

Melvin Graham, brother of victim Cynthia Hurd, was emotional as he spoke in court, saying he wanted to let Hurd speak for herself. Graham read an email that Hurd sent to their sister in 2013; Graham said Hurd sent the email when their sister was having a difficult time handling the death of their parents.

In the email, which Graham read aloud, Hurd said that Easter was her favorite holiday because it reminded her that death is not forever and they will have the chance to be reunited one day.

Blondell Gadsden, sister of victim Myra Thompson, said to the court of Dylann Roof, ""Even though we're at a point where death has been the sentence for him, my heart still goes out to him in hopes that he would repent to save himself from himself.""

""I can't think of anything worse that he could do at this point than to not accept Christ and try to make his days on this earth a little bit more peaceful,"" Gadsden added. ""I come here today not to do anything more than to thank the court system and on behalf of my family say that we are pleased with everything that has been done.""

Dylann Roof, who was sentenced to death in January in his federal trial, today pleaded guilty to all state charges, including nine counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder, instead of going through a second trial.

Dylann Roof's guilty plea in state court was in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of parole.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/key-moments-charleston-church-shooting-case-dylann-roof/story?id=46701033,"Nearly two years after Dylann Roof opened fire at a Bible study at a Charleston, South Carolina, church, killing nine black parishioners, the convicted killer pleaded guilty today in state court.

Roof, who turned 23 last week, has already been convicted of hate crimes in a federal case and has been sentenced to death for the murders at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church in June 2015.

As Roof returned to court this afternoon, here is a look back at the pivotal moments in the Charleston church tragedy.

June 17, 2015: The shooting

The night of June 17, 2015, 21-year-old Roof, who is white, entered the Emanuel AME Church and attended a Bible study, where he was welcomed by the parishioners, according to authorities. Roof then drew his pistol and opened fire, authorities said.

Felicia Sanders, a survivor of the shooting, later testified that when Roof opened fire she clutched her granddaughter tight and told her to play dead.

""I could feel the warm blood flowing on each side of me,"" she said.

""I was just waiting on my turn,"" she added. ""Even if I got shot, I just didn't want my granddaughter to get shot.""

Amid the chaos and the bloodshed, her youngest son, Tywanza Sanders, stood up and confronted the assailant: ""Why are you doing this?"" he asked, according to Felicia Sanders' testimony.

""And he told our son, 'I have to do this because y'all raping our women and taking over the world,'"" Felicia Sanders said. ""And that's when [the gunman] put about five bullets in my son.

""We watched him take his last breath,"" she said of her son. ""I watched my son come into this world, and I watched my son leave this world.""

After fatally shooting nine people, Roof walked out the door, to his car and fled, leaving the carnage behind him.

June 18, 2015: A suspect is captured

The morning after the massacre, Roof was apprehended at a traffic stop in Shelby, North Carolina, about 245 miles north of the Charleston church.

Roof had a handwritten note in his car with the names of several churches on it, a Confederate flag, a burned U.S. flag, a gun, an empty box of ammunition and a laser attachment for a gun that helps with accuracy, according to authorities.

June 19, 2015: Victims' families offer forgiveness

Less than 48 hours after the shooting, some victims' family members spoke at Roof's first court appearance and offered forgiveness to the 21-year-old.

“I forgive you,” Nadine Collier, the daughter of victim Ethel Lance, said through tears to Roof, who appeared at the bond hearing via video conferencing from jail. ""You took something very precious from me and I will never talk to her ever again. I will never be able to hold her again. But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.""

Reuters

Anthony Thompson, the husband of victim Myra Thompson, said, ""I forgive you. But we would like you to take this opportunity to repent. Repent, confess, give your life to the one who matters most: Christ. So that he can change it, can change your ways no matter what happened to you and you'll be OK. Do that and you'll be better off than what you are right now.""

Dec. 15, 2016: A guilty verdict in federal hate crimes case

On Dec. 15, 2016, Roof was found guilty on all 33 counts in his federal trial, including hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death.

During the emotional trial, survivor Polly Sheppard testified that she saw Roof shoot another churchgoer, then she ducked under a table.

Sheppard testified that Roof told her to shut up as she was praying out loud.

Then, she said, Roof asked her whether she was shot. She told him no, she added, and he replied that he wouldn't shoot her. ""I’m going to leave you alive to tell the story,"" Sheppard said Roof told her.

A video interview of Roof conducted by an FBI agent shortly after he was captured was also played in court. In the video Roof laughed as he admitted to the shooting.

In the video Roof said he used a .45-caliber Glock to commit the crime. ""I didn't say anything to them before I pulled it out, not even one word,"" Roof says of the gun in the video. ""I mean, they reacted after I shot them.""

""I am guilty,"" he said in the video, laughing.

Defense attorney David Bruck said in court that Roof committed the crime but the trial involves understanding ""who this person was and why on earth he would want to cause so much grief.""

Jan. 10, 2017: Roof sentenced to death in federal case

Roof was sentenced to death Jan. 10, 2017, the first time a death penalty verdict was rendered in a federal hate crimes case, the Justice Department said.

The jury's decision had to be unanimous to sentence Roof to death.

The jury spent less than one day deliberating Roof's fate, after Roof told the jurors in a closing statement in the sentencing phase, ""I still feel like I had to do it.""

In the government's closing argument in the sentencing phase, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson said that before the killings, Roof's racist hatred had built up for years. Roof scouted the Emanuel AME Church months before, calling and visiting, Richardson said.

After Roof left the scene of the shooting, Richardson said, he ""fully understood the horrific nature"" of his crime.

While Roof expressed sorrow to his parents and pity for himself, he didn't shed a tear for the people he killed, Richardson said. Roof showed multiple times that he didn't have remorse, according to Richardson, from his jailhouse manifesto with racist language to the shoes he wore in court during the federal trial that had racist symbols on them.

Roof's defense said in a statement at the time that the ""sentencing decision means that this case will not be over for a very long time. We are sorry that, despite our best efforts, the legal proceedings have shed so little light on the reasons for this tragedy.""

The defense added that they express sympathy ""to all of the families who were so grievously hurt by Dylann Roof’s actions.""

Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement, ""Roof sought out and opened fire on African-American parishioners engaged in worship. ... He did so because of their race. And he did so to interfere with their peaceful exercise of religion. The victims in the case led lives as compassionate civic and religious leaders; devoted public servants and teachers; and beloved family members and friends.

""No verdict can bring back the nine we lost that day at Mother Emanuel,"" Lynch continued. ""And no verdict can heal the wounds of the five church members who survived the attack or the souls of those who lost loved ones to Roof’s callous hand. But we hope that the completion of the prosecution provides the people of Charleston -- and the people of our nation -- with a measure of closure.""

April 10, 2017: Roof pleads guilty in state case

Roof today pleaded guilty to all state charges, including nine counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder, instead of going through a second trial.

Roof's grandfather Joe Roof addressed the court for the first time today, saying ""We’re sorry,"" and adding, ""Dylann is not all bad.""

""What happened here I will never understand,"" Joe Roof said. ""I will go to my grave not understanding.""

Dylann Roof's guilty plea in state court was in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Ninth Circuit Solicitor Scarlett Wilson said today that the mission for the guilty plea was to get the ""surest path to Dylann Roof's execution"" in connection with the federal trial.

Malcolm Graham, the brother of victim Cynthia Hurd, said today, ""The sun is shining bright. She is smiling down. Justice was served today.""

James Jackson, 28, who is accused of fatally stabbing 66-year-old Timothy Caughman on March 20, is the first defendant charged with murder as an act of terrorism in Manhattan since the statute was revised after the 9/11 attacks.

According to Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, Jackson, an Army veteran from Baltimore, ""prowled the streets of New York for three days in search of a black person to assassinate in order to launch a campaign of terrorism against our Manhattan community and the values we celebrate.""

“With total presence of mind, he acted on his plan, randomly selecting a beloved New Yorker solely on the basis of his skin color, and stabbing him repeatedly and publicly on a Midtown street corner,"" Vance said in an earlier statement. ""James Jackson wanted to kill black men, planned to kill black men, and then did kill a black man.""

Jackson has been charged with one count of murder in the first degree as an act of terrorism; one count of murder in the second degree as an act of terrorism; one count of murder in the second degree as a hate crime; and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.

In court this morning Jackson didn't say anything beyond entering his not guilty plea.

A 14-year-old boy faces charges of aggravated criminal sexual assault and making and disseminating child pornography in connection to the case, and Police Commander Brendan Deenihan said in a press conference that an arrest warrant has also been issued for another teenage boy, and police expect to charge others, including one adult.

""The detectives working with Facebook have executed several social media search warrants and we were able to eventually identify two of these offenders and secure arrests warrants for them,"" Deenihan announced.

""One of the offenders [the 14-year-old] ... has now been charged,"" he said. ""There's a second juvenile warrant that is out there and we expect that individual to be arrested soon and then additionally we still have several other offenders that we need to specifically identify and are arrested as well.""

About 40 people viewed the attack live, and none of them reported it, police said.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson led off the press conference with passionate words about the victim.

""As a father of young women myself, I am so inspired by her strength, and while I know the emotional wounds caused by this savagery will take long to heal, I'm hopeful that her story can be an inspiration to so many other young women who are victimized by bullying and sexual assault,"" Johnson said.

Johnson said that he was first approached by the 15-year-old girl's mother, who she said ""had been missing for more than 24 hours"" and then showed him ""snapshots of a video which depicted her daughter being sexually assaulted live on the internet.""

""No woman should ever be treated the way this young woman was,"" Johnson said.

Johnson, who has become a recognizable face nationally due to the press conferences he's given regarding Chicago's shooting epidemic, also scolded those who participated.

""Due to the graphic content that I observed, I don't want to go into the details of what was on the video but I want to tell you the young [men] responsible, they should be ashamed of themselves,"" Johnson said.

""They’ve humiliated themselves, humiliated their families, and now they're going to be held accountable for what they've done,"" he added.

The case is not the first high profile crime broadcast live on Facebook this year to come out of Chicago.

Earlier in the year, a man was tortured in a Facebook Live video, before eventually escaping his captors.

That case was categorized as a hate crime, and had strong racial overtones, with four black suspects binding and attacking a white special-needs teenager.

James Jackson, 28, an Army veteran from Baltimore, ""prowled the streets of New York for three days in search of a black person to assassinate in order to launch a campaign of terrorism against our Manhattan community and the values we celebrate,” Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance said.

Today a grand jury returned an indictment against Jackson, who is accused of fatally stabbing 66-year-old Timothy Caughman last week.

Jackson was charged with one count of murder in the first degree as an act of terrorism; one count of murder in the second degree as an act of terrorism; one count of murder in the second degree as a hate crime; and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.

“Last week, with total presence of mind, he acted on his plan, randomly selecting a beloved New Yorker solely on the basis of his skin color, and stabbing him repeatedly and publicly on a Midtown street corner,"" Vance said.

""James Jackson wanted to kill black men, planned to kill black men, and then did kill a black man,"" Vance said.

In a jailhouse interview with the Daily News, Jackson reportedly said of his victim, “I didn’t know he was elderly.""

He also reportedly told the Daily News he would have rather killed “a young thug” or “a successful older black man with blonds.""

Jackson reportedly said he wanted the murder to be “a practice run” for a bigger plan that would have more casualties, which he also allegedly told investigators.

Vance said that Jackson chose Midtown ""because Manhattan is the media capital of the world, and a place where people of different races live together and love one another. We must never take for granted New York’s remarkable diversity. We must celebrate it, protect it, and refuse to let violence and hate undermine the progress we have made as a city, a state, and a nation.”

Jackson's next court date is set for April 13. His lawyer, Sam Talkin, declined comment to ABC News today, but said after his initial appearance in court that he would consider an insanity defense.

""If the facts are anything near what the allegations are, then we're going to address obvious psychological issues present,"" Talkin said. “We are going to let the dust settle and take a few minutes.""",abcnews.com,True

The suspect's father has also been arrested for the same charges, an Israeli government official said.

Police believe the man made fake bomb threats in New Zealand and Australia and against scores of Jewish institutions across the U.S.

Tina Macintyre-Yee/Democrat and Chronicle/USA TODAY

He also allegedly called in fake bomb threats to two Delta flights at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport in 2015, according to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.

The threats grounded the flights while passengers were evacuated and luggage was rescreened.

The suspect was arrested early this morning in his family's home in the southern city of Ashkelon after a monthslong investigation that included the FBI and European law enforcement agencies, Rosenfeld said. The teenager resisted arrest, Rosenfeld said, explaining that the teen moved toward one of the arresting officers in what is believed to have been an attempt to grab the officer’s sidearm, but the teen never reached the gun.

Israeli police confiscated several computers, antennas, satellite equipment and other advanced technology. Some of the equipment was allegedly used to ""camouflage"" the suspect's voice for automated calls, Rosenfeld said. He added that the suspect also allegedly had equipment that allowed him to use many IP addresses, making it hard to trace him.

Bryan Woolston/Reuters

The suspect appeared in an Israeli court today, and the judge ruled that his identity would not be released until his next court appearance on March 30.

According to an official briefed on the investigation, the suspect had been deemed insufficiently mentally stable to be drafted into the Israeli Army.

The suspect's attorney, Galit Bash, told ABC News in a statement, ""This is a young man without a criminal record who suffers from serious medical problems from a young age. There is a concern that his medical condition affects his cognitive functions. In light of this, we asked the court to order the young man to undergo a medical examination. The court accepted our arguments and ordered the police to examine the young man's medical condition.""

Police have not commented on the teen's motives. It is unclear if he will be tried in Israel or the U.S., police said.

Jerry Silverman, president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America, said it was ""heartbreaking to learn that a Jewish man is a prime suspect.""

Doron Krakow, the president and CEO of the JCC Association of North America, said the organization is ""troubled to learn that the individual suspected of making these threats against Jewish Community Centers — which play a central role in the Jewish community, as well as serve as inclusive and welcoming places for all — is reportedly Jewish.""

He continued, ""Emblematic of the strength of JCCs and the important model they represent for acceptance, inclusion and appreciation for diversity is the remarkable support we have received from communities and community leaders across North America, including civic, political and faith community leaders. Throughout this long running period of concern and disruption that we are hopeful has come to an end, JCCs have had the opportunity to review and assess our security protocols and procedures, and we are confident that JCCs are safer today than ever before.""

Bryan Woolston/Reuters

Gilad Erdan, Israel's minister of public security, said in a statement after reports of the arrest, ""I congratulate the Israeli police on leading a complex international investigation, together with law enforcement agencies from around the world, which led to the arrest of the suspect. We hope that this investigation will help shed light on some of the recent threats against Jewish institutions, which have caused great concern both among Jewish communities and the Israeli government.""

The FBI said in a statement, ""Investigating hate crimes is a top priority for the FBI, and we will continue to work to make sure all races and religions feel safe in their communities and in their places of worship.""

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the arrest ""the culmination of a large-scale investigation spanning multiple continents for hate crimes against Jewish communities across our country.""

""The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate the targeting of any community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs,"" he said in a statement. ""I commend the FBI and Israeli national police for their outstanding work on this case.”

Across the U.S. this year, there have been five waves of bomb threats at JCCs and Jewish schools. The JCC Association of North America reported 100 incidents this year alone. No bombs were found at any of the locations. The FBI and the Justice Department's civil rights division were investigating the incidents.

While the threats were false, Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, told ABC News earlier this month the threats created ""terror"" for the people evacuated from the facilities — including preschool children, the elderly and teenagers — as well as their family members.

Wilfredo Lee/AP Photo

In a statement today he said called the crimes ""acts of anti-Semitism.""

""These threats targeted Jewish institutions, were calculated to sow fear and anxiety and put the entire Jewish community on high alert,"" Greenblatt said. ""Even though it appears that the main culprit behind the majority of these attacks has allegedly been identified, anti-Semitism in the U.S. remains a very serious concern. No arrests have been made in three cemetery desecrations or a series of other anti-Semitic incidents involving swastika graffiti and hate fliers. JCCs and other institutions should not relax security measures or become less vigilant.""

A former journalist arrested in the U.S. earlier this month was accused of making at least eight threats against JCCs, Jewish schools, a Jewish museum and the Anti-Defamation League. The man was not believed to be the main suspect behind this year's rash of bomb threats.

Authorities today identified the suspect as James Harris Jackson, 28, of Maryland, an Army veteran who'd served in Afghanistan.

Assistant Chief Bill Aubry said that Jackson has a deep-seated hatred of black people. Police say he allegedly wrote a manifesto about attacking blacks in New York City.

""It is believed that he was specifically intending to target male blacks for assault,"" he said. ""The reason why he picked New York is because it's the media capital of the world and he wanted to make a statement.""

He is in custody and is being charged with murder, police said. Jackson has not yet entered a plea and is expected to be arraigned this evening.

Police said Jackson had been harboring these feelings toward black males for more than 10 years.

""Based on statements that he made, the subject, as well as a preliminary review of video, it reveals that the attack on [victim] Timothy Caughman was clearly racially motivated,"" Aubry said during a news conference today.

Aubry said Jackson arrived from Baltimore, Maryland, on Friday via BoltBus and then stayed at a Midtown hotel from Friday to Monday afternoon. Aubry said video surveillance footage had captured Jackson wandering through the city.

Police said the fatal stabbing occurred around 11:15 p.m. Monday, as Caughman, a can and bottle recycler, was rifling through the trash.

Police said Jackson walked into a police substation in Times Square a little after midnight today, allegedly saying that he was wanted for a murder that had occurred 24 hours earlier.

Knives were found in his possession, police said. Aubry said police had recovered a 26-inch black mini sword, which investigators believe to be the murder weapon. Aubry said that Jackson did not attack anyone else.

More than 40 tombstones were overturned at Washington Cemetery in the borough's Midwood neighborhood. The NYPD's hate crimes division was notified and investigated the matter. Investigators later said environmental factors and maintenance likely caused the damage, ABC News' New York station WABC reported.

New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind Saturday night tweeted photos of the overturned tombstones, writing that the neighborhood watch group Boro Park Shomrim ""alerted me that stones @ Washington Cemetery are down. I've spoken w/ the NYPD who are investigating. I'll be there in the am.""

In a statement following the investigation, Hikind alluded that the headstones had been targeted for nefarious reasons.

""More than 40 headstones were overturned. These stones were all in the same section where barbed-wire had been cut. Despite the fact that there are thousands upon thousands of graves stretching over many blocks, this was the only section where gravestones had been turned over,"" the statement said. ""This area is less than 5% of the total cemetery grounds.""

""So strong winds hit this section and left the other ones alone? I find that hard to believe. Something is definitely not kosher,"" the statement concluded.

Tomer Hemed, a striker with Brighton & Hove Albion F.C., posted to his social media accounts last week a photo of himself showing a Star of David shaved into his hair.

""Always representing #starofdavid #jewish #israel #proudtobejewish #bhafc,"" wrote Hemed, 29, who is married to model and former Miss Israel Shunit Faragi.

The Community Security Trust, a British charity which monitors anti-Semitic incidents and works with police to gather data, said in January that recorded incidents of anti-Semitism in 2016 had increased by 36 percent from 2015.

British lawmakers have also become increasingly more vocal. Earlier this year, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid, a Conservative, said, ""Anti-Semitism must be understood for what it is -- an attack on the identity of people who live, contribute and are valued in our society.

And at the other end of the political spectrum, the Labour Party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, said, ""We must root out anti-Semitism whenever it takes place and wherever it exists, as a party and as a country.""

Earlier this week, during a parliamentary session, Prime Minister Theresa May also addressed anti-Semitism on university campuses, saying, ""Higher education institutions have a responsibility to ensure that they provide a safe and inclusive environment for all students, and we expect them to have robust policies and procedures in place to comply with the law, to investigate, and to swiftly address [any] hate crime, including any anti-Semitic incidents that are reported.""

http://abcnews.go.com/US/man-accused-making-threats-jewish-community-centers-arrested/story?id=45884069,"A man accused of making at least eight threats against Jewish community centers, Jewish schools, a Jewish museum and the Anti-Defamation League was arrested by the FBI in St. Louis, Missouri, this morning, though the man is not believed to be the main suspect behind this year's rash of bomb threats, two law enforcement officials told ABC News.

Juan Thompson, 31, is accused of what federal prosecutors called a “campaign to harass and intimidate.” He’s charged in New York with cyberstalking a New York City woman by communicating threats in the woman’s name. Prosecutors said Thompson, a former journalist, appears to have made those threats ""as part of a sustained campaign to harass and intimidate” the woman after their romantic relationship ended.

@JuanMThompson/Twitter

He is accused of making threats over the course of Jan. 28 to Feb. 22 against the Anti-Defamation League office in New York, a Jewish history museum in New York, as well as JCCs and Jewish schools in New York, Michigan, Dallas and San Diego.

Law enforcement officials told ABC News Thompson appeared to take advantage of news coverage of the threats in order to exact revenge on a woman who had ended a romantic relationship.

Bric TV/YouTube

Thompson made an initial appearance today in St. Louis and did not enter a plea. His next hearing is scheduled for March 8.

Meanwhile, FBI Director James Comey met with Jewish community leaders today to discuss the recent uptick in threats against Jewish institutions.

#FBI Dir. & sr. execs met w/ community leaders about threats to Jewish institutions & to affirm FBI's commitment to ensure safe communities pic.twitter.com/u07T94T4Jb — FBI (@FBI) March 3, 2017

The FBI said in a statement that ""the investigation into these threats is a top priority"" and that ""agents and analysts across the country are working to identify and stop those responsible.""

""The FBI is committed to ensuring that people of all races and religions feel safe in their communities and places of worship,"" the FBI said.

After Thompson's arrest, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio released a statement, thanking law enforcement ""for aggressively pursuing and arresting a suspect in a disgusting series of threats against Jewish Community Centers. When you attack someone because of who they are, how they worship or who they love, you are attacking our democracy.""

New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill added, ""The defendant caused havoc, expending hundreds of hours of police and law enforcement resources to respond and investigate these threats. We will continue to pursue those who pedal fear, making false claims about serious crimes.""

According to the NYPD, hate crimes are up this year in NYC, driven primarily by anti-Semitic bias crimes.

Thompson's arrest comes after five waves of bomb threats at JCCs and Jewish schools nationwide this year. The JCC Association of North America reported a total of 100 incidents this year alone. No bombs were found at any of the locations. The FBI and the Justice Department's civil rights division are investigating the incidents.

Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, told ABC News earlier this week that JCC threats created ""terror"" for the people evacuated from the facilities — including preschool children, the elderly and teenagers — as well as their family members.

""This is absolutely abnormal, and it is totally unacceptable that anyone, anywhere, at any time could be terrorized because of their faith,"" he said.

The most recent wave -- which did not include any of the threats Thompson is accused of making -- was this past Monday when 31 bomb threats were called into 23 JCCs and eight Jewish day schools in Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington state, and Canada, the JCC Association of North America said. All schools received the all clear from law enforcement, the JCC Association of North America said.

Wilfredo Lee/AP Photo

Karen Kolodny, executive director of the JCC of Mid-Westchester in Scarsdale, New York, one of the 31 centers to receive a threat, told ABC News today that she was expecting to eventually ""be on the target list.""

""We knew at some point it would be our turn,"" she said.

Once the JCC received the phone threat Monday morning, the center -- which includes early childhood programs, senior programs and after school programs -- was evacuated. Police cleared the building within hours and the center reopened. The center has been doing drills for years and teachers undergo training, Kolodny noted.

""We had no indications of fear from the kids, and that's because the teachers are trained to stay calm,"" she said.

To Kolodny, the bomb threat ""was an attempt at harassment and an attempt to disturb the normal routine of average citizens, and we are not going to let it deter us in the operation of our building and in the programs we offer to community ... we won't be harassed.""

She added, ""JCCs are not just Jewish community centers. We are open to and we serve the entire community here. We don't ask for people's religions ... it's not our business. Our doors are open to everyone.""

In the wake of these threats, ""there's so much public outpouring of support for JCCs. If the goal was to destabilize the JCCS, we're still in business, and we're going to continue to be in business. This is a failed attempt at targeting the community and it just won't work,"" Kolodny emphasized.

The JCC in Indianapolis, Indiana, which also received a bomb threat, wrote on Instagram, ""A neighbor stopped by today to say she was thinking of us. Brought dozens of roses for us to share with staff.""

The uptick in anti-Semitism extends beyond bomb threats.

According to Greenblatt, there has been a graffiti at synagogues, a ""tsunami of anti-Semitic slander on social media"" and attacks at Jewish cemeteries.

Since Feb. 20, Jewish cemeteries have been desecrated in University City, Missouri; Philadelphia and Rochester, New York. Authorities are investigating all three cases.

Evan Bernstein, New York regional director at the Anti-Defamation League -- one of the institutions Thompson is accused of targeting -- today thanked law enforcement for Thompson's arrest.

""Just because there's been an arrest ... does not mean the threats have disappeared or will stop,"" she said at a press conference. ""Hate towards the Jewish community and other minority groups is very real and deeply concerning. There is a lot of work that still needs to be done.""

David Posner, the director of strategic performance at the JCC Association of North America, in a statement Monday called on the FBI, the White House, the Justice Department, the Homeland Security Department, Congress and local officials to ""speak out forcefully against this scourge of anti-Semitism"" across the U.S. and to catch the ""perpetrators, who are trying to instill anxiety and fear in our communities.""

On Feb. 21, President Trump for the first time directly addressed recent incidents of anti-Semitism after he received backlash from various groups. Speaking at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., he called the JCC threats a ""painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.""

Attorney General Jeff Sessions told reporters Monday, ""I have seen the Jewish synagogue attacks, threats and things, which is a very serious and disruptive practice. This Department of Justice will do what it can to assist in pushing back against that and prosecuting anybody who was a part of it.""",abcnews.com,True

Gibson was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the New Orleans Police Department.

Gibson, a transgender woman and drag performer, lived in California and was visiting friends in her native New Orleans when she was gunned down, according to ABC affiliate WGNO.

The New Orleans Police Department released images of two people who they believe may have information about Gibson’s death. The individuals are not wanted for the killing but are only wanted for questioning, police said.

Two days later and a few miles away on Columbus Street, responding officers found an “unknown black male” suffering from stab wounds shortly before 9 a.m. local time on Feb. 27. The victim was transported to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries, according to a statement from the New Orleans Police Department.

According to WGNO, the victim was another transgender woman, Ciara McElveen.

Police said video surveillance from the area suggests the victim arrived in a two-door black Chevrolet Camaro with chrome rims.

Witnesses later told detectives they saw a man in a black car leave the vehicle and remove something from the trunk. The man then walked around to the passenger side where he apparently stabbed the victim, police said. The victim was removed from the car and fell to the ground. Witnesses told detectives they then saw the suspect get back in the car and drive off.

The New Orleans Police Department released images of a vehicle of interest in connection with the stabbing death. Authorities are seeking to speak with the vehicle’s owner, as they believe this individual may have information pertinent to the investigation.

Indian Consul General Dr. Anupam Ray met Ian Grillot and his family at the University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, thanking him for his efforts during a Feb. 22 shooting at Austin's Bar & Grill in Olathe, Kansas, in which two Indians living in the U.S. were shot in what the FBI is investigating as a hate crime.

""We will stand with you,"" Ray said after shaking Grillot's hand.

In the February attack, Srinivas Kuchibhotla was fatally shot, while his friend Alok Madasani was wounded. Grillot was the third victim, shot by the gunmen after trying to intervene to stop him.

The alleged shooter, Adam W. Purinton, is currently being held on charges of first-degree murder and two counts of premeditated attempted murder.

During Thursday's meeting, Ray showed Grillot a tweet from India's minister of external affairs praising his actions and saluting his ""heroism."" Ray told Grillot that his bravery was more indicative of the U.S. than the violence that he witnessed in Kansas last month.

major developments from the white house tonight. President trump's first major address to congress and the American people. Generating many headlines for its strikingly different tone, and there was that emotional moment when the president singled out the Navy S.E.A.L. Widow killed in that controversial raid in Yemen. ABC's Jon Karl tonight. Reporter: An upbeat president met with Republican leaders today buzzing about dramatic change in tone in the president's speech last night. Right off the bat, he was reaching out, giving a nod to black history month, and president condemning a recent epidemic of hate crimes he has been slow to acknowledge, including the vandalism of jewish cemeteries and the threats against jewish community centers across the country now being investigated by the FBI. Recent threats targeting jewish community centers and vandalism of jewish cemeteries as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. Reporter: Trump got members of both parties on their feet during the speech's emotional high point, his tribute to Navy S.E.A.L., Ryan Owens, killed in Yemen during the controversial raid. The president approved just a week after he took office. When the president traveled to Dover air force base to witness the return of the fallen S.E.A.L., Owens's father refused to meet with him. But last night his widow was there right next to Ivanka Trump. Ryan died as he lived, a warrior, and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation. Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you. Reporter: The applause lasted for almost a whole two minutes. Ryan is looking down right now. You know that. And he is very happy because I think he just broke a record. Reporter: And in stark contrast to the combative tone of the president's first weeks in office, a near total reversal, especially this line which could be taken as a criticism of the president himself. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. Reporter: The positive tone was a hit with many critics, amid the good reviews, the white house today abruptly postposed signing a new version of the president's controversial travel ban, something the president has called an urgent matter of national security. But for now, at least, it will wait. A bid, perhaps, to let the big speech moment sink in. Let's get to Jon Karl live at the white house tonight, and Jon, you mention there, the delay now in the president's new executive order. We know at first, it banned citizens from seven muslim-majority countries, and among them, Iraq, and you hear that could come off the list? Reporter: I'm told the current version of the travel ban, Iraq has been removed at the urging of state department officials and defense secretary Mattis who both made the case that Iraq is a critical partner in the fight against ISIS. Including them in the ban could hinder that fight.

Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers. And vandalism. Of Jewish cemeteries. As well as last week shooting in Kansas City. Remind us that while we may be a nation divided and piles. We are a country that stands united. In condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly for. So I struck a walk optimistic tone and he has I think in the past spent. You know people are questioning you know was this theater how Long Will it last went what is this what did you watch what did you find I. So let you put down racism and anti semitism that's optimistic that should be. Do Rivera's they say that's the regular hey come on air into the inaugurations to teach this Liz that was very gloomy and like Warren you know this home was did banner iced. Yes I think that's true act yeah I ask what happened was the likes of Steve batted in the people like Kim were behind the scenes running this very much like a political campaign. And I think Donald Trump and some of the we're moderate people said this isn't working people feel marginalized and I I'm hoping that he realized that. I know he admitted on FOX & Friends the day before or earlier that day that has messaging had been off and he gave himself in a C or C minus in terms of messaging and wondering if there hasn't been some realization that. He may have an agenda that he dean's positive for the country but he's isolating a lot of people this for me was more optimistic I think he should reach across the aisle want policy. I had predicted that he would talk about infrastructure development which is something Democrats often get behind. He talked about paid leave he talked about working like Bob Allen nations need to to fight easily gather against. A lot about Ibaka trumps I think pet projects and yeah that she's been very active in the White House he's taken a lot of originally didn't regret my how he. Paid sentiment cleansed who paid family leave. Yeah Democrats have been yeah I'm very different time it's a much more liberals like it has been at the end while right now it has but I think Republicans many times and he's opposed that and Ibaka had come out supported yet and I were saying it will trump that not only that we saw her hands 500 is a lot it and that's part of that was heartening for what I I. I'm tell yet you know at. That is. Listening to him what he's at. Add to say about hate crimes and things and doesn't matter that hours before he spoke out against the hate crimes. He claimed that some of them could have been committed by people who just want to make him look bad I. And I've got about him that's that's the problem I think with the speech it was a good speech I think he delivered it well he read it on top teleprompter but it's not so much the speech it's what policies that what he's Dowayne behind the scenes. And we know that he east its saint phase when he is unscripted. That are. Are really story and there's a disconnect so on the one hand he doesn't like the crime is going up and he talks about Chicago a lot at the same time he signed signed some kind of legislation that says that mentally ill people showed up and he's having easier access to god yes. So those are the things that Americans need to really think at Anaheim Gadhafi he says that he won he would promote clean Aaron clean water. But then he did tries to dismantle the Clean Water Act. And puts in a guy and the EPA who wants to dismantle them pollute the streams so it doesn't matter what you know I was like don't listen to what he's saying listen to what he's doing yet will he is is that. Up front I didn't I didn't vote for him. But I have been waiting for him to come out and say anything that resembles I'm everyone's president or uniting us. And although I agree that weathered the sincerity was there police hours before he it's and something otherwise. I I'd rather have him do something like this than what he's been doing which is doubling down on stupid stuff that he said. I don't care he's faking it let's fake it until we start let me change it's you that if it thought it was a it was better now that he's been a group. For me it is just you know when you come out of the gate. You know and you start bets you he started that you know he started started with the Mexicans and rapists and not. And when you double down you're going to go what you get all the backing from the white supremacist groups and you don'ts today. Right as soon as it happens not know I'm not I'm just about that yes. And it takes you four MR. To talk about the fact that Jewish cemeteries and and that JC seize up being. Bombarded by people who are. What essentially field they have been given the right to dig that's why do you the president on her I need I don't need it Kansas Saint Louis. You know but that's family that it you know why I've gotten said he listens to me and believes in what I believed killed two people. He mentioned it briefly it down the gossip says he's a supporter of mine I'm not a supporter of his that was horrific and it Nellis families. Had been and that gallery also. I might feel a little bit like okay you are start again at MI but because when somebody's dust up in your name. That's what she just about all south. I don't make that big dive in make that a I don't know what I said yeah heart is gonna change I've said this before it that majority of his speeches thus far in talks in wanted to be about Atmel. You aren't only spoken to him what I voice heard as it's not that he's against these groups he doesn't get an apathy towards them because if you worked for candid. He's not for you he continues to speak for the people that supported him acts I don't think he's going to change his heart all the sudden having embedded EA he doesn't act that he. Doesn't have a hard is it fair to say anything you can't have a heart I I said a change of heart I'm not expecting him to all of a sudden he still up lake. It disgusted by some things that happens out I don't think that's gonna change that and I think that. I'm saying that Exxon or of the right light wage and this was a step in the right direction. No I don't unbiased consumer policy though I'm I'm seeing sun lot of policy. I mean I did I heard with respect to eight you know border security act. I think we hear specifics well here's nothing articulate or know that land sales allegations in this and you don't get its act like they're not like to hear more specifics but. With respect to immigration I've been hearing that there's been a shift where he may actually looking into granting legal status to undocumented people who are here with not an if I had not today in this yesterday about it. There are some been some internal circulation out there. I don't think Donald Trump is a hard right kind of guy I do think inside internally if you listen to past statements he made before he ran for president this time.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/communities-cope-recent-anti-semitic-attacks-jewish-officials/story?id=45800345,"After tombstones were found toppled at Jewish cemeteries in Missouri and Pennsylvania and nearly 100 Jewish Community Centers and schools nationwide received bomb threats, Jewish leaders are urging President Trump to take action.

On Monday, 21 bomb threats were called in to 13 JCCs and eight Jewish schools in Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia, the JCC Association of North America said. No bombs were found at any locations.

There have been 90 incidents this year alone, at 73 locations in 30 states and one Canadian province, the JCC Association said. The FBI and the Justice Department's civil rights division are investigating.

While the threats were false, Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, told ABC News the threats created ""terror"" for the people evacuated from the facilities — including preschool children, the elderly and teenagers — as well as their family members.

""This is absolutely abnormal, and it is totally unacceptable that anyone, anywhere, at any time could be terrorized because of their faith,"" he said.

David Posner, the director of strategic performance at the JCC Association of North America, told ABC News that as far as the organization knows, ""the FBI has not yet determined who the perpetrators are, so we do not yet know what their motives are."" But he added that he sees a ""general rise in the level of intolerance in this nation now, and I think it gives the feeling that people can act with greater impunity.""

Besides bomb threats, two Jewish cemeteries have been vandalized in one week. On Feb. 20, over 100 tombstones were found overturned at the Chesed Shel Emeth Society cemetery in University City, Missouri. On Sunday in Philadelphia, over 100 headstones were discovered toppled and cracked at the city's Mount Carmel Cemetery. Authorities are investigating both cases.

Rabbi Yosef Goldman of Philadelphia's Temple Beth Zion–Beth Israel recalled seeing ""row upon row of toppled tombstones"" at Mount Carmel Cemetery.

""Many of them weighed several hundred pounds,"" he said. ""What I saw was devastating.""

Steve Rosenberg, an official with the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia who visited the cemetery, said, ""It was clearly a deliberate act of violence and desecration.""

""It took a lot of effort and intention to commit this crime ... Headstones are very heavy, and some of them are gigantic — the size of a car,"" he added. ""This had to be a group of people that were here for a long time.""

The Philadelphia Police Department announced Tuesday that the rewards for information leading to an arrest and conviction had risen to a total of $50,000, from an initial $13,000: the Anti-Defamation League, through the Mizel Family Foundation, is offering a $10,000 reward; councilman Allan Domb is offering a $12,000 reward, mayor Jim Kenney is offering a $15,000 reward, an anonymous donor is offering a $10,000 reward, and the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5 is offering a $3,000 Reward for information leading to an arrest only.

Greenblatt said the anti-Semitism extends beyond cemetery vandalism and threats to JCCs to graffiti at synagogues and a ""tsunami of anti-Semitic slander on social media.""

Religious attacks in the past week were also aimed at the Muslim community; investigators said a fire at a Florida mosque on Feb. 24 was intentionally set.

Goldman and Greenblatt, who both noted a surge of anti-Semitism and hate crimes since the presidential election, pointed to the role of the Trump administration.

""We have not seen — until last week — our political leadership speak out in a strong way against these incidents,"" Greenblatt said.

When anti-Semitism was not immediately condemned by the White House, ""extremists felt emboldened,"" he added.

""Words have consequences, and a lack of words have consequences,"" he said.

On Feb. 21, Trump for the first time directly addressed recent incidents of anti-Semitism after he received backlash from various groups. Speaking at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., he called the recent JCC threats a ""painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.""

While Goldman said ""it will take more than a single statement"" from Trump ""to show that he is serious about combating the rise of anti-Semitism,"" Greenblatt said the president's statement was ""really appreciated.""

He added, ""Now is the time to move from words to action. Now is the time for our leaders to not only speak out but to step up and apply the full force of the federal government to addressing anti-Semitism ... We're prepared to work with the administration to help make that happen.""

Vice President Mike Pence visited the desecrated Missouri cemetery last week and condemned the act.

MO's people are inspiring the nation w/ their compassion for the Jewish community. Thank you for showing the world what America is all about pic.twitter.com/PWTFLGqqz0 — Vice President Pence (@VP) February 22, 2017

In a statement Monday, Posner of the JCC Association called on the FBI, the White House, the Justice Department, the Homeland Security Department, Congress and local officials to ""speak out forcefully against this scourge of anti-Semitism"" across the U.S. and to catch the ""perpetrators, who are trying to instill anxiety and fear in our communities.""

Attorney General Jeff Sessions told reporters Monday, ""I have seen the Jewish synagogue attacks, threats and things, which is a very serious and disruptive practice. This Department of Justice will do what it can to assist in pushing back against that and prosecuting anybody who was a part of it.""

Goldman said he prayed Sunday evening among the desecrated graves in Philadelphia but remains full of hope. He was joined by members of the community, including Muslims, Christians and a Quaker.

""In the Jewish tradition,"" Goldman said, ""the greatest act of love and kindness one can show is to see to the needs of the dead. It was touching to see all of these people show up to do whatever they could on behalf of those who were laid to rest.""

""It was extremely moving,"" he said. ""Faith amidst the darkness.""

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lines-remember-trumps-joint-address/story?id=45801702,"President Donald Trump offered his vision for the country in his first address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday evening.

Touching on many of the keystones of his presidential campaign, such as immigration from Mexico, national security and job growth, Trump delivered a more optimistic message than he has in other public appearances, notably sticking to his prepared remarks for almost the entirety of the speech.

Here are seven memorable moments from Trump's first joint address:

""Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.""

After facing widespread criticism from Democrats in recent weeks over his perceived silence on threats against the country's Jewish community and an alleged hate crime in Kansas in which a man told two bar patrons to ""get out of my country"" before shooting them and killing one, Trump addressed the incidents at the start of his speech, calling for unity against hate and evil.

""We will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border. As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak and as I promised throughout the campaign.""

Trump returned to one of his original campaign promises, telling Congress that construction on the border wall would begin ""soon."" What Trump did not mention however, is how the wall will be paid for. He consistently told crowds during the campaign that Mexico would foot the bill for the wall, but the country has denied that they will pay. In recent weeks, Trump said that the U.S. may have to pay at first before seeking reimbursement from Mexico.

""My administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe -- and to keep those out who will do us harm.""

The president teased at the issuance of a new executive order limiting travel and immigration into the U.S. After Trump's earlier order blocking entry from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was halted by a federal judge earlier in the month, the White House said that a new order has been ""finalized."" ABC News has learned that the order is expected to be announced Wednesday.

""Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better healthcare.""

Another of Trump's campaign promises, to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- known informally as Obamacare -- made an appearance during the address. On Monday, Trump noted that ""nobody knew that health care could be so complicated,"" as the Republican-controlled house and senate continue to deliberate ways to make changes to the landmark legislation.

""The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.""

In a moment that raised a few eyebrows and produced some laughs on social media, Trump seemed to state the obvious: if health care costs were lowered, it would be easier for more people to acquire.

""We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William 'Ryan' Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero -- battling against terrorism and securing our nation.

I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, 'Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.' Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you.

Ryan is looking down right now and I think he’s very happy because I think he just broke a record.""

The evening's most emotional moment came as Trump introduced the wife of Navy SEAL chief petty officer William ""Ryan"" Owens, who was killed a month ago during a raid in Yemen. While Owens' father has made news in recent days for telling the Miami Herald that he refused to meet with Trump when his son's body was flown back to the U.S., his widow Carryn appeared at the Capitol.

After Trump pushed back on calls for an investigation into the raid by invoking Defense Secretary James Mattis' view of the mission as ""highly successful,"" the body gave Carryn Owens a standing ovation lasting almost two minutes, which the president said he believed ""broke a record.""

""The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams into action.""

Trump concluded his marks with an optimistic message, calling for an end to ""trivial fights."" Many observers noted after the speech that Trump himself seems to revel in those fights and that the White House has instigated many of them.",abcnews.com,True
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-set-make-biggest-speech-joint-address/story?id=45787395,"President Donald Trump delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, addressing a host of familiar themes from his campaign and calling for unity to address a litany of issues that he says are plaguing the country.

Trump's call for an end to the ""pure unadulterated division"" and ""trivial fights"" comes in the wake of a bruising campaign and a tumultuous start to his presidency, squaring off against critics as well as waging a pitched battle against the media. The speech also comes amid a flurry of questions about alleged contacts between Trump associates and suspected Russian officials, which the president has derided as ""fake news.""

""The time for small thinking is over,"" Trump said. ""The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.""

Trump began the address by condemning the recent threats against Jewish centers and a suspected hate crime in Kansas. The president had drawn fire for not immediately addressing the Jewish Community Center incidents and not making public comments about the fatal Kansas shooting until tonight's speech.

""Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms,"" Trump said.

One of the most emotional moments -- and possibly the longest standing ovation of the speech -- came when Trump praised Carryn Owens, the widow of Senior Chief William ""Ryan"" Owens who died in a raid in Yemen. The moment has been a political hot point since Owens' father Bill Owens and Sen. John McCain criticized the president's choice to execute the mission. but Trump used the speech to call it ""a highly successful raid.""

During the speech, Trump revisited what he called the movement that propelled him into the White House.

""In 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet,"" he said. ""The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -– families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns. But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus -- as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.""

""Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people,"" Trump said.

Alex Wong/Getty Images

Trump ran through a series of his biggest campaign promises during much of the speech, giving updates on what he and his team plan to do about them. He talked about how ""we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border,"" and later talked about plans for ""a new program of national rebuilding.""

His call for Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare was met with one of the loudest responses, with Republicans standing while some Democrats were seen giving a thumbs down.

He made a push for unity later in the speech, saying that ""everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.""

""Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more – so why not join forces and finally get the job done? And get it done right. On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people,"" he said.

Trump touched on paid family leave, the need to make childcare more affordable, an effort to promote clean air and water -- all issues that his daughter Ivanka has reportedly championed -- as areas where Republicans and Democrats could work together, along with rebuilding the military and the country's infrastructure.

Alex Wong/Getty Images

He went on to call education ""the civil rights issue of our time"" before asking Congress to fund an education bill that allows children school choice.

""Our children will grow up in a nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind – and the souls – of every American child,"" he said.

While Trump did talk about his administration's plans to build a ""great, great"" wall, a regular theme of his campaign, he did not talk about who would pay for it; he said regularly during the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall and he has since wavered about when and by whom those payments would be made.

First Lady Melania Trump attended the speech along with hand-picked guests, including Maureen Scalia, the widow of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner, who is a senior advisor to the president, were also seated in the first lady's box.

A group of female House Democrats all chose to wear white in an act of support for women's rights. Their sartorial choice was particularly noticeable because they all sat together in the chamber.

On Feb. 22, police in Olathe responded to a 911 call of shots fired at Austin's Bar and Grill, about 20 miles southwest of Kansas City, Kansas, authorities said.

The shooting killed Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, and injured Alok Madasani, 32, and Ian Grillot, 24.

Kuchibhotla died after he was taken to a local hospital, authorities said.

Adam W. Purinton was arrested in the early morning hours on Thursday in Clinton, Missouri, and was being held on $2 million bond. He waived extradition and was transported back to Olathe on Friday.

He has been charged with one count of premeditated murder and two counts of premeditated attempted murder, according to the Johnson County District Attorney's Office.

It was unclear if Purinton had entered a plea. His listed attorney, Johnson County public defender Michelle Durrett, did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

President Trump has not addressed the shooting publicly, but the White House today condemned the shooting.

""It begins to look like this was an act of racially motivated hatred,"" White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said in an off-camera briefing today. ""The president condemns these and any other racially and religiously motivated attacks in the strongest terms. They have no place in our country, and we will continue to make that clear.""

In an interview from his hospital bed, Grillot said he took cover until he thought the shooter's gun was empty.

""I got up and proceeded to chase him down, try to subdue him,"" Grillot said in a video posted online by the University of Kansas Health System. ""I got behind him, and he turned around and fired a round at me.""

Grillot said he was hit in the hand and the chest and the bullet narrowly missed a major artery. A bartender said the shooter used ""racial slurs"" just before firing inside the bar, The Associated Press reported.

ANI/via Reuters TV

Kuchibhotla, who immigrated to the U.S. from India in 2005 and resided in Olathe, worked as an engineer at Garmin. On Friday his wife described him as a hard-working man who loved America and ""did not deserve a death like this.""

Jose Torres, 26, and Kayla Norton, 25, cried today in a Douglas County court as they were sentenced to 20 years and 15 years in prison, respectively.

In July 2015, Torres and Norton, who have three children together, were part of a group of Confederate flag supporters called Respect the Flag. For two days that summer, the group rode around in pickup trucks threatening black families and calling them racial slurs across two counties in the Atlanta suburbs.

The group targeted black families shortly after the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre because its members were upset that the state responded to the brutal slayings by removing the Confederate battle flag from various sites.

At one point, the group pulled up to a birthday party for a black child in Douglasville. The group's members allegedly threatened to kill the partygoers, with Torres confronting the family with a gun that Norton loaded. The family called the police.

Video of the incident was posted on YouTube by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

In an indictment, Torres and Norton, among others, were charged with aggravated assault, terroristic threats and violation of Georgia's Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act.

During their sentencing today, the judge said their actions ""were motivated by racial hatred,"" according to The Associated Press.

Through tears, Norton addressed the relatives of the child whose birthday she and others disrupted.

""That is not me. That is not me. That is not him,"" Norton said in court after her sentencing. ""I would never walk up to you and say those words to you. And I am so sorry that happened to you.""

In addition to Torres and Norton, two people were charged with felonies, according to ABC affiliate WSB-TV.com; the two others pleaded guilty and were sentenced to shorter prison terms.

Ian Grillot, 24, intervened to stop a gunman who witnesses said yelled ""get out of my country"" before shooting two Indian men in Olathe, Kansas last Wednesday, killing one.

Adam Purinton, a 51-year-old Navy veteran and former air traffic controller, is being charged with murder and attempted murder in the shooting that killed Srinivas Kuchibhotla and wounded Alok Madasani, both 32-year-old employees of the technology company Garmin.

Authorities are investigating if the shooting was a hate crime. Purinton is being held on a $2 million bond and is scheduled make his first court appearance on Monday.

“This is a very bad way of it happening, but, I'm so grateful that it is actually bringing the community together instead of driving them apart,"" Grillot said in an interview posted on the University of Kansas Hospital's YouTube page on Sunday. “It is such a beautiful thing. I love it.

“I was more than happy to risk my life to save the lives of others,” Grillot said. “I thank everybody for drawing together and supporting me and the other families affected by this.”

Grillot said he is recovering from gunshot wounds to his hand and chest. He said he was “doing a lot better,” but still sore and feeling the aftermath from “the bullet lodged in my ribs.”

People traveled from as far as India and Washington, D.C. to attend a prayer vigil for Kuchibhotla and the other victims in Olathe on Sunday.

Representative Kevin Yoder (R-Kan) attended the vigil and posted about it on his Instagram account, calling the incident a ""great tragedy"" and saying ""thousands of concerned citizens came together to support one another and the Indian community.""

He also urged people to remember Kuchibhotla’s life as well as Grillot’s “heroism.”

Many of the vigil’s attendees, including Mike Johns of Olathe, said they were there to rally for peace.

“This isn’t Selma, but this is close,” Johns told ABC affiliate KMBC on Sunday. “We’re marching, just like Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] did, for peace.“

Sunayana Dumala said her husband, shooting victim Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, arrived in the U.S. from India in 2005 to pursue a master's degree at the University of Texas at El Paso.

Dumala said not long after that, she and her husband moved to Kansas and ""made Olathe their home,"" and Kuchibhotla continued to ""succeed"" in the aviation industry, which he was passionate about.

On the night of shooting, Kuchibhotla was just doing ""the same thing"" he always does -- enjoying a glass of beer to get rid of his ""work stress"" and have a ""fun time with his friend,"" Dumala said, speaking at a news conference.

According to Dumala, Kuchibhotla and his friends were ""minding their own business"" when a man began harassing them over their race. The managers of the bar kicked the man out, but he came back, Dumala said.

""He has taken a life -- a very lovable soul -- from everyone,"" Dumala said.

The couple's families are ""in grief,"" she said, noting that her husband would have turned 33 on March 9.

Dumala said she had expressed concerns with her husband about shootings in the U.S. and wondered if they should stay in the country.

When she expressed those concerns, she said he would he would tell her, “Good things happen in America.”

Kuchibhotla's brothers also spoke publicly today, urging authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter, which they said they believed was not a random incident.

The Indian government ""should voice out this strongly [to U.S. authorities] because our brothers, sisters and our relatives are there,"" Venu Madhav, a brother of Kuchibhotla, told South Asian news agency Asian News International (ANI) today.

Madhav suggested to ANI that he believed the incident was not just a random shooting, saying, that ""if you really look into this incident, this is not done by a teenager or a burglar, or something like that [or] a drug addict. It is [allegedly] done by a [51-year-old] man.""

Another brother to Kuchibhotla, K.K. Shastri, told ANI that he wants authorities to release Kuchibhotla's body to the family overseas as soon as possible.

""We want the body to be here at the earliest,"" Shastri said. ""We are waiting.""

As the brothers spoke to reporters outside of their home in India, other relatives of Kuchibhotla were seen on video mourning quietly in the home, including one woman who was wiping away tears.

Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies in the U.S. are investigating whether the shooting that left Kuchibhotla dead was a hate crime.

The shooting happened at the Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas, on Wednesday evening, according to authorities.

A bartender said that the shooter used ""racial slurs"" just before firing inside the bar, The Associated Press reported.

The FBI is investigating whether the shooting was a bias crime, according to Kansas City FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Eric Jackson. He said that the FBI was going to investigate ""from every angle to ""determine what the true facts are.""

Local police added that they would also look into whether the shooting was racially motivated.

The shooting killed Kuchibhotla and injured two others -- Alok Madasani, 32, and Ian Grillot, 24, officials said.

Madasani and Grillot were taken to a local hospital where they were listed in stable condition, officials said.

The suspect, Adam W. Purinton, fled after the shooting, according to Olathe Police Chief Steven Menke.

Purinton was found and arrested early the following morning in Clinton, Missouri, and charged with one count of premeditated murder and two counts of premeditated attempted murder, according to Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe.

Purinton is being held on a $2 million bond, Howe said.

Purinton has waived extradition and an attorney has not been formally assigned to Purinton because he has not yet appeared in court, the AP reported today.

The triple-shooting has shaken many, both in the U.S. and in India.

""I am very disturbed by last night's shooting in Olathe,"" Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran said in a statement. ""I strongly condemn violence of any kind, especially if it is motivated by prejudice and xenophobia.""

http://abcnews.go.com/US/fire-florida-mosque-investigated-arson/story?id=45711657,"Officials believe an early morning fire at a mosque in Florida was intentionally set, and the incident is being investigated as a hate crime.

The Hillsbourgh County Fire Rescue received a call around 2:09 a.m. local time Friday about a fire at the Islamic Society of New Tampa in Thonotosassa. Firefighters put out the blaze and no one was hurt, though the building, commonly referred to as the New Tampa Mosque, suffered some property damage, officials said.

Officials and mosque members said it appears someone tried to break into the building. There are marks on the door, which is locked every night when the mosque closes.

Authorities will review footage from surveillance cameras that are installed throughout the property. The investigation is ongoing.

CAIR Florida/Facebook

Officials from CAIR Florida, the state’s largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization, held a news conference with officials outside the mosque this morning. Members of the mosque told reporters they’ve already received incredible support on social media and from the community.

Wilfredo Amr Ruiz, an attorney and the communications director for CAIR Florida, called the fire a “hate crime” and an “act of terror.”

""We congratulate the Hillsborough County first responders for their prompt response to this tragic situation. It is worrisome that our community have fallen victim of what appears to be another hate crime,” Ruiz said in a statement today. “CAIR-Florida urgently call [sic] all local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to be on top of the investigation of what appears to be a heinous act of terror against the Muslim community.”

Due to the ongoing investigation, there will be no Friday prayer at the mosque today. All regular prayers will be held in the old mosque building, according to a press release from the Islamic Society of New Tampa.

The atlas confidence and ATF and Albert county sheriff's office that we will determine what happened here but we do know that it was an arson. And we do know that also foursome was targeted. This is no different than the wave of anti some medic. Attacks on Jewish community centers and synagogues and bomb threats that have been called in all across the country including in Tampa over the recent months. This is a community it celebrates. The diversity of this amazing place. The Pletcher of religions. The gods that we worship this is a community that will never demonize anybody for any reason. And so we stand together as a community.

We will not tolerate this we will stand up in the face of opposition. We will stand up in the face of anybody who we choose to demonize anybody for any reason specifically. And directly. Because of their religion. This is America. Our America their America we don't tolerate that. So whatever occurred here we will find out the perpetrators are will be punished.

We stand in solidarity with all of the members of this community because ultimately they are tea paying its first. They are Americans and as Americans we stand together. So let's figure out who did this but most importantly let's support our Muslim friends and neighbors in this community.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/authorities-investigating-kansas-triple-shooting-hate-crime/story?id=45696597,"Authorities are investigating whether a triple shooting at a Kansas bar, which resulted in one death, was a hate crime.

On Wednesday evening, police responded to a 911 call of shots fired at Austin's Bar and Grill in Olathe, about 20 miles southwest of Kansas City, Kansas, said Olathe Police Chief Steven Menke.

The suspect, Adam W. Purinton, was arrested in the early morning hours on Thursday in Clinton, Missouri, and is being held on $2 million bond, said Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe. Purinton fled the scene of the shooting, according to Menke.

Authorities said the perpetrator of the attack shot Alok Madasani and Srinivas Kuchibhotla, both 32, and Ian Grillot, 24.

All three victims were taken to a local hospital, where Kuchibhotla died, Menke said, adding that authorities have been in contact with all the victims' families. The other two victims are in stable condition, Menke said.

Kuchibhotla worked as an engineer at Garmin.

""I am very disturbed by last night's shooting in Olathe,"" read a statement from Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran. ""I strongly condemn violence of any kind, especially if it is motivated by prejudice and xenophobia.""

Grillot said in an interview from his hospital bed that after the shooting started, he took cover until he thought the shooter's gun was empty.

""I got up and proceeded to chase him down, try to subdue him,"" Grillot said in a video posted online by the University of Kansas Health System. ""I got behind him, and he turned around and fired a round at me.""

Grillot said he was hit in the hand and the chest, and that the bullet narrowly missed a major artery.

""I was told I was incredibly lucky for what happened to me,"" Grillot said. ""I could have never walked again or seen my family again.""

Purinton has been charged with one count of premeditated murder and two counts of premeditated attempted murder, Howe said. It will be up to Clinton County to decide whether to waive extradition, he added.

Howe would not disclose the type of weapon used in the attack, which he described as a ""pretty traumatic event in a very open, public situation.""

It is unclear if Purinton has retained a lawyer.

Patrons were watching a basketball game between the University of Kansas and Texas Christian University before the shooting, which began after 7 p.m., The Associated Press reported.

The FBI is investigating whether the shooting was a bias crime, said Kansas City FBI special agent in charge Eric Jackson. Local police will aid in the investigation.

Jackson said FBI personnel are investigating from every angle to ""determine that the true facts are.""

Authorities were unable to provide further details in the case.

""We've got a lot of work to do,"" Howe said.

He said area residents came together after a similar incident three years ago.

""In these tragic instances, often the community bonds together,"" Howe said. ""I think we'll see this again. I'm very proud of this community.""",abcnews.com,True
