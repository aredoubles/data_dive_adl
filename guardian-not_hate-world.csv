https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/france-election-neofascism-le-pen-macron,"At the university of Paris Nanterre, on the outskirts of the French capital, Antoine Guerreiro of the union of communist students was handing out leaflets urging students to vote for Emmanuel Macron in the final round of the presidential election next Sunday.

Or, to be strictly accurate, to vote against the Front National’s Marine Le Pen. Guerreiro can find very little – if anything – to support in Macron’s programme, but needs must. The alternative is worse.

“On Sunday night, we were all shaken, but now we must carry on without denying our ideals; and one of our strongest ideals is to oppose the far right in all circumstances,” Geurreiro, 19, said. “It’s clear.”

The students are opposing the “ni-ni” (neither-nor) option of abstaining, voting blank or spoiling the ballot paper. Others call it the “ni patrie, ni patron” choice, a rejection of Le Pen’s nationalism and Macron’s support of bankers and bosses.

The leaflet in Guerreiro’s hand said: “After a campaign marked by scandal, neoliberalism and the extreme right … it would be tempting not to turn out for the second round. However, it would not be sensible to let the extreme right run our country.”

The former Socialist mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, told RTL radio he would follow his party’s call to vote for Macron, reminding listeners: “Hitler was elected by universal suffrage. I don’t want to make anyone feel guilty. I’m calling for responsibility, conscience … and generosity. At this given moment we have to put France before our old resentments.”

The conservative Les Républicains party, whose presidential candidate François Fillon was defeated in the first round, has also called for an electoral “barrage” against Le Pen, though some in its traditional Catholic right wing have drifted to the far right.

Even Macron’s arch-nemesis, sheep farmer José Bové, the European ecologist MP and anti-globalisation militant famous for once dismantling a McDonalds restaurant, said he would vote for the En Marche! candidate “without ambiguity or hesitation”. Bové said he had no time for “leftwing purists” like the hard-left firebrand, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. But where was Mélenchon, charismatic leader of La France Insoumise (the France Unbowed) movement? And what would he advise his seven million voters to do?

As the clamour for Mélenchon to speak last week grew, his team said that he was not “a guru” and would not be telling anyone how to vote, while insisting that a vote for Marine Le Pen was “not an option”.

With the question of whether to vote and how causing anguish and anger in equal measure among the hardline French left, for whom Macron is unpalatable and Le Pen beyond the political pale. Jean-Yves Camus, a political analyst with the left-leaning Jean Jaurès foundation and expert on the far right, said waverers needed to be clear in their minds what is at stake.

“This is a choice of civilisation. It’s not a choice between two different programmes or two different political figures. Let’s be completely honest, this is the choice between two kinds of France. That is what’s at stake,” Camus said.

Comparisons with 2002, when the FN founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, knocked out the Socialist party candidate, Lionel Jospin, in the first round of the presidential election, are misleading. The 2002 result was a shock to France and Le Pen himself; he had no credible programme and no real ambition to be president. And in the second round, France voted massively for the conservative Jacques Chirac.

Today no one doubts Marine Le Pen’s will to win. Camus warned that, despite the younger Le Pen’s attempts to clean up the FN’s racist, Holocaust-denying image, the difference between her and her father in political terms was purely cosmetic. “If you listen closely, the words are different, but the policies are the same. Jean-Marie Le Pen said ‘France for the French’, Marine Le Pen says ‘France first’ and her supporters chant: ‘This is our home’,” Camus told a meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association. “We have no choice; we have to stop Le Pen. The spectre of neofascism is still there.”

And he added: “We will probably hear many nasty things in the coming week; nasty stuff about Macron being a former Rothschild banker, for example.”

Harry Bernas, a retired physicist and Mélenchon supporter, said he would be voting Macron because “the danger of abstaining is too great. There is something temporarily irreversible about having Le Pen come to power.

“Thanks to Jean-Luc Mélenchon people have begun thinking there’s another way out of this crisis of poverty, unemployment, despair. The real question is how to vote to keep that going. In my mind it will be easier to continue the fight under Macron than Le Pen, who is more dangerous,” said Bernas.

Joseline Frommer, 68, a former legal assistant and one-time Socialist supporter who also voted for Mélenchon in the first round, admitted she was in the “ni-ni” camp and will vote blank unless the final opinion polls on Friday show that Le Pen could win.

“It’s impossible for me to vote for Le Pen, but a vote for Macron? If I do and he has a huge majority, I think it will make me physically sick. But it’s true, we cannot take the risk of Le Pen winning,” she said.

In Le Monde, Gérard Miller, a psychoanalyst and writer, said Mélenchon supporters like himself were not going to take “moral lessons in anti-fascism”.

“That Macron is today a temporary, very temporary alas, rampart against the Front National, I can admit because I’m going to vote for the leader of En Marche!, but only if we’re going to be lucid: in terms of fighting the far right, nothing, starting with his programme and his past, goes in favour of the former economy minister,” Miller wrote.

Latest polling suggests only 40% of Mélenchon voters will vote for Macron, 45% will abstain, while 15% will vote for Le Pen. On Friday, Mélenchon broke his self-imposed silence to announce he would be voting, but how was between him and the ballot box. This week his campaign team will present the result of a consultation of 450,000 supporters, “Les Insoumis” (the Unbowed), on three choices: to abstain, vote blank or vote for Macron. Mélenchon’s spokesman, Alexis Corbière, said none of the three options for the second round run-off was “immoral”.

Before then, there could be a repeat of last week clashes between police and “anti-fascist” protesters as demonstrators take to the streets across France for the traditional May Day workers’ marches. On Twitter, the #JeVoteMacron (I’m voting Macron) versus the #SansMoiLe7mai (Without me on 7 May), vote or abstain battle continues.

Whatever happens next Sunday, Harry Bernas says the crisis in France is “so bad, so deep and the need for change so great” that the country is at boiling point. “It’s what we physicists call first order transition; when you heat water there’s a change you hardly see just before it turns into vapour, that fluctuation, the agitation around the edge, we’re at that stage, and I think there’s very little chance it will be a subtle, kind or friendly transition.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/29/ms-13-terrifies-long-islands-latinos-and-prompts-a-political-backlash-from-trump,"The town of Central Islip is confronting both the brutal Salvadorean street gang and the fear of sweeping community deportations after a crackdown

The first victims were high school friends Nisa Mickens, 15, and Kayla Cuevas, 16 – killed as they were out on an evening walk last September. A week later, the bodies of Oscar Acosta and Miguel Garcia-Moran, both 19 and missing since the start of the year, were found near an abandoned hospital. Then, this month, four teenage boys were killed close by in a park in Central Islip, a predominantly Latino town on New York’s Long Island, 40 miles east of Manhattan.

In that incident, the killers used machetes or other sharp instruments, their grotesque handiwork betraying the cruelty and ritualism of MS-13, or the Mara Salvatrucha, a neighbourhood street gang with its roots in El Salvador’s civil war of the 80s and 90s.

While no arrests have been made in the most recent murders, police said the victims – Jorge Tigre, 18, Justin Llivicura, 16, Michael Banegas, 18, and Jefferson Villalobos, 18 – were killed in a manner “consistent with the modus operandi” of MS-13.

Now the gang’s trademark brutality and terrifying, heavily tattooed countenances have attracted the attention of US political and law enforcement leadership. On Friday, at Central Islip’s vast federal courthouse, which rises like a white edifice in scrubby woodland five miles from where the murders took place, President Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, restated his commitment to helping the police battle street gangs.

He said the killings were an assault on law and safety, vowed to not let this continue, and blamed “bad guys [that] know how the system works, and they have exploited it”.

Coming on the 100-day mark of the new presidency, Sessions’s comments sought to give flesh and bone to the “bad hombres” of Trump campaign folklore. They could hardly have found a more ferocious-looking group of young men upon which to fix their fear of the outsider.

Indeed, senior administration officials have been outdoing each other with graphic descriptions of a gang that, according to the FBI’s National Gang Intelligence Center, has 30,000 members worldwide and around 10,000 in the US.

The secretary of homeland security, John Kelly, described their supposed role in smuggling immigrants into the US as “a course north that rivals Dante’s journey into hell”.

Kelly was followed by Sessions, who said “depravity and violence are their calling cards”. He was followed by Trump, who added: “They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference ... We are out in Long Island, cleaning out the MS-13 scum.”

Thus, the blue-collar communities of Central Islip and Brentwood – with their brightly decorated Spanish-language restaurants serving Salvadoreans, Guatemalans, Mexicans and other Latino communities – have become the prima facie justification for President Trump’s immigration crackdown.

It is a bitter confluence: a president, so far thwarted in his anti-immigration agenda and now looking to make a mark, coupled with a criminal gang that has spread through poor immigrant communities virtually unimpeded, many say, by law enforcement.

In a recent roundup of 13 suspected MS-13 gang members, seven had entered the US as unaccompanied minors, giving what many fear will be false justification to an administration that has been accused of trying to scapegoat immigrants in the service of a racial agenda.

“These are ugly, brutal events, so for Sessions to come in here to score political points is insulting,” said Foster Maer of campaign group LatinoJustice, who had come to the courthouse with dozens of others to protest at the attorney general’s visit. He accused Sessions of grandstanding for attention and warned that a heavy-handed, poorly targeted crackdown would serve to exacerbate a growing sense of ostracism within immigrant communities.

Maer claimed discrimination had contributed to authorities failing to heed warnings about MS-13 violence or to investigate MS-13-related activity when Latino teens began to disappear last year.

“The failure of local police to welcome the Latino community and gain their trust has created this. Law enforcement put its head in the sand when the murders started a year ago,” Maer said. “They refused to investigate. It wasn’t till two girls disappeared that they started looking.”

The young age of both the victims and perpetrators has added to the growing sense of alarm here.

Prosecutors described the killings of the two teenage girls, Mickens and Cuevas, as a homicidal overreaction to a dispute between pupils and gang members at Brentwood High School a week earlier. The four young men arrested for the girls’ murders, who are aged between 19 and 22, are believed to subsequently have been directed by MS-13 leaders to set on them with baseball bats and machetes.

Evelyn Rodriguez, Cuevas’s mother, said her daughter had been bullied for two years before she was killed. Students at the school, Rodriguez said, “can’t walk the halls without fear”.

Suffolk County’s police commissioner, Timothy Sini, said there was no question that MS-13 was recruiting children who may be unaccompanied or unsupervised. The youngsters “don’t have an established social network, at least many of them don’t, and MS-13 is providing that network,” he said.

According to local community organiser Katie Costanzo, Latino students are more likely to be expelled or suspended, making them easy marks for gang recruiters, who then demand elaborate criminal initiations. “If you’re not in school, you’re going to be on the streets. Who is going to accept you if you are on the streets? The gangs.”

Others fear that law enforcement will crack down on the community, sweeping up undocumented immigrants without effectively targeting the gang members, thereby achieving a political end without solving a crisis of criminality.

“A crackdown is not needed,” said one community organiser who did not wish to be identified. “This is going to be used to justify sweeps and mass deportation.”

MS-13, the community organiser said, were merely perpetuating the customs of extortion they practice in El Salvador and Honduras. Many of the original members of MS-13 were deported from Los Angeles in the 90s, and restored its power base in El Salvador. Authorities believe it is now sending members north to carve out new territory.

“They do what they know. If you’re part of this gang, you’re in it for life. If you come to this country, you have to seek out and find other individuals involved,” said the community organiser. But since the recent murders of the four teenagers, and the subsequent attention from outside the area, he said, “anybody they’re looking for is not here any more. They already left.”

Nonetheless, the political class is gathering with promises of firm action. New York governor Andrew Cuomo, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, also visited the area, promising “undercover work” and an expansion of an anti-gang task force.

Some of the force were in evidence last week, patrolling in unmarked cars, the seriousness of their demeanour contrasting with the vibrancy of the community and the constant musical beats coming out of storefronts. Asked how they planned to tackle MS-13, the black-clad agents in bulletproof vests said simply: “No comment.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/marine-le-pen-putin-trump-axis,"The French presidential hopeful has made no secret of her admiration for Russia’s strongman leader, but her relationship with Trump is less clearcut

The week after Donald Trump won the US presidential election last November, Marine Le Pen was inaugurating the headquarters of her own election campaign in Paris, less than a mile from the Elysée Palace she hopes to move into soon.

The far-right, anti-immigration Front National leader had been the only French political leader to back Trump in his bid for the White House. She has also made no secret of her admiration for Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin.

Unveiling her campaign symbol, a blue rose, she said that her election as France’s president would form a trio of world leaders that “will be good for world peace”, leading “a worldwide movement that rejects unchecked globalisation, destructive ultra-liberalism, the elimination of nation states, the disappearance of borders”.

Last month, Le Pen was in Moscow for a personal audience with Putin. “A new world has emerged in these past years,” she said. “It’s the world of Vladimir Putin, it’s the world of Donald Trump in the US. I share with these great nations a vision of cooperation, not of submission.”

Clearly, there is ideological common ground between the three leaders: variations on a theme of nation-first politics, support for economic protectionism and immigration controls, mistrust of international alliances and institutions such as Nato or the EU, and a rejection of globalism and the liberal consensus.

But Le Pen’s actual ties with the two leaders differ significantly. With Russia, at least, they go beyond the ideological to the personal and the practical. Her meeting with Putin in March was reported to be their first; but according to French investigative journalists, it is possibly their third.

Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father and an admirer of authoritarianism and ultra-nationalism, told the BBC in an interview recorded before last month that his daughter had previously met the Russian president, and her former foreign affairs adviser Aymeric Chauprade said in 2014 unofficial talks had taken place.

Unless she thinks media attention will serve her, Le Pen’s trips abroad are often conducted discreetly. She has, though, visited Russia in 2011 – when she told the daily Kommersant: “I won’t hide that, in a certain sense, I admire Vladimir Putin” – and in June 2013 and April 2014.

Front National aides and MEPs have been to Moscow far more often – and two ruling-party Russian MPs were honoured guests at the 2014 party conference that re-elected Le Pen party leader with a 100% mandate.

Putin welcomes Le Pen to Moscow with a nudge and a wink Read more

In further shows of sympathy, Le Pen has called for “completely stupid” EU sanctions against Russia to be lifted, said there was “no invasion” of Crimea because it had “always been Russian”, and argued Ukraine had undergone “a coup d’état”.

Nor has the party been shy about accepting Russian money, on the grounds that no French bank will lend to it. The party borrowed €9m in 2014 from the First Czech Russian Bank (which later lost its licence) and acknowledged seeking €3m from Russia’s Strategy bank in 2016.

The FN has always denied the Russian loans had bought Moscow any influence with the party. Le Pen told Le Monde the suggestion was “ridiculous” and “outrageous”, adding: “So because we get a loan, that dictates our foreign policy? We’ve held this [pro-Russian] line for a long time.”

There seems little doubt that for its part, Russia is attempting to influence the outcome of France’s presidential election, whose final round on 7 May will pit Le Pen against the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron. Current polls suggest she will lose.

Japanese cyber-security group Trend Micro said in a 41-page report this week that the Russian hackers known as Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear or APT28 – thought by US spy agencies and private cyber-security firms to be an arm of Russian intelligence – had targeted Macron’s En Marche! using exactly the same tactics employed against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the operation which US authorities believe helped sway the election in Trump’s favour.

Emmanuel Macron’s campaign team bans Russian news outlets from events Read more

Macron’s campaign team confirmed they had been the target of at least five sophisticated cyber-attacks since January aimed at accessing sensitive data. “Emmanuel Macron is the only candidate in the French presidential campaign to be targeted,” the campaign said in a statement. “It’s no coincidence.”

Le Pen’s relations with Trump are less clearcut. She has said she would have voted for him if she could, and he has come close to endorsing her, telling AP on the eve of the first round that the far-right leader was “the strongest on borders, and the strongest on what’s been going on in France”.

In January, Le Pen was photographed drinking coffee in Trump Tower with her partner, the party’s vice-president Louis Aliot, and Guido “George” Lombardi, a businessman neighbour of Trump’s who has portrayed himself as a kind of European far-right fixer for the president.

Lombardi was known to have held a fundraising party for the Front National the previous evening, and most of the efforts by Le Pen’s entourage in the US are so far believed to have been directed towards securing much-needed contributions to party funds.

But Trump and Le Pen did not meet, staff from both sides have insisted. Nor did the Front National’s European affairs adviser, Ludovic de Danne, or its US representative, Denis Franceskin, get to see Trump in November, when Lombardi invited them to Trump Tower for the election night party.

The FN representatives were told the president-elect did not have security clearance to come down to the lobby. But in pre-election remarks to the Hollywood Reporter, Trump said there was “no common ground to be explored” with Europe’s far right and he did not want to “establish alliances beyond the Atlantic”.

Some of his backers are less reticent. Le Pen has met leading Trump supporters including congressman Steve King, a Republican from Iowa who has courted controversy for making incendiary comments about immigrants.

And while Steve Bannon’s star may now be waning, the former Breitbart CEO and Trump’s chief strategist has made no secret of his admiration for the French far right.

Bannon told French website Radio Londres last summer that he saw Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, Le Pen’s niece, as “the new rising star”, and predicted France’s 2017 elections would be “historic”. Maréchal-Le Pen has praised “alternative media” and said she would be delighted to work with Breitbart if it opened a Paris bureau, as it has promised – but so far failed – to do.

Le Pen's replacement steps down after allegedly casting doubt on Nazi gas chambers Read more

Bannon has also drawn inspiration from some of the Front National’s favourite literature, including the works of Charles Maurras, a far-right Catholic theorist seen as the founding father of French ultra-nationalism, and Jean Raspail, author of The Camp of the Saints, a highly controversial 1973 novel depicting a France submerged by immigration and often described as racist.

The far-right candidate is also backed by a ruthless, highly organised and very popular web and social media campaign that echoes the successful online agitprop techniques used by Trump’s “alt-right” supporters during the US presidential campaign. US-based far-right internet warriors are reportedly helping out by pretending to be French.

Le Pen herself, however, seems to think that if the Trump-Le Pen nexus is an inspiration for anyone, it is for the US president.

“I do not take Trump as a model,” she told La Voix du Nord newspaper in January. “He is the one who is applying what I have been proposing for years.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/29/trump-blames-constitution-for-first-100-days-chaos-presidency,"On his 100th day in office on Saturday, facing historically low popularity ratings, a succession of intractable foreign crises and multiple investigations of his links with Moscow, Donald Trump reminded the nation that 1 May was Loyalty Day.

The day is a US tradition dating back to the cold war, when it was a bolster to stop May Day becoming a rallying point for socialists and unionised workers, but for an embattled president learning politics on the job it has an added resonance.

In an interview with Fox News to mark the 100-day mark, he declared himself “disappointed” with congressional Republicans, despite his many “great relationships” with them.

He blamed the constitutional checks and balances built in to US governance. “It’s a very rough system,” he said. “It’s an archaic system … It’s really a bad thing for the country.”

The Loyalty Day announcement came amid a flurry of other proclamations to mark the milestone at which the early stages of American presidencies are traditionally measured. The coming seven days were named both National Charter Schools Week and Small Business Week. May has been burdened with being simultaneously: National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, Older Americans Month, Jewish American Heritage Month, National Foster Care Month, as well as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

Such announcements help a president look busy, especially at such heavily scrutinised milestones as the 100-day mark, and particularly for an inexperienced politician rapidly learning the limits of presidential power, even with a solid Republican majority in Congress.

He has failed to get any of his priorities turned into legislation in the face of party disunity, and his attempt to rule by executive order has been largely hollow. His decrees have been either meaningless, like his one-page, detail-free tax reform plan, or have been blocked by the courts, such as his travel ban for Muslim countries and refugees.

Trump’s approval ratings have remained mired at historic lows for a presidency in what is supposed to be a honeymoon period, hovering around – and frequently below – the 40% mark, well below his recent predecessors at this stage in their presidencies.

But his core supporters have remained faithful, choosing to believe that the mainstream media are purveyors of fake news, rather than accept that the Trump presidency has not been the unrivalled success the president has claimed. They have also accommodated Trump’s affinity for Vladimir Putin. The percentage of Republicans who see Russia as an unfriendly state has fallen from 82% in 2014 to 41% now, according to a CNN/ORC poll.

On his 100th day, Trump turned to this loyal base to sound off on the issue that bonds them most tightly – economic nationalism. On an otherwise leisurely Saturday, during which his only other engagement was a call with the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, the president was due to attend an evening rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where disenchanted workers defected from the Democrats in droves in the 2016 election. While visiting the town, he was also due to sign an executive order to establish an office of trade and manufacturing policy, which will help push his drive for import substitution.

In his weekly presidential address, he also focused on jobs, pointing to evidence of an economic revival that has been previously contested as a result of corporate decisions made before Trump came to office. He claimed that car companies were “roaring back in”, an apparent reference to General Motors’ plans and Ford’s decision to expand in Michigan, which both appeared to be part of their long-term strategy.

Trump also claimed that his approval of the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada would create tens of thousands of jobs. That will be true in the short term, during the construction phase, but after that keeping the pipeline going is expected to employ 35 people on a permanent basis.

The gap between the extreme bravado of Trump’s claims and the daily realities of governing has deepened public cynicism. In a new Gallup poll, just 36% declared him honest and trustworthy, down from 42% in early February. His general approval rating stood at 40%.

There is strong evidence, however, that the fact-checking of presidential claims is having a small and dwindling impact on true Trump loyalists. His support remains strong in traditional blue collar areas and evangelical strongholds, where there is more trust in the president than the mainstream media. The president has relentlessly assaulted the media, launching an attack per day on average since he took office, denouncing negative news as fake news, and there are signs the relentless offensive has inflicted wounds. One poll released on Friday found that more people trusted the White House than political journalists.

Against that background there were reports yesterday that Steve Bannon, the champion of economic and ethnic nationalism, was making a political comeback in the White House, and that he remained a bulwark of Trump’s strategy to secure his core support and win again in 2020.

His hand has been seen behind the rapid-burst issue of protectionist moves in the run up to the 100th day, picking fights with Canada over milk and softwood imports, and measures to shield the aluminium industry from foreign competition.

“All of these people who say the president doesn’t have an ideology, they’re wrong,” one unnamed Bannon ally told political news site The Hill. “He does have an ideology, and it’s Bannon’s ideology. They are just now figuring out how to implement it.”

Bannon was also said to have drafted an executive order withdrawing the US from the North American Free Trade Area (Nafta), but on Thursday Trump decided simply to issue a call for its renegotiation reportedly after having been shown a map showing it would cost the most jobs in states that had supported him in the election. The battle between countervailing factions in the Trump White House continues to ebb and flow, but the president’s reflexes in times of adversity lead him to fall back on the “America First” narrative that got him elected in the first place.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/turkey-blocks-wikipedia-under-law-designed-to-protect-national-security,"Turkey has blocked Wikipedia, the country’s telecommunications watchdog has said, citing a law that allows it to ban access to websites deemed obscene or a threat to national security.

The move is likely to further worry rights groups and Turkey’s western allies, who say Ankara has curtailed freedom of speech and other basic rights in the crackdown that followed last year’s failed coup.

“After technical analysis and legal consideration … an administrative measure has been taken for this website,” the BTK telecoms authority said in a statement on its website.

Turkey arrests 1,000 and suspends 9,100 police in new crackdown Read more

It cited a law that allows it to block access to individual web pages or entire sites for the protection of public order, national security or the wellbeing of the public.

BTK is required to submit such measures to a court within 24 hours. The court then has two days to decide if the ban should be upheld.



A block on all language editions of the online encyclopaedia was detected at 5am GMT on Saturday, monitoring group Turkey Blocks said on its website.

“The loss of availability is consistent with internet filters used to censor content in the country,” it said.

When attempting to access the webpage using Turkish internet providers, users received a notice that the site could not be reached and a “connection timed out” error.

Monitoring groups have accused Turkey of blocking access to social media sites such as Twitter or Facebook, particularly in the aftermath of militant attacks.

The government has in the past denied doing so, blaming the blackouts on spikes in usage after major events.

Technical experts at watchdog groups, however, say they are intentional, aimed in part at stopping the spread of militant images and propaganda.

Later on Saturday, Turkish authorities said they had expelled more than 3,900 people employed by the civil service, military and gendarmerie.

The move, reported in the government’s official gazette, appears to be the latest large-scale purge related to last year’s failed coup.

The expelled included prison guards, clerks, academics, and employees of the religious affairs ministry, all of whom were suspected of links to “terrorist organisations and structures presenting a threat to national security”, the government said.

It is the second large-scale purge since the narrow victory of an 16 April referendum giving Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, sweeping powers.

On Wednesday more than 9,000 police personnel were suspended and another 1,000 detained for alleged links to the network of the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, whom Ankara blames for the failed coup.

Also suspended were 1,127 employees of the justice ministry – including prison guards and clerks – plus 484 academics, and 201 employees from the religious affairs directorate, the government said on Saturday.

About 120,000 people have already been suspended from jobs ranging from the civil service to the private sector, and more than 40,000 arrested, following last year’s failed coup.

Mass detentions immediately after the attempted coup were supported by many Turks, who agreed with Erdoğan when he blamed Gülen for orchestrating the putsch – which killed 240 people, mostly civilians. But criticism mounted as the arrests widened.

Relatives of those detained or sacked since July say they have nothing to do with the armed attempt to overthrow the government, and are victims of a purge designed to solidify Erdoğan’s control.

Turkey also banned hugely popular television dating shows, a move that been mooted for months by the government.

“In radio and television broadcasting services, such programmes in which people are introduced to find a friend.... cannot be permitted,” said the text of the decree.

Deputy prime minister Numan Kurtulmus said in March that the ban was in the pipeline, arguing the shows do not fit in with Turkish traditions and customs.

“There are some strange programmes that would scrap the institution of family, take away its nobility and sanctity,” Kurtulmus said at the time.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/acid-attacks-italy-gessica-notaro,"Gessica Notaro has become the face of a campaign to end violence against women

On the sixth anniversary of her brother’s suicide, Gessica Notaro, a dolphin trainer and former Miss Italy finalist, thought that she would die too.

As she returned home from dinner with friends on 10 January, the 28-year-old had acid thrown in her face, allegedly by her ex-boyfriend Jorge Edson Tavares, 29.

The attack left her badly disfigured and almost blind in one eye, and Notaro claims her attacker picked the date on purpose. “He was well aware that it was the anniversary of my brother’s death,” she told the Observer at her home in Rimini, on Italy’s Adriatic coast.

Tavares, with whom she lived for three years, is in custody but denies any involvement. Notaro appeared in court for the trial of her ex-boyfriend on charges of stalking last week.

She revealed her horrific injuries for the first time when she appeared on Italy’s Maurizio Constanzo chatshow, and told viewers: “I want you to see what he did to me. This isn’t love.”

The case has captured the public’s attention in a country where attacks involving cheap and easily obtainable corrosive liquids are on the rise. There were 27 registered assaults in 2016, compared with eight in 2013, according to data provided by police to SOS Stalking, an organisation set up to support the victims of harassment.

This figure may pale in comparison with England, where in London alone there were 454 such attacks last year. But within the context of Italy’s high rate of femicide – 116 women were killed by their partners or ex-partners between January and November last year, according to figures from the national statistics agency – the phenomenon is worrying.

“England is quite different from Italy in that many of the cases there are between gangs of men,” said Lorenzo Puglisi, a lawyer and founder of SOS Stalking. “But here some 90% of acid attacks are against women by former boyfriends who can’t accept that the relationship is over. Acid is their most destructive tool, a way of saying ‘If I can’t have you, then nobody else can either’. It’s partly a cultural problem because many people still see women as objects to be owned by men.”

Notaro, who was crowned beauty queen of the Emilia-Romagna region in 2007 before going on to reach the finals of the Miss Italy beauty contest, fell in love with Tavares when mutual friends brought him to a gathering at her home in 2013.

Tavares, whom she described as being the perfect gentleman, asked her mother’s permission before he moved in with her a week later. “He had a strong, stubborn character, and we argued like any normal couple, but he was never aggressive towards me while we were together,” she said.

Notaro, who found Tavares a job alongside her at Rimini’s dolphinarium, said the trouble began last August, when she turned down his marriage proposal and ended the relationship.

He then allegedly began a campaign of harassment, bombarding her with phone calls, text messages and following her every movement during a six-month period, which brought on severe panic attacks. She claims he staged a fake suicide outside her home in order to get her sympathy.

“I had anxiety before due to losing both my brother and my father, but during this period I was living a nightmare,” she said.

Notaro reported the harassment to police and Tavares was eventually given a restraining order after he allegedly threatened to destroy her life. Fearing acid might be his weapon of choice, she kept a helmet in her car to wear on the short walk between the car park and her home whenever she returned after dark. On the night of the attack, she didn’t have it with her.

Tavares allegedly pounced, pouring an entire bottle over her, as she opened the car door to get her bag.

“My first thought was, ‘My God, he actually did it’. I expected it but still couldn’t believe it had happened.”

As her face started burning and the reality of the horrifying ordeal set in, the thing she feared most was losing her sight. “I started to pray – if I survive, take away my beauty, but please not my eyes. What would I do without my eyes?”

Notaro, who has also worked as a TV presenter, singer and dancer, spent two months in hospital and underwent several operations, including one to save the sight in her left eye.

She has to wait a year before she can begin reconstructive surgery. Meanwhile, she takes a cocktail of medication almost every hour, including eye drops and creams to ease the pain. She has difficulty sleeping, as she is unable to close her eyes, and struggles with eating and speaking.

The high-profile case is similar to that of Lucia Annibali, a lawyer whose face was left badly corroded after her former boyfriend, Luca Varani, hired two men to douse her with sulphuric acid as she returned home one night in 2013. Varani, also a lawyer, was sentenced to 20 years in prison a year later.

Tavares faces up to 12 years if charged and found guilty of causing serious injuries, said Puglisi. That would be on top of a conviction for stalking.

Italy introduced laws in 2013 to crack down on violence against women after being shamed by a UN report, which said domestic violence was the country’s “most pervasive form of violence”.

“In recent years police have increased their knowledge about acid attacks, so we now have agents who are equipped to deal with cases,” said Puglisi.

“The problem is we don’t have the budget to prevent this kind of crime. In Britain, GPS is used to track stalkers. In Italy, we’re testing GPS but it’s not being used as it should be because we don’t have the money. This is a very big issue, because using this kind of thing could cut this type of crime by half – in the case of Notaro, this could have been the solution had the man in jail been tracked.”

Annibali, whose face was reconstructed after almost 20 operations, has become the symbol in the campaign to stop violence against women, a role Notaro, who was visited by Italy’s justice minister, Andrea Orlando, last week, is starting to take on herself.

Since the attack, she has been inundated with messages from other victims of stalking and abuse seeking support. “Even after everything, I still have my strong character,” she said.

“And now I feel useful in helping other people. I will continue to campaign, which I know in itself will be a challenge – but after having acid thrown in my face, very few things frighten me now.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/fadwa-barghouti-interview-prison-hunger-strike,"Not long before Marwan Barghouti, the imprisoned leader of Fatah, called the largest hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners in recent years, his wife, Fadwa, and daughter Ruba visited him in Hadarim prison, Israel.

“The last time I went to visit him with my daughter was two to three months ago,” recalled Fadwa last week on the 11th day of the strike. “My daughter said to him, ‘I wish you wouldn’t do this. We don’t see you very often. My brothers don’t see you. We will worry about you and not be able to visit.’ He replied: ‘I know it’s going to be painful for the family’.”

Two weeks since it began, the strike by more than 1,000 prisoners in Israeli jails is galvanising Palestinian opinion. On Thursday, the day The Observer spoke to Fadwa in Ramallah, a general strike in support of the prisoners had shuttered shops, offices and schools. Roads were blocked by barricades and there were new posters in the city, depicting the prisoners.

The hunger strike is taking place against a background of rising tension before the 50th anniversary in June of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories, not just between Palestinians and Israelis, but between the main Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas.

At its centre is Barghouti, 57, who is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2004 by an Israeli court of five counts of murder for his role in directing attacks against Israelis during the second intifada, which took place between 2000 and 2005. As the strike began, he was moved from Hadarim into solitary confinement in a prison near Haifa.

Barghouti’s supporters insist the strike is about prisoner rights, not his political ambitions. But inevitably the question of how he is seen – and what he represents – has come to dominate.

In the rhetoric of right-wing Israeli ministers and commentators, Barghouti is a “murderer and terrorist” who some say should have been executed. To many Palestinians he is a hero, sometimes compared to Nelson Mandela, and a figure untainted by the corruption and political machinations that have been a hallmark of the era of the ageing Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.

In her office, hung with pictures of her husband, the strain is beginning to show on Fadwa. With little information from the Israeli prison service, and no access, what news she has comes from other prisoners who have seen her husband and managed to pass back a few details.

Some reports say the strike is already exacting a heavy toll on its participants, who are taking only water and salt, although none so far have suffered serious health problems. “The next days will be hard,” said Fadwa. “The last time I saw him was two weeks before the strike. Since the first day no one has been able visit him. All the information I have is unofficial. Some of the prisoners are suffering and it is getting worse.”

Palestinian hunger strikers' leader moved to solitary confinement Read more

Fadwa said the strikers drew up a list of demands eight months ago, about prison conditions, including visits, access to phones, education and health screening. “They sent letters to the Palestinian leadership saying if Israel did not comply by 16 April the strike would begin, telling the Palestinian Authority that they could help prevent it by putting pressure on the Israelis.”

Even if there have been contacts behind the scenes, it appears there has been no negotiation. Instead Israel has increased pressure on the strikers by cutting them off from the outside world. Supporters say radios have been confiscated and access to lawyers ended. Issa Qaraqe, head of prisoners affairs for the Palestinian Authority, said the leaders have been confined in solitary, and others have been moved to special wings. “They have set up collective confinement sections where hunger strikers have been put with only the clothes they are wearing, mattresses and toothpaste, with personal belongings confiscated.”

Of more concern to Qaraqe and Fadwa has been comments by some Israeli ministers, including the combative intelligence minister Israel Katz, who said Barghouti should have been executed. “When a despicable murderer like Barghouti protests in prison for improved conditions, while the relatives of those he murdered are still in pain, there is only one solution – death penalty for terrorists,” said Katz at the beginning of the protest.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Barghouti as an “arch-terrorist” while the defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, suggested Israel should take the approach of Margaret Thatcher towards the IRA hunger strikers in 1981 and allow them to die.

Describing the Israeli response as “incitement and provocation”, Qaraqe said: “These statements – accompanied by the extreme measures against the hunger strikers – aggravate the situation. This strike did not come out of a vacuum. It came out of the failure to discuss the issues with the Israeli prison authorities … Israel brought the situation to this level.” Beyond the prison walls, the scale of the strike has created problems for all sides. Israeli authorities have previously negotiated with hunger strikers, and their intransigent language has raised tensions. And while senior Palestinian figures, including Abbas, offer vocal support, the timing of the strike – before next week’s meeting between Abbas and Donald Trump in Washington – is clearly troubling them. The result is a complicated balancing act for the Palestinian leadership – lending support while instructing their security services to prevent clashes with Israelis at checkpoints during demonstrations supporting the strike. This underscores the view that Barghouti has limited control of the situation.

That he should be at the forefront, even in prison, is hardly surprising to long-time observers. Speaking to this writer three years ago, former Israeli peace negotiator Yossi Beilin, who knew Barghouti, presciently flagged up the challenge that he posed. Inside or outside jail, Barghouti remains one of the most important Palestinian leaders. “I am not an admirer,” Beilin said then. “He is shrewd. A street cat. He is a proud Palestinian, proud of his movement. I saw him [during the Oslo peace talks] as a partner. Someone committed to a political solution.

“He is a politician and a statesman. Like other politicians who have been involved with violence, we have somehow to find a way of dealing with him in a political framework … because he can lead those who follow him to an agreement.”

That “shrewdness” is evident in the hunger strike, and not only its timing ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Israeli occupation. The demands for better prisoner conditions, low key as they are, seem designed to be – in theory at least – achievable.

The question now is whether Barghouti’s well-attested influence and charisma is such that he can lead, even sequestered in solitary confinement.

For Israel, if the protest continues, the choices do not appear good, with security officials aware that dead hunger strikers would risk an upsurge in violence. Force-feeding too, although permitted in Israel following a supreme court ruling last year, is also deeply contentious, with the Israeli Medical Association opposed.

In her office, Fadwa is suddenly tearful, contemplating where the hunger strike will lead: “An element that makes it harder is that I feel other families want to draw strength from me, so I need to hide my feelings,” she said, adding that the strike had made her realise how much her husband had been absent from his family – in prison, wanted, or deported. “I used to blame Marwan for not being there. He said you have to bear with me. It is the struggle for a better life for our children. Now it has been 30 years.”

It is also clear that the absence of any dialogue does not bode well for the health of the strikers. Asked about the risks, she says only: “God will protect him.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/cuba-military-plane-crash-artemisa-eight-dead,"Soviet-made plane crashed into hillside on Saturday morning in the western province of Artemisa, government says

A Cuban military plane crashed into a hillside on Saturday morning in the western province of Artemisa, killing eight troops on board, the government said.

In a written statement, the ministry of the revolutionary armed forces said the Soviet-made, twin-engined turboprop Antonov AN-26 took off from the Playa Baracoa airport outside Havana at 6.38am and crashed into a hillside outside the town of Candelaria about 40 miles away.

“The eight military personnel on board, including the crew, died,” the statement published by state-run media said. “A commission … is investigating the causes of the accident.”

Officials did not immediately release any further information.

The majority of planes flown in Cuba were produced in the Soviet Union. Antonov produced the AN-26 planes in Kiev between 1969 and 1986.

The last major plane crash in Cuba was an Aero Caribbean flight that went down in flames in 2010, killing all 68 people aboard. That plane was a European-manufactured ATR-72-212.",guardian.com,False

The US Environmental Protection Agency’s main climate change website is “undergoing changes” to better reflect “the agency’s new direction” under Donald Trump.

The American people – not Big Oil – must decide our climate future | Senator Bernie Sanders and Mark Jacobson Read more

The announcement, made late Friday evening, left empty what was previously the “official government site” providing “comprehensive information on the issue of climate change and global warming”.

The change came a day before thousands gathered in Washington DC and other US cities to protest inaction on climate change, and hours before the symbolic 100-day mark of the Trump administration.

At the marquee climate protest, the Peoples Climate March in Washington, tens of thousands made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue in sweltering heat on their way to encircle the White House.

Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco. In Chicago, marchers headed from the city’s federal plaza to Trump Tower. In Denver, marchers were met with a dose of spring snow.

Some of the marches drew celebrity attendees, including former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the capital and senator and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders at an event in Montpelier, Vermont.

“Honored to join Indigenous leaders and native peoples as they fight for climate justice,” DiCaprio tweeted.

Any marchers who used their phones to look at the EPA climate change website would have been greeted with a message from the new administration: “This page is being updated.”

“As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,” said JP Freire, an associate administrator for public affairs.

Previously, the website housed data on greenhouse gas emissions from large polluters and reports on the effects of climate change and its impact on human health.

“We want to eliminate confusion,” Freire said, “by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we’re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law.”

The Trump administration has called for budget cuts of nearly one-third at the EPA and has sought to weaken protections for human health. For instance, the White House has proposed cutting funding and regulations regarding lead poisoning prevention and is considering rewriting regulations concerning smog.

It has already rolled back a law that prevented coal mining companies from dumping waste in streams.

In an op-ed piece for the Guardian published on Saturday, Sanders made an economic case for a focus on industries meant to ameliorate the effects of climate change, rather than those which contribute to it.

The senator from Vermont wrote: “No matter what agenda President Trump and his administration of climate deniers push, it is clear that jobs in clean energy like wind and solar are growing much more rapidly than jobs in the coal, oil and gas sectors.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/alexei-navalny-on-putins-russia-all-autocratic-regimes-come-to-an-end,"Vladimir Putin is riding high, expecting a fourth term as president and allegedly influencing elections from the US to France – but Alexei Navalny is determined to stop him

Alexei Navalny is in good spirits for a man who can hardly step outside without being insulted, assaulted or arrested. Earlier this month he was released from a 15-day stint in a Russian jail. And on Thursday, in Moscow, unknown assailants threw green dye in his face, the second such attack in recent months. But his habitual half-smirk never seems to waver.

Perhaps it is because, as Vladimir Putin prepares to stand for yet another presidential term in elections next March, Navalny is threatening to bring some life to the arid landscape that is Russian politics. Navalny was imprisoned because of a protest he called for on 26 March. It surprised everyone with its size. In Moscow alone, police detained more than 1,000 people, and jailed dozens. Although the numbers were small in absolute terms, people protested in dozens of towns across Russia, marking a worrying new development for the Kremlin.

For Navalny, the fortnight behind bars seems to have been an energising rather than a demoralising experience. “There were some others in the jail, and for all of them it was their first protest in their lives,” says Navalny when I meet him in his office in a Moscow business centre. “When they saw me walking past, they were calling out, ‘When’s the next protest?’ They weren’t asking if there would be one, they wanted to know when.”

Navalny, 40, is a lawyer-turned- campaigner whose Anti-Corruption Foundation carries out investigations into the wealth of Putin’s inner circle. After some years when he was on the fringes of liberal politics but known for his Russian nationalist views, Navalny emerged as the main opposition leader in the wave of protests that accompanied the build-up to the last Russian presidential election, in 2012.

The day he was arrested, security agents showed up at his office, packed up all the electronics and walked off with them. When I visit, nothing has yet been returned. He is working on a MacBook with a sticker on it bearing the three-letter Russian word “VOR”, meaning “thief”. A grotesque caricature of Putin’s face peers at me through the O.

Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov looks down at us from a calendar released by the foundation, listing its key investigations. In 2015, Navalny alleged that Peskov had spent his honeymoon on one of the world’s most expensive sailing boats, and spotted him wearing a limited-edition watch worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. (Peskov denied the boat trip and said the watch was a wedding gift.) Navalny has also accused deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov’s wife of using a private jet to fly her pet corgis around Europe, and obtained drone footage of the palatial residences of other ministers and top officials.

Navalny’s most recent investigation was into the prime minister and one-time placeholder president, Dmitry Medvedev, alleging that the man who was once heralded as the beginning of a new liberal era for Russia in fact controlled an empire of luxury residences, vineyards and yachts. “It really pissed people off,” says Navalny. It was the Medvedev investigation that brought people to the streets in March. “Everyone already thought Medvedev was pathetic and pointless, but it turns out he’s pathetic, pointless and a billionaire.”

Medvedev dismissed the allegations as “lies” from a “political imposter”. But even though state television has ignored the allegations, nearly 20 million people have viewed Navalny’s YouTube video. Navalny believes that as poverty continues to blight large swaths of Russia’s population, the mood of protest will only grow. Even the police are angry about government corruption, Navalny claims.

“The cops who arrest me” – Navalny has been detained or arrested multiple times – “always say: ‘We support you, you’re a good guy, we’ve seen the films, Medvedev is taking the fucking piss, but Putin’s foreign policy is great. Of course, the internal policies aren’t so good.’” This chimes with what I have heard on my trips around Russia: people are miserable about their own situations, but believe Putin’s interventions in Ukraine and Syria have saved the world from US hegemony.

And these days it’s not just in Russia that Putin is seen as all-powerful. I ask Navalny about the current alarm over Kremlin interference in the west. He chuckles at the idea that Donald Trump is somehow a “Russian agent” and thinks the west has become hysterical about Russia, but he also says it’s clear the Kremlin will attempt to buy influence where it can, and thinks western politicians come surprisingly cheap.

“For these guys, a billion dollars is nothing,” he says, cocking his head towards the calendar featuring Putin’s inner circle. “And for just a billion dollars you can buy up all the small parties of Europe.”

Navalny says he does his best to counter TV propaganda about renewed Russian influence when campaigning in the regions. “I tell them: ‘OK great, so Putin is promising to rebuild Palmyra, but why don’t you look at the roads in your city? What do you think the priority should be? Fixing the roads in Voronezh or Stavropol or rebuilding Palmyra? The Americans are loaded. Let them fix Palmyra, and we should concentrate on our own problems.’”

A few days later, I meet Navalny again in Chelyabinsk, a two-hour flight east of Moscow. It is one stop on a tour of dozens of cities that he has undertaken ahead of standing in the March presidential 2018 election. An industrial city with a population of just over a million, Chelyabinsk is filled with decaying, Soviet-era factories that emit so much pollution that when you inhale, the air stings the back of the nostrils like wasabi. It’s a Putin heartland, but also the kind of place where the economic hardships of the last few years have been felt most acutely. Navalny and his team arrive late at night, after a bone-crunching six-hour drive from Tyumen, where he opened a campaign headquarters the day before.

In other towns on the campaign trail, he has been assaulted or insulted as he tries to meet with locals. Bomb threats are phoned into venues where he is speaking, leading to the police evacuating them. In Chelyabinsk, the day passes relatively peacefully. In the morning, he speaks to young locals who want to volunteer to help get his presidential campaign underway. There are a couple of hundred people there, many from the city’s nascent hipster class. It’s an impressive turnout, but these people are Navalny’s natural support base. More interesting is how his message goes down later in the day, when he speaks at an environmental protest, against the construction of a new mining and processing plant that will pollute the atmosphere even more.

The local authorities take no chances with their inconvenient guest from the capital. The children’s playground where the rally takes place is surrounded by five police buses, a detachment of riot police in cosmonaut helmets, a bevy of Cossacks who look ready for a fight, and some brawny youths who have shown up, almost certainly on the orders of the authorities, to disrupt proceedings.

“This is an environmental gathering, please behave in a dignified manner,” pleads the frazzled organiser, as 50 or so people begin chants of “Go away!” and “Shame!” the minute Navalny’s name is mentioned.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Navalny after having green dye thrown in his face, the second such attack he has suffered this year. Photograph: Twitter

He takes the stage with a grin. “Let me explain something to you – I’ve got a microphone and you haven’t, so this is all a bit pointless,” he shouts jovially, as the young men keep chanting. “But look, if you don’t like me, don’t vote for me. I’ve come today, and I’ll be leaving this evening. But the plant will stay here, and it’s going to poison you, and your families. Is that what you want? Keep chanting if that’s what you really want.” The provocateurs, extraordinarily, pipe down. Some of them even look a bit ashamed, and listen as Navalny launches into a characteristic rant about Putin’s “crooks and thieves” who are stealing their money and poisoning their cities.

Russia is a country where politicians rarely have to do anything as risky as meeting with real people, and when it does happen by accident, it tends to end in disaster – witness the hapless Medvedev, on a visit to Crimea, telling a group of elderly women distraught about their low pensions that “there’s no money, but all the best, good health to you, bye!” before sauntering off. Many in the opposition also seem hopelessly detached from the masses – the curse of the Russian liberals since tsarist times. But whether they love him or hate him, most Russian observers agree that Navalny has remarkable political instincts and a powerful charismatic streak. His fiery cocktail of liberalism, nationalism and populism resonates with many.

“People say he’s a provocateur, that’s he’s paid from abroad,” says 62-year-old Nadezhda, listening on in Chelyabinsk. “Is that true? I don’t know. But at least he’s come to speak to us, at least he says the right things. Nothing ever gets done here, nobody ever listens.”

In Russia, where no conspiracy is too outlandish to be considered, some see Navalny as a puppet of the rapacious west, while others suspect him of having a Kremlin backer, perhaps even Putin, using him to pour dirt on inconvenient members of the elite. “I’d find him much more trustworthy if he was dead,” one liberal Muscovite said to me, only half-jokingly, a few days before the interview. “How can he be doing what he’s doing and still be alive? He must have a powerful backer.”

I put this question to Navalny, with a parenthesised apology attached. “Fucking morons,” he says, irritably. “‘Why haven’t they killed you, why haven’t they locked you up?’ People are always asking me this. Look, I have no answer to that question. I suppose the most likely is that they didn’t manage to lock me up when they could have done easily, and then after a certain point it became more difficult.”

It is probable that many of the tip-offs for his various investigations do come from Kremlin insiders; underneath the surface loyalty, a brutal battle for power and influence goes on inside the Russian elite. But even if they have occasional uses for him, Putin’s men have long grappled with the issue of how to deal with Navalny.

The Kremlin has tried different strategies: launching court cases, keeping him under house arrest and even jailing his brother in an apparent attempt to put pressure on him. Sometimes they even tried to crush him honestly: he was allowed to run for mayor of Moscow in 2013. But despite having no access to state television, he won 27% of the vote, which alarmed the Kremlin, and in 2014 he was placed under house arrest while awaiting a new, politicised trial.

I visited him then, at his modest apartment in an unglamorous suburb of Moscow, where he still lives with his wife, Yulia, and their two children. He was as defiant as ever, but seemed sidelined in the newly patriotic atmosphere after the annexation of Crimea. Hardly anyone seemed to notice his absence from the political scene as he spent months banned from speaking with the media or leaving his flat.

Now, as the “Crimea effect” wanes and economic difficulties continue, the Kremlin is finding it harder to mobilise the population ahead of next year’s vote. The presidential administration is on the hunt for someone who could provide token opposition to Putin, but it is not likely to be Navalny. “Too much unpleasant noise,” a source close to the Kremlin told me. “They want someone who will give off the impression of competition, but will not actually attack Putin and the inner circle. They need someone who understands the limits, and Navalny does not recognise any limits.”

Instead, the Kremlin has gone into attack mode. Last week, Russian news outlets reported a secret Kremlin directive to “blacken” Navalny, and sure enough, a video soon appeared on YouTube comparing him to Hitler, complete with photoshopped images of Navalny sieg heiling, wearing a swastika armband. There were reports that university students had been shown the video as part of “educational events” designed to stop them from protesting.

The video was a hamfisted smear attempt, but Navalny does have questions to answer about his nationalist views. Several years ago, he released a number of disturbing videos, including one in which he is dressed as a dentist, complaining that tooth cavities ruin healthy teeth, as clips of migrant workers are shown. In another video, he speaks out in favour of relaxing gun controls, in a monologue that appears to compare migrants to cockroaches.

I ask him if he regrets those videos now, and he’s unapologetic. He sees it as a strength that he can speak to both liberals and nationalists. But comparing migrants to cockroaches? “That was artistic license,” he says. So there’s nothing at all from those videos or that period that he regrets? “No,” he says again, firmly.

Perhaps he has a cynical belief that, with the support of the liberal elite sewn up, the anti-migrant rhetoric can potentially help him appeal to a broader audience. Certainly, most opposition politicians, even if they don’t like Navalny much, are aware that he is the best hope for swelling anti-Putin sentiment.

Navalny has announced another Russia-wide protest on 12 June. The turnout that day will be a good indicator of whether last month’s protest was a flash in the pan, or the start of something seriously threatening for the Kremlin. “You can arrest 100 people and jail them for 15 days. OK, you can jail 1,000 people across the country. But then what?” Before then, he plans dozens more trips across Russia to drum up volunteers to help launch his presidential bid.

After a long day in Chelyabinsk, he looks exhausted, but happily signs autographs for people who approach our table in the airport cafe. I notice that it’s 100 years to the day since Vladimir Lenin arrived at St Petersburg’s Finland Station, in April 1917, spewing radical theses that few took seriously – at least initially. Most Russians, given a combination of very real historical tragedy and careful Kremlin messaging, are wary of revolution or upheaval.

Is there a danger, I ask Navalny, that Putin’s actions over the past years have turned the Kremlin insistence that any political change would be disastrous for Russia into a self-fulfilling prophecy? There’s no outlet for healthy opposition, and any revolutionary uprising would surely be brutally crushed. He sighs, like a teacher irritated with a particularly slow pupil.

“Look, of course the regime will fight back. But all autocratic regimes come to an end. Who would have thought in 1985 that the Soviet Union would all come to an end before long? Nobody. Who would have guessed, in 2010, that the Arab regimes would be over in three months? In 2012, I said the regime would last two more years, and I was wrong, so I’ve stopped making predictions. But sooner or later, it will all come to an end.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/29/recycle-nespresso-coffee-pods-london,"Coffee company Nespresso – part of Swiss multinational Nestlé – is to trial a scheme for consumers to recycle their used aluminium capsules for the first time in the UK, in the face of a growing environmental backlash against increasingly popular single-serve pods, many of which end up in landfill.

A six-month pilot, starting this week in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, will allow Nespresso Club members to recycle their used capsules through their council household recycling service, using special purple bags provided by the company. The borough’s 190,000 residents will only be able to put out capsules made by Nespresso.

Most other capsules on the market are not made of aluminium, usually consisting of mixed plastic and sometimes foil, which require different recycling processes. The dregs of leftover coffee remaining in the pod also make them difficult to process in standard municipal recycling plants. Nespresso has defended its use of aluminium, saying it helps keep the coffee fresh.

The company said it was responding to its users, who have requested more convenient recycling through their local council-run scheme. The trial is part of a project to give customers more convenient recycling options.

“We launched our own dedicated recycling services seven years ago,” said Francisco Nogueira, managing director of Nespresso UK and Ireland. “Every week we are seeing an increase in the volume of capsules being sent in by customers through our system. But we know there is still much to be done and recycling through the municipal system is something our members have asked for.”

The bags of aluminium capsules will be sent to Nespresso’s recycling facility in Congleton, while the waste coffee grounds will be extracted and turned into compost. Nespresso capsules are included in other national recycling schemes such as the Green Dot programme in Germany as well as in a number of other countries, including France and Canada. But in the German city of Hamburg coffee capsules have been banned from state-run buildings as part of a drive to cut waste.

Nespresso introduced the first single-serve coffee machine in 1986, initially using only its own-brand pods. But after Nespresso’s patents began to expire in 2012, competitors started to offer capsules and machines compatible with the Nespresso system.

Nestle would not say what proportion of its capsules are recycled, instead focusing on its recycling “capacity” – which it says is 100%. Market research company Mintel estimated the UK coffee pods market to be worth £182m in 2016 in its most recent study, up from £158m in 2015, and forecast to reach £206m this year. According to their research, 29% of Britons own a coffee pod machine.

The move was welcomed by Trewin Restorick, chief executive of environmental charity Hubbub, who said: “Nespresso pods are mainly aluminium and can be recycled whereas many of their competitors’ pods are mixed plastic which currently can’t be recycled. But using aluminium only makes sense from a resource point of view if the discarded aluminium is recycled, otherwise it is a very carbon intensive way for consumers to get their coffee. Nespresso needs to scale up the recycling process quickly.”

The company’s long-term ambition, a Nespresso spokeswoman said, was to enable more recycling of used capsules via council collection services.",guardian.com,False

Pope Francis has said a third country should mediate the dispute between North Korea and the US, which he said had become “too hot”, risking a war in which “a good part of humanity” would be destroyed.

Donald Trump, meanwhile, answered a question in a television interview about whether military action was possible by saying: “I don’t know. I mean, we’ll see.”

The pope, speaking to reporters aboard the plane taking him back to Rome from Cairo, also said he was ready to meet Trump in Europe next month. He added, however, that he was not aware of any request for a meeting.

In answer to a question about North Korean missile tests and military and diplomatic moves by the US, Francis said the United Nations should re-assert its leadership because it had become “too watered down”.

“I call on … all leaders … to work to seek a solution to problems through the path of diplomacy,” he said.

North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile on Friday, shortly after secretary of state Rex Tillerson warned that failure to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes could lead to “catastrophic consequences”.

The test failed. Trump, who earlier this week said the US could have a “major, major conflict” with North Korea, responded with a tweet. The president wrote: “North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected president when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!”

In remarks released by CBS ahead of an interview set to be broadcast on Sunday and Monday and part-taped at Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, the president was asked if diplomatic and military pressure was working.

“Well, I didn’t say, “don’t test a missile’,” Trump said. “[North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is] going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we’re not going to be very happy.”

Trump said president Xi Jinping of China, “a man that I’ve gotten to like and respect” and whom he met earlier this month in Florida, was also pressuring North Korea.



“But so far,” he continued, “perhaps nothing’s happened and perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We’ll see what happens.”

Trump added: “If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy. And I can tell you also, I don’t believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.”

Would that mean military action?

“I don’t know,” said Trump. “I mean, we’ll see.”

On the papal plane, Francis gave a news conference that lasted around 30 minutes. He said: “There are so many facilitators in the world, there are mediators who offer themselves, such as Norway for example. It [Norway] is always ready to help. That is just one but there are many. But the path is the path of negotiations, of a diplomatic solution.

“This question of missiles in [North] Korea has been brewing for more than a year but now it seems the situation has become has become too hot.

“We are talking about the future of humanity. Today, a widespread war would destroy – I would not say half of humanity – but a good part of humanity, and of culture, everything, everything. It would be terrible. I don’t think that humanity today would be able to withstand it.”

Trump is due in Sicily on 26 and 27 May for a meeting of the heads of the world’s richest nations. The White House has not yet said if he will stop in Rome to meet the pope, which would be an unusual omission for a visiting head of state.

Asked if he would meet Trump, the pope said: “I receive every head of state who asks for an audience.”",guardian.com,False

An Ohio family said they learned just 20 minutes before dinner on Friday evening that a planned mystery guest would be the Facebook founder and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg.

“I knew we were having a mystery guest and that was about it,” Daniel Moore told a local newspaper, the Vindicator of Youngstown. “It was completely incredible.”

The Vindicator reported that Zuckerberg dined with the Moore family in Newton Falls, about 55 miles south-east of Cleveland. The newspaper said Zuckerberg had asked his staff to find Democrats who voted for Donald Trump.

Zuckerberg’s trek to Ohio is part of the Facebook founder’s plan to visit and meet people in all 50 states, part of a string of moves which has lead to widespread speculation about whether Zuckerberg intends to run for office himself.

He and his wife also recently pledged $3bn to “cure, prevent or manage” all disease by the end of the century.

Texts released last year as part of a class action suit showed that Zuckerberg had at least discussed the possibility of a run for office with funders such as venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.

On Christmas Day 2016, Zuckerberg said he no longer considers himself an atheist, a philosophical position which can be a problem for politicians.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/mexican-journalist-apology-press-freedom-pedro-canche,"Pedro Canché has finally won an apology for being jailed after he criticized a state governor. But, he asked, what about the 104 journalists killed since 2006?

Pedro Canché, an indigenous journalist and activist in the southern Mexico state of Quintana Roo, had a hunch the local authorities were closing in on him for his coverage of angry protests over rising water rates in local Mayan communities.

So he filmed a video criticizing the intensely image-conscious state governor, Roberto Borge, and uploaded it to YouTube in August 2014. Just a few days later, police pulled Canché from his car and threw him in prison on charges that he had sabotaged a local waterworks.

The charges were eventually thrown out after nine months as a judge ruled no damage had been caused, and Canché had no relationship with the protest ringleaders.

The National Human Rights Commission later ordered the state government to publicly apologize to Canché and pay compensation, but Borge refused.

This week, a new state administration apologized to Canché – who took the opportunity to highlight Mexico’s ongoing crisis of press freedom, and the unpunished murders of scores of journalists.

“Who will ask for public apologies for the 104 journalists killed [since 2006]? Canché asked. “The Mexican state owes them and their family an enormous debt.”

Canché became a cause célèbre in Quintana Roo and across Mexico as yet another symbol of the country’s struggle for a free press.

His is one of the few positive stories: four journalists have been murdered in Mexico in 2017, including Miroslava Breach, who covered organized crime and drug cartels and was shot dead in March as she drove her son to school in the northern city of Chihuahua. Norte, the Ciudad Juárez newspaper she wrote for, decided to close after her murder, citing journalist safety.

Journalists in Quintana Roo – a state popular with tourists visiting Cancún and Playa del Carmen – complain that the harassment against them came from politicians, who control the press through agreements to provide newspapers with advertising, but allow the government to control their editorial line.



“In the case of Quintana Roo, media harassment always came from the government, not organized crime,” said Vicente Carrera, founder of Noticaribe, an online news organization in Quintana Roo.

Carrera speaks from experience. Noticaribe caught Borge lying about his whereabouts and not disclosing he travelled to the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley. Noticaribe was hit by denial-of-service attacks for the rest of Borge’s term in office, which ran from 2010 to 2016.

Luces del Siglo, a muckraking magazine in Cancún, had its covers “cloned” during Borge’s administration, with covers featuring negative headlines replaced with covers featuring positive headlines and spread online. Staff say stores selling the magazine had their liquor licenses threatened, leaving them few places to sell copies.



Sergio Caballero, Cancún correspondent with newsweekly Proceso, was hit by accusations of being involved with a drug dealer – charges quickly disproven.



How rich hippies and developers went to war over Instagram’s favourite beach Read more

“They invented crimes rather than killing you,” Caballero said of the situation in Quintana Roo, where corruption has grown rife as construction in a tourist mecca mushroomed.

“The Quintana Roo coast is a jackpot,” he said. “They tried to present their government as impeccable. Anyone questioning that was persecuted and attacked.”

Canché started a news website after his time in prison and started fighting for compensation; he had a business manufacturing deck beds and outdoor furniture for hotels in the state, which ceased operating while in prison.

His notoriety led to people slipping him information on scandals. He says it also prompted Borge’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to try striking a deal: the PRI’s 2016 gubernatorial candidate would publicly apologise and indemnify him so long as Canché publicly endorsed the PRI.

Canché declined.



“It’s complicated practicing journalism in a corrupt place,” he said. “They corrupt you and pay you off and eventually you stop pointing out their mistakes … This is what has allowed the government to be corrupt as it is.”

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/fadwa-barghouti-interview-prison-hunger-strike,"Not long before Marwan Barghouti, the imprisoned leader of Fatah, called the largest hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners in recent years, his wife, Fadwa, and daughter Ruba visited him in Hadarim prison, Israel.

“The last time I went to visit him with my daughter was two to three months ago,” recalled Fadwa last week on the 11th day of the strike. “My daughter said to him, ‘I wish you wouldn’t do this. We don’t see you very often. My brothers don’t see you. We will worry about you and not be able to visit.’ He replied: ‘I know it’s going to be painful for the family’.”

Two weeks since it began, the strike by more than 1,000 prisoners in Israeli jails is galvanising Palestinian opinion. On Thursday, the day The Observer spoke to Fadwa in Ramallah, a general strike in support of the prisoners had shuttered shops, offices and schools. Roads were blocked by barricades and there were new posters in the city, depicting the prisoners.

The hunger strike is taking place against a background of rising tension before the 50th anniversary in June of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories, not just between Palestinians and Israelis, but between the main Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas.

At its centre is Barghouti, 57, who is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2004 by an Israeli court of five counts of murder for his role in directing attacks against Israelis during the second intifada, which took place between 2000 and 2005. As the strike began, he was moved from Hadarim into solitary confinement in a prison near Haifa.

Barghouti’s supporters insist the strike is about prisoner rights, not his political ambitions. But inevitably the question of how he is seen – and what he represents – has come to dominate.

In the rhetoric of right-wing Israeli ministers and commentators, Barghouti is a “murderer and terrorist” who some say should have been executed. To many Palestinians he is a hero, sometimes compared to Nelson Mandela, and a figure untainted by the corruption and political machinations that have been a hallmark of the era of the ageing Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.

In her office, hung with pictures of her husband, the strain is beginning to show on Fadwa. With little information from the Israeli prison service, and no access, what news she has comes from other prisoners who have seen her husband and managed to pass back a few details.

Some reports say the strike is already exacting a heavy toll on its participants, who are taking only water and salt, although none so far have suffered serious health problems. “The next days will be hard,” said Fadwa. “The last time I saw him was two weeks before the strike. Since the first day no one has been able visit him. All the information I have is unofficial. Some of the prisoners are suffering and it is getting worse.”

Palestinian hunger strikers' leader moved to solitary confinement Read more

Fadwa said the strikers drew up a list of demands eight months ago, about prison conditions, including visits, access to phones, education and health screening. “They sent letters to the Palestinian leadership saying if Israel did not comply by 16 April the strike would begin, telling the Palestinian Authority that they could help prevent it by putting pressure on the Israelis.”

Even if there have been contacts behind the scenes, it appears there has been no negotiation. Instead Israel has increased pressure on the strikers by cutting them off from the outside world. Supporters say radios have been confiscated and access to lawyers ended. Issa Qaraqe, head of prisoners affairs for the Palestinian Authority, said the leaders have been confined in solitary, and others have been moved to special wings. “They have set up collective confinement sections where hunger strikers have been put with only the clothes they are wearing, mattresses and toothpaste, with personal belongings confiscated.”

Of more concern to Qaraqe and Fadwa has been comments by some Israeli ministers, including the combative intelligence minister Israel Katz, who said Barghouti should have been executed. “When a despicable murderer like Barghouti protests in prison for improved conditions, while the relatives of those he murdered are still in pain, there is only one solution – death penalty for terrorists,” said Katz at the beginning of the protest.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Barghouti as an “arch-terrorist” while the defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, suggested Israel should take the approach of Margaret Thatcher towards the IRA hunger strikers in 1981 and allow them to die.

Describing the Israeli response as “incitement and provocation”, Qaraqe said: “These statements – accompanied by the extreme measures against the hunger strikers – aggravate the situation. This strike did not come out of a vacuum. It came out of the failure to discuss the issues with the Israeli prison authorities … Israel brought the situation to this level.” Beyond the prison walls, the scale of the strike has created problems for all sides. Israeli authorities have previously negotiated with hunger strikers, and their intransigent language has raised tensions. And while senior Palestinian figures, including Abbas, offer vocal support, the timing of the strike – before next week’s meeting between Abbas and Donald Trump in Washington – is clearly troubling them. The result is a complicated balancing act for the Palestinian leadership – lending support while instructing their security services to prevent clashes with Israelis at checkpoints during demonstrations supporting the strike. This underscores the view that Barghouti has limited control of the situation.

Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel go on hunger strike Read more

That he should be at the forefront, even in prison, is hardly surprising to long-time observers. Speaking to this writer three years ago, former Israeli peace negotiator Yossi Beilin, who knew Barghouti, presciently flagged up the challenge that he posed. Inside or outside jail, Barghouti remains one of the most important Palestinian leaders. “I am not an admirer,” Beilin said then. “He is shrewd. A street cat. He is a proud Palestinian, proud of his movement. I saw him [during the Oslo peace talks] as a partner. Someone committed to a political solution.

“He is a politician and a statesman. Like other politicians who have been involved with violence, we have somehow to find a way of dealing with him in a political framework … because he can lead those who follow him to an agreement.”

That “shrewdness” is evident in the hunger strike, and not only its timing ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Israeli occupation. The demands for better prisoner conditions, low key as they are, seem designed to be – in theory at least – achievable.

The question now is whether Barghouti’s well-attested influence and charisma is such that he can lead, even sequestered in solitary confinement.

For Israel, if the protest continues, the choices do not appear good, with security officials aware that dead hunger strikers would risk an upsurge in violence. Force-feeding too, although permitted in Israel following a supreme court ruling last year, is also deeply contentious, with the Israeli Medical Association opposed.

In her office, Fadwa is suddenly tearful, contemplating where the hunger strike will lead: “An element that makes it harder is that I feel other families want to draw strength from me, so I need to hide my feelings,” she said, adding that the strike had made her realise how much her husband had been absent from his family – in prison, wanted, or deported. “I used to blame Marwan for not being there. He said you have to bear with me. It is the struggle for a better life for our children. Now it has been 30 years.”

It is also clear that the absence of any dialogue does not bode well for the health of the strikers. Asked about the risks, she says only: “God will protect him.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/cuba-military-plane-crash-artemisa-eight-dead,"Soviet-made plane crashed into hillside on Saturday morning in the western province of Artemisa, government says

A Cuban military plane crashed into a hillside on Saturday morning in the western province of Artemisa, killing eight troops on board, the government said.

In a written statement, the ministry of the revolutionary armed forces said the Soviet-made, twin-engined turboprop Antonov AN-26 took off from the Playa Baracoa airport outside Havana at 6.38am and crashed into a hillside outside the town of Candelaria about 40 miles away.

“The eight military personnel on board, including the crew, died,” the statement published by state-run media said. “A commission … is investigating the causes of the accident.”

Officials did not immediately release any further information.

The majority of planes flown in Cuba were produced in the Soviet Union. Antonov produced the AN-26 planes in Kiev between 1969 and 1986.

The US Environmental Protection Agency’s main climate change website is “undergoing changes” to better reflect “the agency’s new direction” under Donald Trump.

The announcement, made late Friday evening, left empty what was previously the “official government site” providing “comprehensive information on the issue of climate change and global warming”.

The change came a day before thousands gathered in Washington DC and other US cities to protest inaction on climate change, and hours before the symbolic 100-day mark of the Trump administration.

At the marquee climate protest, the Peoples Climate March in Washington, tens of thousands made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue in sweltering heat on their way to encircle the White House.

Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco. In Chicago, marchers headed from the city’s federal plaza to Trump Tower. In Denver, marchers were met with a dose of spring snow.

Some of the marches drew celebrity attendees, including former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the capital and senator and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders at an event in Montpelier, Vermont.

“Honored to join Indigenous leaders and native peoples as they fight for climate justice,” DiCaprio tweeted.

Any marchers who used their phones to look at the EPA climate change website would have been greeted with a message from the new administration: “This page is being updated.”

“As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,” said JP Freire, an associate administrator for public affairs.

Previously, the website housed data on greenhouse gas emissions from large polluters and reports on the effects of climate change and its impact on human health.

“We want to eliminate confusion,” Freire said, “by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we’re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law.”

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/alexei-navalny-on-putins-russia-all-autocratic-regimes-come-to-an-end,"Vladimir Putin is riding high, expecting a fourth term as president and allegedly influencing elections from the US to France – but Alexei Navalny is determined to stop him

Alexei Navalny is in good spirits for a man who can hardly step outside without being insulted, assaulted or arrested. Earlier this month he was released from a 15-day stint in a Russian jail. And on Thursday, in Moscow, unknown assailants threw green dye in his face, the second such attack in recent months. But his habitual half-smirk never seems to waver.

Perhaps it is because, as Vladimir Putin prepares to stand for yet another presidential term in elections next March, Navalny is threatening to bring some life to the arid landscape that is Russian politics. Navalny was imprisoned because of a protest he called for on 26 March. It surprised everyone with its size. In Moscow alone, police detained more than 1,000 people, and jailed dozens. Although the numbers were small in absolute terms, people protested in dozens of towns across Russia, marking a worrying new development for the Kremlin.

For Navalny, the fortnight behind bars seems to have been an energising rather than a demoralising experience. “There were some others in the jail, and for all of them it was their first protest in their lives,” says Navalny when I meet him in his office in a Moscow business centre. “When they saw me walking past, they were calling out, ‘When’s the next protest?’ They weren’t asking if there would be one, they wanted to know when.”

Navalny, 40, is a lawyer-turned- campaigner whose Anti-Corruption Foundation carries out investigations into the wealth of Putin’s inner circle. After some years when he was on the fringes of liberal politics but known for his Russian nationalist views, Navalny emerged as the main opposition leader in the wave of protests that accompanied the build-up to the last Russian presidential election, in 2012.

The day he was arrested, security agents showed up at his office, packed up all the electronics and walked off with them. When I visit, nothing has yet been returned. He is working on a MacBook with a sticker on it bearing the three-letter Russian word “VOR”, meaning “thief”. A grotesque caricature of Putin’s face peers at me through the O.

Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov looks down at us from a calendar released by the foundation, listing its key investigations. In 2015, Navalny alleged that Peskov had spent his honeymoon on one of the world’s most expensive sailing boats, and spotted him wearing a limited-edition watch worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. (Peskov denied the boat trip and said the watch was a wedding gift.) Navalny has also accused deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov’s wife of using a private jet to fly her pet corgis around Europe, and obtained drone footage of the palatial residences of other ministers and top officials.

Navalny’s most recent investigation was into the prime minister and one-time placeholder president, Dmitry Medvedev, alleging that the man who was once heralded as the beginning of a new liberal era for Russia in fact controlled an empire of luxury residences, vineyards and yachts. “It really pissed people off,” says Navalny. It was the Medvedev investigation that brought people to the streets in March. “Everyone already thought Medvedev was pathetic and pointless, but it turns out he’s pathetic, pointless and a billionaire.”

Medvedev dismissed the allegations as “lies” from a “political imposter”. But even though state television has ignored the allegations, nearly 20 million people have viewed Navalny’s YouTube video. Navalny believes that as poverty continues to blight large swaths of Russia’s population, the mood of protest will only grow. Even the police are angry about government corruption, Navalny claims.

“The cops who arrest me” – Navalny has been detained or arrested multiple times – “always say: ‘We support you, you’re a good guy, we’ve seen the films, Medvedev is taking the fucking piss, but Putin’s foreign policy is great. Of course, the internal policies aren’t so good.’” This chimes with what I have heard on my trips around Russia: people are miserable about their own situations, but believe Putin’s interventions in Ukraine and Syria have saved the world from US hegemony.

And these days it’s not just in Russia that Putin is seen as all-powerful. I ask Navalny about the current alarm over Kremlin interference in the west. He chuckles at the idea that Donald Trump is somehow a “Russian agent” and thinks the west has become hysterical about Russia, but he also says it’s clear the Kremlin will attempt to buy influence where it can, and thinks western politicians come surprisingly cheap.

“For these guys, a billion dollars is nothing,” he says, cocking his head towards the calendar featuring Putin’s inner circle. “And for just a billion dollars you can buy up all the small parties of Europe.”

Navalny says he does his best to counter TV propaganda about renewed Russian influence when campaigning in the regions. “I tell them: ‘OK great, so Putin is promising to rebuild Palmyra, but why don’t you look at the roads in your city? What do you think the priority should be? Fixing the roads in Voronezh or Stavropol or rebuilding Palmyra? The Americans are loaded. Let them fix Palmyra, and we should concentrate on our own problems.’”

A few days later, I meet Navalny again in Chelyabinsk, a two-hour flight east of Moscow. It is one stop on a tour of dozens of cities that he has undertaken ahead of standing in the March presidential 2018 election. An industrial city with a population of just over a million, Chelyabinsk is filled with decaying, Soviet-era factories that emit so much pollution that when you inhale, the air stings the back of the nostrils like wasabi. It’s a Putin heartland, but also the kind of place where the economic hardships of the last few years have been felt most acutely. Navalny and his team arrive late at night, after a bone-crunching six-hour drive from Tyumen, where he opened a campaign headquarters the day before.

In other towns on the campaign trail, he has been assaulted or insulted as he tries to meet with locals. Bomb threats are phoned into venues where he is speaking, leading to the police evacuating them. In Chelyabinsk, the day passes relatively peacefully. In the morning, he speaks to young locals who want to volunteer to help get his presidential campaign underway. There are a couple of hundred people there, many from the city’s nascent hipster class. It’s an impressive turnout, but these people are Navalny’s natural support base. More interesting is how his message goes down later in the day, when he speaks at an environmental protest, against the construction of a new mining and processing plant that will pollute the atmosphere even more.

The local authorities take no chances with their inconvenient guest from the capital. The children’s playground where the rally takes place is surrounded by five police buses, a detachment of riot police in cosmonaut helmets, a bevy of Cossacks who look ready for a fight, and some brawny youths who have shown up, almost certainly on the orders of the authorities, to disrupt proceedings.

“This is an environmental gathering, please behave in a dignified manner,” pleads the frazzled organiser, as 50 or so people begin chants of “Go away!” and “Shame!” the minute Navalny’s name is mentioned.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Navalny after having green dye thrown in his face, the second such attack he has suffered this year. Photograph: Twitter

He takes the stage with a grin. “Let me explain something to you – I’ve got a microphone and you haven’t, so this is all a bit pointless,” he shouts jovially, as the young men keep chanting. “But look, if you don’t like me, don’t vote for me. I’ve come today, and I’ll be leaving this evening. But the plant will stay here, and it’s going to poison you, and your families. Is that what you want? Keep chanting if that’s what you really want.” The provocateurs, extraordinarily, pipe down. Some of them even look a bit ashamed, and listen as Navalny launches into a characteristic rant about Putin’s “crooks and thieves” who are stealing their money and poisoning their cities.

Russia is a country where politicians rarely have to do anything as risky as meeting with real people, and when it does happen by accident, it tends to end in disaster – witness the hapless Medvedev, on a visit to Crimea, telling a group of elderly women distraught about their low pensions that “there’s no money, but all the best, good health to you, bye!” before sauntering off. Many in the opposition also seem hopelessly detached from the masses – the curse of the Russian liberals since tsarist times. But whether they love him or hate him, most Russian observers agree that Navalny has remarkable political instincts and a powerful charismatic streak. His fiery cocktail of liberalism, nationalism and populism resonates with many.

“People say he’s a provocateur, that’s he’s paid from abroad,” says 62-year-old Nadezhda, listening on in Chelyabinsk. “Is that true? I don’t know. But at least he’s come to speak to us, at least he says the right things. Nothing ever gets done here, nobody ever listens.”

In Russia, where no conspiracy is too outlandish to be considered, some see Navalny as a puppet of the rapacious west, while others suspect him of having a Kremlin backer, perhaps even Putin, using him to pour dirt on inconvenient members of the elite. “I’d find him much more trustworthy if he was dead,” one liberal Muscovite said to me, only half-jokingly, a few days before the interview. “How can he be doing what he’s doing and still be alive? He must have a powerful backer.”

I put this question to Navalny, with a parenthesised apology attached. “Fucking morons,” he says, irritably. “‘Why haven’t they killed you, why haven’t they locked you up?’ People are always asking me this. Look, I have no answer to that question. I suppose the most likely is that they didn’t manage to lock me up when they could have done easily, and then after a certain point it became more difficult.”

It is probable that many of the tip-offs for his various investigations do come from Kremlin insiders; underneath the surface loyalty, a brutal battle for power and influence goes on inside the Russian elite. But even if they have occasional uses for him, Putin’s men have long grappled with the issue of how to deal with Navalny.

The Kremlin has tried different strategies: launching court cases, keeping him under house arrest and even jailing his brother in an apparent attempt to put pressure on him. Sometimes they even tried to crush him honestly: he was allowed to run for mayor of Moscow in 2013. But despite having no access to state television, he won 27% of the vote, which alarmed the Kremlin, and in 2014 he was placed under house arrest while awaiting a new, politicised trial.

I visited him then, at his modest apartment in an unglamorous suburb of Moscow, where he still lives with his wife, Yulia, and their two children. He was as defiant as ever, but seemed sidelined in the newly patriotic atmosphere after the annexation of Crimea. Hardly anyone seemed to notice his absence from the political scene as he spent months banned from speaking with the media or leaving his flat.

Now, as the “Crimea effect” wanes and economic difficulties continue, the Kremlin is finding it harder to mobilise the population ahead of next year’s vote. The presidential administration is on the hunt for someone who could provide token opposition to Putin, but it is not likely to be Navalny. “Too much unpleasant noise,” a source close to the Kremlin told me. “They want someone who will give off the impression of competition, but will not actually attack Putin and the inner circle. They need someone who understands the limits, and Navalny does not recognise any limits.”

Instead, the Kremlin has gone into attack mode. Last week, Russian news outlets reported a secret Kremlin directive to “blacken” Navalny, and sure enough, a video soon appeared on YouTube comparing him to Hitler, complete with photoshopped images of Navalny sieg heiling, wearing a swastika armband. There were reports that university students had been shown the video as part of “educational events” designed to stop them from protesting.

The video was a hamfisted smear attempt, but Navalny does have questions to answer about his nationalist views. Several years ago, he released a number of disturbing videos, including one in which he is dressed as a dentist, complaining that tooth cavities ruin healthy teeth, as clips of migrant workers are shown. In another video, he speaks out in favour of relaxing gun controls, in a monologue that appears to compare migrants to cockroaches.

I ask him if he regrets those videos now, and he’s unapologetic. He sees it as a strength that he can speak to both liberals and nationalists. But comparing migrants to cockroaches? “That was artistic license,” he says. So there’s nothing at all from those videos or that period that he regrets? “No,” he says again, firmly.

Perhaps he has a cynical belief that, with the support of the liberal elite sewn up, the anti-migrant rhetoric can potentially help him appeal to a broader audience. Certainly, most opposition politicians, even if they don’t like Navalny much, are aware that he is the best hope for swelling anti-Putin sentiment.

Navalny has announced another Russia-wide protest on 12 June. The turnout that day will be a good indicator of whether last month’s protest was a flash in the pan, or the start of something seriously threatening for the Kremlin. “You can arrest 100 people and jail them for 15 days. OK, you can jail 1,000 people across the country. But then what?” Before then, he plans dozens more trips across Russia to drum up volunteers to help launch his presidential bid.

After a long day in Chelyabinsk, he looks exhausted, but happily signs autographs for people who approach our table in the airport cafe. I notice that it’s 100 years to the day since Vladimir Lenin arrived at St Petersburg’s Finland Station, in April 1917, spewing radical theses that few took seriously – at least initially. Most Russians, given a combination of very real historical tragedy and careful Kremlin messaging, are wary of revolution or upheaval.

Is there a danger, I ask Navalny, that Putin’s actions over the past years have turned the Kremlin insistence that any political change would be disastrous for Russia into a self-fulfilling prophecy? There’s no outlet for healthy opposition, and any revolutionary uprising would surely be brutally crushed. He sighs, like a teacher irritated with a particularly slow pupil.

“Look, of course the regime will fight back. But all autocratic regimes come to an end. Who would have thought in 1985 that the Soviet Union would all come to an end before long? Nobody. Who would have guessed, in 2010, that the Arab regimes would be over in three months? In 2012, I said the regime would last two more years, and I was wrong, so I’ve stopped making predictions. But sooner or later, it will all come to an end.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/29/recycle-nespresso-coffee-pods-london,"Coffee company Nespresso – part of Swiss multinational Nestlé – is to trial a scheme for consumers to recycle their used aluminium capsules for the first time in the UK, in the face of a growing environmental backlash against increasingly popular single-serve pods, many of which end up in landfill.

A six-month pilot, starting this week in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, will allow Nespresso Club members to recycle their used capsules through their council household recycling service, using special purple bags provided by the company. The borough’s 190,000 residents will only be able to put out capsules made by Nespresso.

Most other capsules on the market are not made of aluminium, usually consisting of mixed plastic and sometimes foil, which require different recycling processes. The dregs of leftover coffee remaining in the pod also make them difficult to process in standard municipal recycling plants. Nespresso has defended its use of aluminium, saying it helps keep the coffee fresh.

The company said it was responding to its users, who have requested more convenient recycling through their local council-run scheme. The trial is part of a project to give customers more convenient recycling options.

“We launched our own dedicated recycling services seven years ago,” said Francisco Nogueira, managing director of Nespresso UK and Ireland. “Every week we are seeing an increase in the volume of capsules being sent in by customers through our system. But we know there is still much to be done and recycling through the municipal system is something our members have asked for.”

The bags of aluminium capsules will be sent to Nespresso’s recycling facility in Congleton, while the waste coffee grounds will be extracted and turned into compost. Nespresso capsules are included in other national recycling schemes such as the Green Dot programme in Germany as well as in a number of other countries, including France and Canada. But in the German city of Hamburg coffee capsules have been banned from state-run buildings as part of a drive to cut waste.

Nespresso introduced the first single-serve coffee machine in 1986, initially using only its own-brand pods. But after Nespresso’s patents began to expire in 2012, competitors started to offer capsules and machines compatible with the Nespresso system.

Nestle would not say what proportion of its capsules are recycled, instead focusing on its recycling “capacity” – which it says is 100%. Market research company Mintel estimated the UK coffee pods market to be worth £182m in 2016 in its most recent study, up from £158m in 2015, and forecast to reach £206m this year. According to their research, 29% of Britons own a coffee pod machine.

The move was welcomed by Trewin Restorick, chief executive of environmental charity Hubbub, who said: “Nespresso pods are mainly aluminium and can be recycled whereas many of their competitors’ pods are mixed plastic which currently can’t be recycled. But using aluminium only makes sense from a resource point of view if the discarded aluminium is recycled, otherwise it is a very carbon intensive way for consumers to get their coffee. Nespresso needs to scale up the recycling process quickly.”

The company’s long-term ambition, a Nespresso spokeswoman said, was to enable more recycling of used capsules via council collection services.",guardian.com,False

Pope Francis has said a third country should mediate the dispute between North Korea and the US, which he said had become “too hot”, risking a war in which “a good part of humanity” would be destroyed.

Donald Trump, meanwhile, answered a question in a television interview about whether military action was possible by saying: “I don’t know. I mean, we’ll see.”

The pope, speaking to reporters aboard the plane taking him back to Rome from Cairo, also said he was ready to meet Trump in Europe next month. He added, however, that he was not aware of any request for a meeting.

In answer to a question about North Korean missile tests and military and diplomatic moves by the US, Francis said the United Nations should re-assert its leadership because it had become “too watered down”.

“I call on … all leaders … to work to seek a solution to problems through the path of diplomacy,” he said.

North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile on Friday, shortly after secretary of state Rex Tillerson warned that failure to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes could lead to “catastrophic consequences”.

The test failed. Trump, who earlier this week said the US could have a “major, major conflict” with North Korea, responded with a tweet. The president wrote: “North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected president when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!”

In remarks released by CBS ahead of an interview set to be broadcast on Sunday and Monday and part-taped at Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, the president was asked if diplomatic and military pressure was working.

“Well, I didn’t say, “don’t test a missile’,” Trump said. “[North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is] going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we’re not going to be very happy.”

Trump said president Xi Jinping of China, “a man that I’ve gotten to like and respect” and whom he met earlier this month in Florida, was also pressuring North Korea.



“But so far,” he continued, “perhaps nothing’s happened and perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We’ll see what happens.”

Trump added: “If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy. And I can tell you also, I don’t believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.”

Would that mean military action?

“I don’t know,” said Trump. “I mean, we’ll see.”

On the papal plane, Francis gave a news conference that lasted around 30 minutes. He said: “There are so many facilitators in the world, there are mediators who offer themselves, such as Norway for example. It [Norway] is always ready to help. That is just one but there are many. But the path is the path of negotiations, of a diplomatic solution.

“This question of missiles in [North] Korea has been brewing for more than a year but now it seems the situation has become has become too hot.

“We are talking about the future of humanity. Today, a widespread war would destroy – I would not say half of humanity – but a good part of humanity, and of culture, everything, everything. It would be terrible. I don’t think that humanity today would be able to withstand it.”

Trump is due in Sicily on 26 and 27 May for a meeting of the heads of the world’s richest nations. The White House has not yet said if he will stop in Rome to meet the pope, which would be an unusual omission for a visiting head of state.

Asked if he would meet Trump, the pope said: “I receive every head of state who asks for an audience.”",guardian.com,False

An Ohio family said they learned just 20 minutes before dinner on Friday evening that a planned mystery guest would be the Facebook founder and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg.

“I knew we were having a mystery guest and that was about it,” Daniel Moore told a local newspaper, the Vindicator of Youngstown. “It was completely incredible.”

The Vindicator reported that Zuckerberg dined with the Moore family in Newton Falls, about 55 miles south-east of Cleveland. The newspaper said Zuckerberg had asked his staff to find Democrats who voted for Donald Trump.

Zuckerberg’s trek to Ohio is part of the Facebook founder’s plan to visit and meet people in all 50 states, part of a string of moves which has lead to widespread speculation about whether Zuckerberg intends to run for office himself.

He and his wife also recently pledged $3bn to “cure, prevent or manage” all disease by the end of the century.

Texts released last year as part of a class action suit showed that Zuckerberg had at least discussed the possibility of a run for office with funders such as venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.

On Christmas Day 2016, Zuckerberg said he no longer considers himself an atheist, a philosophical position which can be a problem for politicians.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/mexican-journalist-apology-press-freedom-pedro-canche,"Pedro Canché has finally won an apology for being jailed after he criticized a state governor. But, he asked, what about the 104 journalists killed since 2006?

Pedro Canché, an indigenous journalist and activist in the southern Mexico state of Quintana Roo, had a hunch the local authorities were closing in on him for his coverage of angry protests over rising water rates in local Mayan communities.

So he filmed a video criticizing the intensely image-conscious state governor, Roberto Borge, and uploaded it to YouTube in August 2014. Just a few days later, police pulled Canché from his car and threw him in prison on charges that he had sabotaged a local waterworks.

The charges were eventually thrown out after nine months as a judge ruled no damage had been caused, and Canché had no relationship with the protest ringleaders.

The National Human Rights Commission later ordered the state government to publicly apologize to Canché and pay compensation, but Borge refused.

This week, a new state administration apologized to Canché – who took the opportunity to highlight Mexico’s ongoing crisis of press freedom, and the unpunished murders of scores of journalists.

“Who will ask for public apologies for the 104 journalists killed [since 2006]? Canché asked. “The Mexican state owes them and their family an enormous debt.”

Canché became a cause célèbre in Quintana Roo and across Mexico as yet another symbol of the country’s struggle for a free press.

His is one of the few positive stories: four journalists have been murdered in Mexico in 2017, including Miroslava Breach, who covered organized crime and drug cartels and was shot dead in March as she drove her son to school in the northern city of Chihuahua. Norte, the Ciudad Juárez newspaper she wrote for, decided to close after her murder, citing journalist safety.

Journalists in Quintana Roo – a state popular with tourists visiting Cancún and Playa del Carmen – complain that the harassment against them came from politicians, who control the press through agreements to provide newspapers with advertising, but allow the government to control their editorial line.



“In the case of Quintana Roo, media harassment always came from the government, not organized crime,” said Vicente Carrera, founder of Noticaribe, an online news organization in Quintana Roo.

Carrera speaks from experience. Noticaribe caught Borge lying about his whereabouts and not disclosing he travelled to the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley. Noticaribe was hit by denial-of-service attacks for the rest of Borge’s term in office, which ran from 2010 to 2016.

Luces del Siglo, a muckraking magazine in Cancún, had its covers “cloned” during Borge’s administration, with covers featuring negative headlines replaced with covers featuring positive headlines and spread online. Staff say stores selling the magazine had their liquor licenses threatened, leaving them few places to sell copies.



Sergio Caballero, Cancún correspondent with newsweekly Proceso, was hit by accusations of being involved with a drug dealer – charges quickly disproven.



How rich hippies and developers went to war over Instagram’s favourite beach Read more

“They invented crimes rather than killing you,” Caballero said of the situation in Quintana Roo, where corruption has grown rife as construction in a tourist mecca mushroomed.

“The Quintana Roo coast is a jackpot,” he said. “They tried to present their government as impeccable. Anyone questioning that was persecuted and attacked.”

Canché started a news website after his time in prison and started fighting for compensation; he had a business manufacturing deck beds and outdoor furniture for hotels in the state, which ceased operating while in prison.

His notoriety led to people slipping him information on scandals. He says it also prompted Borge’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to try striking a deal: the PRI’s 2016 gubernatorial candidate would publicly apologise and indemnify him so long as Canché publicly endorsed the PRI.

Canché declined.



“It’s complicated practicing journalism in a corrupt place,” he said. “They corrupt you and pay you off and eventually you stop pointing out their mistakes … This is what has allowed the government to be corrupt as it is.”

https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/apr/24/trash-talk-lviv-rubbish-crisis-ukraine,"The Ukrainian city of Lviv – long noted for its Habsburg-era buildings and vibrant cafes – is in the throes of a trash crisis. Who is really to blame?

An enchanting city in western Ukraine, Lviv has gained a pleasant reputation for its rugged, Habsburg-era beauty and vibrant cafe scene. More recently, however, it has become known for something entirely different: heaping piles of trash.



For months, Lviv has struggled to properly dispose of the several hundred tonnes of waste it produces each day. Municipal officials say local trash collectors face restricted access to nearby landfills, leaving them few other places to turn with the city’s rubbish.

As a result, mountains of garbage routinely sprout up in neighbourhoods and courtyards across this regional capital of around 750,000 people. Today, about a third of Lviv’s waste collection sites are full, their contents often found overflowing across streets and pavements – and people worry about what the coming warm months will mean for the piles of waste.

Ivan Savytskyy says his courtyard was only cleared of garbage after he and his neighbours took turns hassling city hall. “If you call them, remind them, bug them – they’ll come take it away,” he said. “If you don’t, they won’t.”

After many months, the crisis now appears to be nearing its end, thanks to a recent agreement among regional and local officals. But it has still left its mark on this otherwise dynamic regional hub. Lviv has struggled with its rubbish since last May, when a fire tore through a major landfill outside the city, killing four people. Shortly after, other landfills began refusing the city’s waste, allegedly out of fear of a similar catastrophe repeating itself.

Activists and residents banded together to block – in some cases literally – the delivery of garbage to landfills near their towns. In other instances, claims Lviv’s mayor, Andriy Sadovyy, landfills have been ordered by central authorities not to accept deliveries of trash from his city.

“We came to understand that we could become overtaken by garbage,” he says. “And that was probably the desired scenario.”

As is often the case in Ukraine – an ex-Soviet republic that has struggled to adopt a transparent democracy – politics is part of the picture. The waste issue has become a political football, with Sadovyy crying foul over a rubbish “blockade” allegedly manufactured by the central government in Kiev.

The Lviv mayor has become an outspoken critic of Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, who he claims is attempting to tarnish him and bully his political party, Samopomich (“Self Reliance”). While its nationwide support remains in single digits, Samopomich has built a loyal following and its members have staged high profile protests against the government.

Poroshenko and his administration have come under mounting criticism from both political opponents and much of the Ukrainian public for its perceived failure to root out corruption and crack down on a venal oligarchy.

“The logic is very simple: if you want to influence a political party, you pressure its leader,” Sadovyy says. “This is pressure on me personally so that I change my position and force my colleagues to vote in a way that’s suitable for the presidential administration.”

Others dismiss such claims. Sadovyy’s opponents say he is playing politics to cover for city hall’s incompetence, particularly its failure to seek alternative methods of rubbish disposal before last year’s fire at the landfill in the village of Hrybovychi.

Oleh Synyutka, the presidentially appointed governor of the Lviv region, believes the city is artificially prolonging the problem, accusing it of deliberately sabotaging trash collection and failing to properly negotiate deals with other landfills.

This problem will remain the way it is until the bureaucrats sort out their interests among themselves Ivan Savytskyy

Whatever the truth, Lviv’s garbage fiasco has captured the country’s attention and posed a fresh policy challenge to a city that casts itself as a progressive-minded example for the rest of Ukraine. Trash is a national issue. Chronic underfunding from both the state budget and investors has resulted in the lack of an efficient waste management strategy. So vexing is the situation that officials have floated the idea of sending waste into the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, although such proposals are unlikely to gain significant traction.

A two-year deal has just been struck between the Lviv regional administration and nearby towns and cities to accept garbage, while the city awaits new waste processing plant, funded by the French government and the European Investment Bank, expected to begin construction this year.

Recycling is uncommon. A staggering 95% of solid waste is buried throughout the country; by contrast, EU countries recycle more than 40% of their waste.



“In Ukraine, when we’re thinking about which direction to head into, it’s very important to understand where Europe is already heading,” says Iryna Myronova, an activist with Zero Waste Lviv.

In recent months, the group has organised social awareness campaigns challenging local citizens to produce less rubbish. Some cafes are joining in by offering discounts to customers who bring their own containers, or by eliminating sugar packets and plastic straws.

Environmentally conscious behaviour is becoming more widespread among a generation of educated youth. Many are well travelled and exposed to European practices and standards of living. The EU’s expected establishment of a visa-free regime with Ukraine later this summer will surely prolong this trend.

“For them it’s natural,” says Andriy Moskalenko, Lviv’s deputy mayor for development. “It’s not the kind of thing they’ll have to be told to by the local administration, or some other organisation.”

Meanwhile, Savytskyy and other residents of Lviv face further uncertainty. “This problem will remain the way it is until the bureaucrats sort out their interests among themselves,” he says.

https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/apr/21/decline-diner-new-york-retro-eateries-in-pictures,"Home to iconic movie scenes and late-night cheap feasts, New York’s diners have been dramatically declining as a result of rising rents. Photographer Riley Arthur set out to document those remaining

New York-based freelance photographer Riley Arthur has an obsession with diners in the Big Apple. In fact, she has photographed more than 135 of them in all five boroughs (@dinersofnyc). “I see it as both a living archive as well as a historic one,” she says. “I’m rushing to document as many as possible.”

New York City was once home to thousands of diner establishments; now roughly 215 are left, according to the city’s public records. Even in the 18 months since Arthur began her project, eight diners she had photographed have closed. Some of these – Hector’s, Pearl Diner, Square Diner – count among the five last standalone diners in the city.

“Changing tastes do play a role in the continuing closures,” Arthur explains, “but it comes down primarily to ever-rising rents. Gentrification is forcing a dining institution out in favour of high rises and chain eateries.”

Arthur is drawn to diners because of their “storied history in Americana”, which fascinates her both as an insider and an outsider. “I was born and raised in American Samoa, a place with not a single diner or building older than 50 years old,” she says. “I think my interest in Americana grew from living as an American outside of the States. When I moved to New York City and got to know these diners, I knew instantly that I needed to photograph them.”

The project captures the unique designs of each eatery, some with features dating back to the 1920s, as well as their diverse clientele. “In a fast-moving city I think many feel comfort in these decades-old institutions that have stood the test of time,” she adds. While some of the establishments have become famous as movie locations or heritage spots – GoodFellas Diner (formerly Clinton Diner) got its name from the scenes of the iconic Scorsese film that were shot inside; Lexington Candy Shop is another silver screen favourite and tourist landmark – others are just affordable neighbourhood staples.



Although many have stood the test of time, the changes over decades are nonetheless visible, from Buccaneer Diner’s “payphone graveyard”, as Arthur calls it, to the closed-up take-out window covered in graffiti at Kellogg’s Diner.

Former resident Marietta Varga captures a surreal urban landscape devoid of people

Born in 1992, Marietta Varga (@mattivarga) grew up in the Hungarian city of Siófok by the beaches of Lake Balaton. After a decade living abroad, she recently returned to capture a nostalgic portrait of her hometown.

“Siófok is often called Hungary’s summer capital as so many people flock there in the warm months,” she says, “so for most people the city is only known as their holiday destination. But those who grow up here can see the town in an entirely different way.”

Varga explains that Siófok – usually home to approximately 25,000 residents – sees its population increase sevenfold in the summer, becoming packed with crowds of loud tourists. For the rest of the year the city is completely different. “It becomes a calm, peaceful and quiet place,” she says. “It is this side of Siófok that is close to my heart. The old, empty playgrounds and colours of the buildings remind me of my childhood.”

These empty places are what evoke a surreal, dream-like atmosphere in Varga’s photography; in her pictures, Siófok becomes a ghost-like city.

https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/apr/19/where-world-most-sprawling-city-los-angeles,"Driving to work, driving to dinner, driving to meet friends … this quintessentially American invention requires a limitless supply of land and resources. Los Angeles is infamously sprawling but is it the worst offender?

As a young child in Glasgow I was desperate to visit the United States, to see its incredible landscapes and its legendary urbanism: the Grand Canyon, the Manhattan skyline. But it wasn’t until visiting much later that I experienced what is truly the iconic American landscape: the strip, that stretch of multi-lane road leading off into the distance, surrounded on either side by fast-food restaurants, islands of retail lost in seas of asphalt.

Strip development, and its cousin the shopping mall, are symbols of America’s gift to urbanism: sprawl. Los Angeles may be the world’s most famously sprawling city but is it the worst culprit? What about Montreal, or Brisbane, both low density cities in countries with no shortage of space and a strong love of the car?

Sprawl, even though we know when we see it, proves extremely difficult to pin down into a functional definition. Urban sprawl is usually huge, mainly low-density, mostly unplanned, and primarily residential development that covers increasing areas of land around city cores. It is suburbia on steroids or, as Robert Kirkman’s The Ethics of Metropolitan Growth puts it: “sprawl suggests the city has collapsed, like a drunkard on a sidewalk, and is now spreading inexorably outwards, oblivious to the surrounding countryside”.

Sprawl suggests the city has collapsed, like a drunkard on a sidewalk, and is now spreading inexorably outwards … Robert Kirkman

The first and most important common factors is the car. After the second world war, American developers took advantage of cheap oil and the personal mobility made possible by car ownership to create low density residential developments that were not contiguous with places of work, commerce and leisure. These single-use areas often consist of detached houses in the centre of a lawn, scattered over the landscape, often unevenly, with residual gaps of undeveloped land between them and the city.

Although the first use of the term “urban sprawl” appears to be in the context of London in 1955, what we know as sprawl is a quintessentially American invention – it is aspirational, a culture of free individualism, of conspicuous wealth, and requires a seemingly limitless supply of land and resources. To live in sprawl means driving to work, driving to get dinner, driving to meet your friends. It means congestion, as its inhabitants travel ludicrous distances for work or basic services, and isolation due to the lack of the perks of compact city life. Sprawl eats up huge areas in very inefficient ways, destroying arable land and creating monocultures. Furthermore, a sprawling metropolis generates vastly greater amounts of pollution and CO2 than a more compact one.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Suburban Atlanta … a sprawling city according to Demographia and Smart Growth America. Photograph: Alamy

There is no reliable combined measure of sprawl, and many geographers shy away from using the term because of its negative connotations. Perhaps the most reliable metric comes from looking at population density. To look at the whole world is difficult, as definitions of metropolitan boundaries don’t always match up, but free-market think tank Demographia’s annual World Urban Areas survey attempts just that.



The results seem to tally with what we expect: American areas completely dominate the low densities, and among many smaller conurbations the lowest density large cities are Atlanta, Boston, St Louis, Orlando and San Juan. The only real competition the Americans have is with places like Brisbane, Australia, or Quebec City, Canada, both countries with a lot of land and a love of the car. In Europe, down there in the low densities are a number of French urban areas such as Nantes and Toulon, but little else, while the Middle East sneaks in with Saudi Arabia’s Ad Dammam. According to Demographia’s metric, East Asian and South American cities tend not to sprawl at all.

The problem with an average value though, is that it mistakes particular characteristics. For example, London and Athens have very similar average densities, but the Greek city has a far denser core and a much more sprawling suburbia. Some researchers try to overcome these difficulties through additional metrics. Researchers for Smart Growth America introduced mixes of use, presence of “centres”, and accessibility as other factors. Their research was pretty damning for the southern states, with Atlanta, Nashville and Memphis to the bottom of the list.

Elsewhere, Thomas Laidley of NYU recently created a Sprawl Index using aerial imagery. One remarkable aspect was the discovery that Los Angeles is now the densest urban centre in the US. The city which is usually considered the ultimate in sprawl has reached such a consistent intensity of development that there is very little spare land of any kind that could lower its score. Laidley’s index once again gives the worst scores to cities in the deep south: Columbia in South Carolina and Hickory in North Carolina.

Is sprawl so bad?

If it can’t be carefully defined, is sprawl necessarily bad? The great urbanist Lewis Mumford thought so, arguing hysterically in The City in History in 1961 that the endpoint of sprawling megacities was “total human annihilation”, falling victim to technical rationality and the end of organic human existence. Later, characters as ideologically different as the New Urbanists and Richard Rogers would advocate dense, walkable cities with active street life, an anti-sprawl attitude that is now standard in much planning, at least in Britain.



Even as it stands on the cusp of change, the ultimate sprawling city still has to be Los Angeles. Think of the classic view from the Griffith Observatory, looking down at that vast carpet of concrete with its threads of light from the clogged highways. LA is decentred, potentially limitless, and stands for everything terrible about what happens when cities are developed without planning: swathes of low density housing, completely severed by roads, the whole terrain plagued by filthy smog.

Architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne talks of a ‘first’ Los Angeles at the beginning of the 20th century, when it grew much like a European city, before the ‘second’ LA happened post-war: mass-transit was eliminated, the freeway took over, suburbia raced to the edge of the mountains. This created the LA that everyone loves to hate, the “72 suburbs in search of a city” in the words of Dorothy Parker. The ‘third’ LA, which is developing now, is in Hawthorne’s words “having to re-learn the art of sharing the city,” by intensifying its civic culture within its own boundaries, becoming a haven for artists, constructing more collective housing, and with new transport infrastructure that includes walking and cycling.

Others have defended sprawl on its own terms. Architectural historian Reyner Banham wrote the seminal Los Angeles: City of the Four Ecologies in 1972. Excited by its unapologetic modernity, Banham argued that the sprawling quality of LA offered “radical alternatives” to, not deviations from, what was accepted wisdom in urbanism. This refrain was taken up by Jonathan Meades in his 2012 series On France, where he noted sprawl’s prevalence, and mounted a muted defence: “It is not vilified. It is nothing to be ashamed of. Nor is pride taken in it as pride is taken in conventionally elegant towns and orthodoxly pretty villages. Sprawl is accepted, it’s there.”

At the end of the day, sprawl is probably best described as the antithesis of an ideal city type – the compact, efficient pedestrian settlement with a rich civic culture – and thus is an essentially negative term. Advocates for free markets may well argue that sprawl is simply the free and natural result of people’s desire for their own space but in the future, with massive urban growth still to come, is it materially or ecologically possible to sustain 20th century petrol-soaked American sprawl across the world?

https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/apr/21/decline-diner-new-york-retro-eateries-in-pictures,"Home to iconic movie scenes and late-night cheap feasts, New York’s diners have been dramatically declining as a result of rising rents. Photographer Riley Arthur set out to document those remaining

New York-based freelance photographer Riley Arthur has an obsession with diners in the Big Apple. In fact, she has photographed more than 135 of them in all five boroughs (@dinersofnyc). “I see it as both a living archive as well as a historic one,” she says. “I’m rushing to document as many as possible.”

New York City was once home to thousands of diner establishments; now roughly 215 are left, according to the city’s public records. Even in the 18 months since Arthur began her project, eight diners she had photographed have closed. Some of these – Hector’s, Pearl Diner, Square Diner – count among the five last standalone diners in the city.

“Changing tastes do play a role in the continuing closures,” Arthur explains, “but it comes down primarily to ever-rising rents. Gentrification is forcing a dining institution out in favour of high rises and chain eateries.”

Arthur is drawn to diners because of their “storied history in Americana”, which fascinates her both as an insider and an outsider. “I was born and raised in American Samoa, a place with not a single diner or building older than 50 years old,” she says. “I think my interest in Americana grew from living as an American outside of the States. When I moved to New York City and got to know these diners, I knew instantly that I needed to photograph them.”

The project captures the unique designs of each eatery, some with features dating back to the 1920s, as well as their diverse clientele. “In a fast-moving city I think many feel comfort in these decades-old institutions that have stood the test of time,” she adds. While some of the establishments have become famous as movie locations or heritage spots – GoodFellas Diner (formerly Clinton Diner) got its name from the scenes of the iconic Scorsese film that were shot inside; Lexington Candy Shop is another silver screen favourite and tourist landmark – others are just affordable neighbourhood staples.



Although many have stood the test of time, the changes over decades are nonetheless visible, from Buccaneer Diner’s “payphone graveyard”, as Arthur calls it, to the closed-up take-out window covered in graffiti at Kellogg’s Diner.

Former resident Marietta Varga captures a surreal urban landscape devoid of people

Born in 1992, Marietta Varga (@mattivarga) grew up in the Hungarian city of Siófok by the beaches of Lake Balaton. After a decade living abroad, she recently returned to capture a nostalgic portrait of her hometown.

“Siófok is often called Hungary’s summer capital as so many people flock there in the warm months,” she says, “so for most people the city is only known as their holiday destination. But those who grow up here can see the town in an entirely different way.”

Varga explains that Siófok – usually home to approximately 25,000 residents – sees its population increase sevenfold in the summer, becoming packed with crowds of loud tourists. For the rest of the year the city is completely different. “It becomes a calm, peaceful and quiet place,” she says. “It is this side of Siófok that is close to my heart. The old, empty playgrounds and colours of the buildings remind me of my childhood.”

These empty places are what evoke a surreal, dream-like atmosphere in Varga’s photography; in her pictures, Siófok becomes a ghost-like city.

https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/apr/19/where-world-most-sprawling-city-los-angeles,"Driving to work, driving to dinner, driving to meet friends … this quintessentially American invention requires a limitless supply of land and resources. Los Angeles is infamously sprawling but is it the worst offender?

As a young child in Glasgow I was desperate to visit the United States, to see its incredible landscapes and its legendary urbanism: the Grand Canyon, the Manhattan skyline. But it wasn’t until visiting much later that I experienced what is truly the iconic American landscape: the strip, that stretch of multi-lane road leading off into the distance, surrounded on either side by fast-food restaurants, islands of retail lost in seas of asphalt.

Strip development, and its cousin the shopping mall, are symbols of America’s gift to urbanism: sprawl. Los Angeles may be the world’s most famously sprawling city but is it the worst culprit? What about Montreal, or Brisbane, both low density cities in countries with no shortage of space and a strong love of the car?

Sprawl, even though we know when we see it, proves extremely difficult to pin down into a functional definition. Urban sprawl is usually huge, mainly low-density, mostly unplanned, and primarily residential development that covers increasing areas of land around city cores. It is suburbia on steroids or, as Robert Kirkman’s The Ethics of Metropolitan Growth puts it: “sprawl suggests the city has collapsed, like a drunkard on a sidewalk, and is now spreading inexorably outwards, oblivious to the surrounding countryside”.

Sprawl suggests the city has collapsed, like a drunkard on a sidewalk, and is now spreading inexorably outwards … Robert Kirkman

The first and most important common factors is the car. After the second world war, American developers took advantage of cheap oil and the personal mobility made possible by car ownership to create low density residential developments that were not contiguous with places of work, commerce and leisure. These single-use areas often consist of detached houses in the centre of a lawn, scattered over the landscape, often unevenly, with residual gaps of undeveloped land between them and the city.

Although the first use of the term “urban sprawl” appears to be in the context of London in 1955, what we know as sprawl is a quintessentially American invention – it is aspirational, a culture of free individualism, of conspicuous wealth, and requires a seemingly limitless supply of land and resources. To live in sprawl means driving to work, driving to get dinner, driving to meet your friends. It means congestion, as its inhabitants travel ludicrous distances for work or basic services, and isolation due to the lack of the perks of compact city life. Sprawl eats up huge areas in very inefficient ways, destroying arable land and creating monocultures. Furthermore, a sprawling metropolis generates vastly greater amounts of pollution and CO2 than a more compact one.

There is no reliable combined measure of sprawl, and many geographers shy away from using the term because of its negative connotations. Perhaps the most reliable metric comes from looking at population density. To look at the whole world is difficult, as definitions of metropolitan boundaries don’t always match up, but free-market think tank Demographia’s annual World Urban Areas survey attempts just that.



The results seem to tally with what we expect: American areas completely dominate the low densities, and among many smaller conurbations the lowest density large cities are Atlanta, Boston, St Louis, Orlando and San Juan. The only real competition the Americans have is with places like Brisbane, Australia, or Quebec City, Canada, both countries with a lot of land and a love of the car. In Europe, down there in the low densities are a number of French urban areas such as Nantes and Toulon, but little else, while the Middle East sneaks in with Saudi Arabia’s Ad Dammam. According to Demographia’s metric, East Asian and South American cities tend not to sprawl at all.

The problem with an average value though, is that it mistakes particular characteristics. For example, London and Athens have very similar average densities, but the Greek city has a far denser core and a much more sprawling suburbia. Some researchers try to overcome these difficulties through additional metrics. Researchers for Smart Growth America introduced mixes of use, presence of “centres”, and accessibility as other factors. Their research was pretty damning for the southern states, with Atlanta, Nashville and Memphis to the bottom of the list.

Elsewhere, Thomas Laidley of NYU recently created a Sprawl Index using aerial imagery. One remarkable aspect was the discovery that Los Angeles is now the densest urban centre in the US. The city which is usually considered the ultimate in sprawl has reached such a consistent intensity of development that there is very little spare land of any kind that could lower its score. Laidley’s index once again gives the worst scores to cities in the deep south: Columbia in South Carolina and Hickory in North Carolina.

Is sprawl so bad?

If it can’t be carefully defined, is sprawl necessarily bad? The great urbanist Lewis Mumford thought so, arguing hysterically in The City in History in 1961 that the endpoint of sprawling megacities was “total human annihilation”, falling victim to technical rationality and the end of organic human existence. Later, characters as ideologically different as the New Urbanists and Richard Rogers would advocate dense, walkable cities with active street life, an anti-sprawl attitude that is now standard in much planning, at least in Britain.



Even as it stands on the cusp of change, the ultimate sprawling city still has to be Los Angeles. Think of the classic view from the Griffith Observatory, looking down at that vast carpet of concrete with its threads of light from the clogged highways. LA is decentred, potentially limitless, and stands for everything terrible about what happens when cities are developed without planning: swathes of low density housing, completely severed by roads, the whole terrain plagued by filthy smog.

Architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne talks of a ‘first’ Los Angeles at the beginning of the 20th century, when it grew much like a European city, before the ‘second’ LA happened post-war: mass-transit was eliminated, the freeway took over, suburbia raced to the edge of the mountains.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/27/we-are-a-target-south-korean-village-frontline-with-north-us-thaad-defence-system-in-seongju,"Arrival of Thaad defence system in Seongju fails to reassure villagers as voters in Seoul call for engagement with Pyongyang not threats

It took just a few hours to transform Seongju from a sleepy farming village in the South Korean foothills into a symbol of the US military might ranged against North Korea.



Once a retreat for amateur golfers , the Lotte Seongju country club is now in the hands of the most powerful military in the world and its South Korean allies.

On land where dispirited golfers once cursed a badly sliced drive, work is under way to rush into service a defence system able to locate and destroy North Korean missiles before they threaten the South – or the 28,500 US troops stationed there.

Villagers complained about the disruption caused by the arrival of the terminal high-altitude area defense (Thaad) system but the impact has been spread far beyond the bucolic hills of Seongju.

The deployment has dominated the final days of South Korea’s election campaign, pushed Seoul’s relations with Beijing to breaking point and cast doubt on the wisdom of Donald’s Trump’s decision to dispense with “strategic patience” towards Pyongyang.

Most of Seongju’s few hundred residents were asleep when six camouflaged trailers rolled in before dawn on Wednesday, carrying the components of the Thaad system.

As they digested their sudden – and unwanted – propulsion into the heart of the latest round of tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, bewilderment quickly turned to anger.

“Look at how beautiful this place is,” said Baek Gwang-soon, a resident in her mid-70s who was briefly questioned by police as she left her home to tend her crops. “Until a few weeks ago, I had no idea what Thaad even was and now it’s right on our doorstep.”

When assembled, the first battery will comprise six truck-mounted launchers that can fire up to 48 interceptors towards incoming missiles picked up by the system’s X-band radar.

Originally scheduled to go into operation by the end of the year, Thaad could be up and running in time to further complicate South Korea ’s presidential election on 9 May – a vote triggered by domestic political scandal but which has been dominated by the North and Thaad.

Moon Jae-in, a liberal former human rights lawyer who is favourite to succeed Park Geun-hye, who was impeached , condemned Thaad’s deployment. But to the disappointment of his liberal support base, he has promised only to reconsider its long-term future.

Trump has expressed an intention to take a tougher stance against Pyongyang over its missile and nuclear programmes but it is unclear how his administration will act differently from Barack Obama’s .

Trump and his officials have hinted that they would respond militarily to a further nuclear or missile test by North Korea. However, such action from the US would be fraught with risks of triggering a wider war with mass casualties.

After a rare White House briefing to the entire US Senate on Wednesday, Washington told the South Korean government that sanctions and diplomatic pressure remained its priorities for dealing with North Korea.

Adm Harry Harris, commander of the US Pacific command, said on Wednesday: “[Thaad] will be operational in the coming days and able to better defend South Korea against the growing North Korean threat.” He added that the US carrier strike group led by the USS Carl Vinson – which Trump had described as an “armada” – was now east of Okinawa and within “striking range” of North Korea.



The people of Seongju were not reassured, however. On top of concerns about the effect the defence system’s radar’s electromagnetic waves may have on them and their melon crops, many believe Thaad’s deployment has put them firmly in Pyongyang’s sights.

“We are worried that we are now a North Korean target,” said Seongju’s mayor, Lee Seok-joo. “But there is also a strong element of political theatre in all of this. To get the votes they need, the main candidates in the presidential election are pandering to conservative voters – and that means not outwardly opposing Thaad.”

But the deployment of the missiles is not unanimously welcomed by voters in Seoul, 155 miles (250 km) north-west of Seongju.

Twice a year, air raid sirens ring out across the South Korean capital, emptying its busy streets in minutes as people take cover in subway stations and underground shopping arcades.

The drills are a reminder that Seoul and its population of 10 million people are just 35 miles south of the demilitarised zone, the heavily armed border that has separated north from south since the cessation of Korean war in an uneasy truce more than six decades ago.

But on a warm Thursday afternoon, North Korea appeared furthest from the minds of many of the city’s residents. In the Sinchon neighbourhood, shoppers paused to watch a trio of young K-pop hopefuls going through the motions, while university students filled cafes.

Seoul did as it often does when faced with a North Korean crisis, and offer a collective shrug of the shoulders.

Cho Eun-hye, a 21-year-old civil servant, laughed when asked whether she was concerned about a North Korean missile attack.

“Rather than give in to the Americans by deploying Thaad, I would rather see South Korea make a genuine attempt to engage with the North,” she said. “It might not bring about reunification but, at the very least, we will be able to peacefully coexist.”

But older South Koreans, who played a decisive role in installing Park and her equally conservative predecessor Lee Myung-bak in the presidential Blue House, were less optimistic.

“People of my generation are more worried about our national security because we know what war is like,” said Kwon Ki-hwan, who was 12 when the Korean war started in 1950. “I’ve seen what happens to people during a war with my own eyes, so I support anyone who puts our security first. And that includes deploying Thaad.

“I would prefer peace through talks, of course, but that’s for the politicians to decide. My biggest fear is that one day we will have a second Korean war. It might be sparked by a decision made by the US, but the victims will be Koreans.”

In Seongju, residents vowed they were not about to abandon their newfound role as activists on the frontline of South Korean politics.

Although many voted for Park, who agreed to deploy Thaad just before her presidency was plunged into crisis last summer, they were holding aloft banners this week in Seoul that would not have been out of place at a leftwing rally: “No Thaad. No War”, and “Hey USA – are you friends or occupation troops?”

Moon’s foreign policy adviser, Choi Jong-kun, said: “The public are fed up with the status quo on North Korea. They want pressure and sanctions to be joined by some sort of engagement.”

Moon wants to bring the North Koreans to the negotiating table “to make them ponder what might happen if we sat down together”, according to Choi, an associate professor of politics and international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. “Until now, it’s been the same old mantra from South Korea: unless you change first, we won’t talk to you.”

Choi said a Moon presidency would work closely with the Trump administration but would “regain control” of North Korea policy after weeks of political limbo after Park’s impeachment.

“Moon is alarmed by the idea that ensuring the safety of South Koreans could one day be beyond our control,” he said. “Conservatives liked to boast that they took a hardline against the North and were stronger on national security, but the scorecard for the past two presidents says the exact opposite.”

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/30/man-arrested-after-48-year-old-stabbed-to-death-on-london-bus,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 48-year-old man who was stabbed to death on a bus.

Archie Sheppard, from Neasden, north-west London, was subjected to a “violent and sustained attack” on the top deck of a No 189 bus before being discovered by a passenger.

Police and paramedics were called to the bus in Gloucester Place, Marylebone, at 12.10am on Friday but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

On Saturday detectives arrested a 38-year-old man in Mulgrave Road, Fulham, south-west London, on suspicion of murder. He was also detained on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon.

Scotland Yard appealed for help in searching for a white male seen with Sheppard shortly before he boarded the bus in Brent Cross, north London, at 11.13pm on Thursday.

The man then fled the bus as it reached Gloucester Place and the junction with Montagu Place, heading in the direction of Marble Arch, police said.

DCI Noel McHugh, said: “It is important that we establish and get a clearer picture as to who Mr Sheppard was and the lifestyle he was leading, in particular anyone who was with him on Thursday 27 April and anyone who stayed at his home in Neasden.

“I am also making a fresh appeal for information and witnesses to come forward. A number of people have assisted us with our inquiry but there are still a number of witnesses that have yet to come forward and I believe that they could hold vital information that could help with progressing this investigation.”

A postmortem examination was due to take place on Saturday.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/michael-ignatieff-fight-academic-freedom-hungary-central-european-university-refugees,"Michael Ignatieff is living life in reverse. Most people opt for their most demanding roles early on, then a quieter life. But after a career in philosophy, novel-writing and journalism, Ignatieff chose politics in his native Canada, followed at the age of 69 by his most difficult role to date: rector of the Central European University in Budapest. It is a task that has led him into battle to defend academic freedom against the onslaught of the Hungarian government, as its populist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, strives to bring the CEU to heel through a new education law.

Under recent Hungarian legislation aimed at overseas-registered universities, staff will have to acquire work permits, which the CEU says will restrict its ability to hire staff. The government is also demanding that the university open a wing in America and that it no longer teach US-accredited courses.

Hungary’s liberals find a hero in their battle against Viktor Orbán Read more

Ignatieff and the university have secured the support of the European Union, which has launched legal action against Hungary over its new law. Brussels says it breaches the CEU’s right to exist and serve its students. Last week, as Orbán came out fighting when he addressed the European parliament, defending his law and claiming the real clash between him and the EU was about refugees, Ignatieff was in London, also talking about refugees.

Orbán has refused to take Hungary’s allocated number of refugees under an EU plan to deal with the exodus of people fleeing strife in Africa and the Middle East. Ignatieff, who was giving a lecture at the University of East London, described how the CEU, founded 25 years ago by the financial speculator George Soros , has striven to educate refugees, offering them the chance to transform their fortunes.

Some say that it is this work in particular that has provoked Orbán’s ire, and Ignatieff told his London audience that outreach operations with asylum seekers marooned in camps on the Hungarian border had been a point of conflict with the Orbán administration.

But – perhaps mindful of how the Hungarian government might monitor his every word – the CEU’s rector was at pains to point out: “We do not work with illegal immigrants. Every government has the right to protect its borders and its country’s sovereignty. The issue here is demonisation of people, the ‘othering’ of others.”

Before he took up his post at the university last year, Ignatieff had been teaching at Harvard. In 2011 he had stepped down from the leadership of the Liberal party of Canada.

“If you want to see hunger for learning, you see it in refugees,” he says. “We are proud to provide them with the education we can offer, albeit limited. Our hope is that by educating refugees, others will regard these folks as human beings.”

At the start of the refugee crisis, this recognition of the essential humanity of asylum seekers was apparent in the response of ordinary Europeans. Ignatieff recalls that the police in Munich asked on Twitter for extra food and blankets for refugees; people turned up with supplies within 20 minutes. The same happened at first in Hungary, he said.

“Now politicians are making a wilful attempt to confuse economic migrants with refugees – that is a distortion of the facts,” he says indignantly.

As he notes, refugee crises are not new in Europe. They happened after the first and second world wars, as well as after the Russian revolution, which brought his grandparents to Dover in 1919, where they were welcomed by the British. Ignatieff was born in Canada and had a peripatetic childhood while his father worked for the Canadian diplomatic service.

After an early academic career which brought him to King’s College, Cambridge, he moved into writing and broadcasting in Britain, which brought a Booker prize nomination for his novel Scar Tissue, a stint as a presenter of BBC2’s The Late Show, and a column in the Observer. In those London years he became a public intellectual, Renaissance-man pin-up, thanks to a shock of black hair, an educated Canadian drawl and a laidback persona. In 2003, Maclean’s magazine named him Canada’s sexiest cerebral man.

The dirty tricks that demonise George Soros | Nick Cohen Read more

Today, the hair is greyer and this is a far more impassioned Ignatieff. “I have done many things in my career but one thing I had not done was run an institution. When I arrived in Budapest, at first the government was very welcoming. But the geopolitical scene has changed and this is a fight I care about tremendously. If it is my job to defend academic freedom, then I will do it.”

It is also a chance for Ignatieff to reinvent himself as a darling of the progressives, who were dismayed by his take on international relations after 9/11. In 2003, he published Empire Lite: Nation-Building in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan, which argued that the US had a responsibility to create a humanitarian empire through nation-building and even force. That same year, this philosophy led him to support the invasion of Iraq, causing him to be criticised by human rights activists. Later, Ignatieff wrote a mea culpa.

Now he is on the frontline of the consequences of that invasion and the other recent traumas in the Middle East, as refugees make their way through Europe. But while his defence of academic freedom might please them, progressive thinkers may be surprised by his take on the refugee crisis, for his critique includes the theory that human rights law does not work as a solution. He points to the way that human rights of different groups now compete with one another and, faced with refugees, others counter the new arrivals’ rights with their own. The solution, he says, is to not depend on such a legalistic approach but to return to a concept of hospitality, found in religions.

“There is a deep tradition of welcoming the stranger in many religions, but while you have that culture you also have people struggling against fear. And this is genuine fear, it is not racist. You can’t just lecture people about doing their moral duty. Somehow we have to recover a sense of solidarity.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/30/observer-view-of-future-of-israel-and-palestine,"It has long been considered axiomatic, at least on Europe’s political left, that Palestine lies at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict and that lasting peace in the Middle East depends, first and foremost, on resolution of this decades-old struggle. In recent years, such thinking has been overtaken by events. The problem has been sidelined. Yet as the region approaches the 50th anniversary of the six-day war that left Palestinian land under permanent occupation, and as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners begin their third week on hunger strike in Israeli jails, fears of a new intifada are growing. It is time to refocus attention on this dangerous stalemate before it again explodes into open, violent confrontation.

Wife of jailed Fatah leader tells of her fears for hunger strikers Read more

It is not as though the plight of the Palestinians has been forgotten or that the threats Israelis face have suddenly diminished. It is that, in the total absence of progress towards a settlement, other events have taken precedence. One is the spread of Islamist fundamentalism, principally in the form of al-Qaida and Isis. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the US redirected energy and resources towards Iraq and Afghanistan. The Arab spring revolts of 2011 also shifted the spotlight away from Palestine and on to the grievances of Arab citizens towards their own governments. Shaky Arab regimes discovered shared interests with Israel that outweighed old loyalties to the Palestinians.

Syria’s civil war has encompassed all these noxious elements – jihadi extremism, popular insurrection, governmental repression, military atrocities and social breakdown, leading to massive refugee outflows and humanitarian emergencies. Set against this enormous conflict, drawing in Russia, Iran and religious fanatics from both sides of the Sunni-Shia divide, the Palestinian problem has paled by comparison. The west’s chronic indecision over Syria, highlighted last week by Boris Johnson’s irresponsible and foolish remarks about British military action, underscores how little faith should be placed in its determination to secure a Palestinian deal.

It would be wrong to suggest the US and others have stopped trying. John Kerry, former secretary of state, pushed hard to revive the moribund peace process. The French hosted an international conference in January to promote a two-state solution, still the only workable way forward. The meeting’s final statement called on Israel to withdraw to its 1967 borders and relinquish control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as required by UN resolutions, and appealed to both parties to “abstain from unilateral actions” that could jeopardise future negotiations.

Such self-evidently sensible appeals, heard so many times before, are futile unless backed by active measures to persuade and coerce the main players. These are currently lacking. In Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel has a confrontational prime minister whose narrow, inflexible vision of what best assures Israel’s security is itself a danger to the country he serves. In Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinians have a weak, ineffective leader whose authority is undermined by Hamas. Neither man is a credible partner for peace. Neither seems to have a viable plan for ending the impasse. When Abbas meets Donald Trump in Washington this week, perhaps he will surprise us. Perhaps Trump will have something constructive to say. Or not.

Trump is correct about one thing. Speaking last week, he declared there was “no reason” why Israelis and Palestinians should not live in peace. And, in plain terms, if both sides are prepared to compromise – and possible compromises on land, borders, security, refugees and Jerusalem have been rehearsed – Trump is right. What is needed, and is lacking, is brave, imaginative leadership.

Despite his violent history, Marwan Barghouti, organiser of the prison hunger strike, is regarded by many Palestinians as one of their most able leaders. Many outsiders who wish Israel well also share that opinion and would like to see him take a more active public role, freed from his prison shackles. Barghouti’s recent op-ed in the New York Times likened the Palestinian struggle to independence movements in South Africa and elsewhere. One thing they all shared, he suggested, was the inevitability of ultimate victory. Palestinians, he wrote, were engaged in “a long walk to freedom”.

Barghouti is no Nelson Mandela. But neither can his claims and those of his people be indefinitely deferred. Trying to do so risks another explosion – another nakba – that, for all the wrong reasons, would again place Palestine at the forefront of Middle East woes.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/28/ben-obumselu-obituary,"My father, Ben Obumselu, who has died aged 86, was a leading literary critic, a key figure in the Biafran war and, later, an influential political adviser in Nigeria. A combination of scholarship and political engagement informed much of his life.

He was among a formidable generation of university graduates in the mid-1950s poised to lead Nigeria at independence in 1960. At Ibadan University, where he studied English and classics, he was the first president of the National Union of Nigerian Students. Like his contemporaries, the writers Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka and Chris Okigbo, he was a protege of the pioneering professor of English Molly Mahood.

Ben was born and brought up in Oba, on the outskirts of Onitsha, on the banks of the river Niger, the son of Albert Obumselu, a builder and church organist, and his wife, Naomi (nee Azubuike). He attended Dennis Memorial grammar school in Onitsha.

After graduating from Ibadan University, he became assistant registrar at the West African Examinations Council in Accra and Lagos. He went to Oxford University in 1960 to work for a doctorate, and in 1963 returned to Ibadan to lecture at the university. When the Nigerian civil war began in 1967 he left for his home region in eastern Nigeria, joining the Biafran struggle. There, he had a variety of assignments including in intelligence, and as an adjutant general in the Biafran army. He was speech writer and special adviser to the Biafran leader Emeka Ojukwu, helping to write the Ahiara Declaration, setting out Biafra’s vision.

At the war’s end in 1970 he left Nigeria and worked in universities in Zambia, Congo, Malawi, Botswana and Swaziland, as a senior lecturer and professor, becoming a leading critic of postcolonial literature. He visited Mozambique and South Africa and in 1974 became John Cadbury fellow at the Centre of West African Studies, Birmingham University. An intellectual curiosity and restlessness informed his travelling, voracious reading and many friendships.

He returned to Nigeria in 1981 to serve as political adviser to the civilian governor of Anambra state, Jim Nwobodo, who had been a student of Ben’s at Ibadan University.

After the return of military rule in 1983, Ben went back into academia, working in universities in eastern Nigeria as a dean and senior lecturer. In 1999, when civil rule was restored, he moved into newspaper publishing and back into political activity. Though he avoided the limelight, he was widely respected and found himself drawn into Nigerian public life, becoming a leading figure in the pan-Igbo political organisation Ohaneze Ndigbo.

He was admired by many colleagues and ex-students, who published a book of essays in his honour.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/30/peoples-climate-march-thousands-rally-to-denounce-trumps-environmental-agenda,"Hundreds of marches held around the US including in Washington DC, Seattle, Boston and San Francisco

Thousands of people across the US have marched in rain, snow and sweltering heat to demand action on climate change mass protests that coincided with president Donald Trump’s 100th day in office and took aim at his agenda for rolling back environmental protections.

A sea of protesters taking part in the People’s Climate March swarmed in front of the White House to demand Trump rethink plans to reverse the climate change policies.

Organisers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco.

A wet spring snow fell in Denver, where several hundred activists posed in the shape of a giant thermometer for a photograph and a dozen people rode stationary bikes to power the loudspeakers. In Chicago, a rain-soaked crowd of thousands headed from the city’s federal plaza to Trump Tower.

In Washington, as temperatures rose above 90F, tens of thousands of people marched from the grounds of the US Capitol and passed the White House en route to the Washington Monument for a rally.

Participants on Saturday said they object to Trump’s rollback of restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants, among other things.

Many of the protesters carried signs with slogans such as “The seas are rising and so are we” and “Don’t be a fossil fool.” As the procession passed the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, marchers booed and chanted “shame.“

While a good-natured mood prevailed and there were no signs of violence, many demonstrators said they were angered by the prospect of Trump carrying through on his vow to roll back protections put in place by his predecessor Barack Obama.

“We’re going to rise up and let them know that we’re sick and tired of seeing our children die of asthma,” said Reverend Leo Woodberry of Florence, South Carolina, who spoke during a press conference before the march. “We’re sick and tired of seeing people with cancer because of coal ash ponds. We’re sick and tired of seeing sea-level rise.”

Elsewhere, more than 2,000 people gathered at the Maine State House in Augusta. Speakers included a lobsterman, a solar company owner and members of the Penobscot Nation tribe.

“I’ve seen firsthand the impacts of climate change to not only the Gulf of Maine, but also to our evolving fisheries, and to the coastal communities that depend upon them,” said lobsterman Richard Nelson of Friendship, Maine.

People in the crowd spoke about the importance of addressing climate change to industries such as renewable energy, forestry, farming and seafood.

Trump’s administration is considering withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, which more than 190 countries including the United States signed in hopes of curbing global warming. Trump has also proposed deep cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency and the elimination of many environmental regulations.

In his campaign, Trump called climate change a hoax. Last month he kept a promise to the coal industry by undoing climate-change rules put in place by Obama.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/cuba-military-plane-crash-artemisa-eight-dead,"Soviet-made plane crashed into hillside on Saturday morning in the western province of Artemisa, government says

A Cuban military plane crashed into a hillside on Saturday morning in the western province of Artemisa, killing eight troops on board, the government said.

In a written statement, the ministry of the revolutionary armed forces said the Soviet-made, twin-engined turboprop Antonov AN-26 took off from the Playa Baracoa airport outside Havana at 6.38am and crashed into a hillside outside the town of Candelaria about 40 miles away.

“The eight military personnel on board, including the crew, died,” the statement published by state-run media said. “A commission … is investigating the causes of the accident.”

Officials did not immediately release any further information.

The majority of planes flown in Cuba were produced in the Soviet Union. Antonov produced the AN-26 planes in Kiev between 1969 and 1986.

Pope Francis has said a third country should mediate the dispute between North Korea and the US, which he said had become “too hot”, risking a war in which “a good part of humanity” would be destroyed.

Donald Trump, meanwhile, answered a question in a television interview about whether military action was possible by saying: “I don’t know. I mean, we’ll see.”

The pope, speaking to reporters aboard the plane taking him back to Rome from Cairo, also said he was ready to meet Trump in Europe next month. He added, however, that he was not aware of any request for a meeting.

In answer to a question about North Korean missile tests and military and diplomatic moves by the US, Francis said the United Nations should re-assert its leadership because it had become “too watered down”.

“I call on … all leaders … to work to seek a solution to problems through the path of diplomacy,” he said.

North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile on Friday, shortly after secretary of state Rex Tillerson warned that failure to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes could lead to “catastrophic consequences”.

The test failed. Trump, who earlier this week said the US could have a “major, major conflict” with North Korea, responded with a tweet. The president wrote: “North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected president when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!”

In remarks released by CBS ahead of an interview set to be broadcast on Sunday and Monday and part-taped at Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, the president was asked if diplomatic and military pressure was working.

“Well, I didn’t say, “don’t test a missile’,” Trump said. “[North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is] going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we’re not going to be very happy.”

Trump said president Xi Jinping of China, “a man that I’ve gotten to like and respect” and whom he met earlier this month in Florida, was also pressuring North Korea.



“But so far,” he continued, “perhaps nothing’s happened and perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We’ll see what happens.”

Trump added: “If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy. And I can tell you also, I don’t believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.”

Would that mean military action?

“I don’t know,” said Trump. “I mean, we’ll see.”

On the papal plane, Francis gave a news conference that lasted around 30 minutes. He said: “There are so many facilitators in the world, there are mediators who offer themselves, such as Norway for example. It [Norway] is always ready to help. That is just one but there are many. But the path is the path of negotiations, of a diplomatic solution.

“This question of missiles in [North] Korea has been brewing for more than a year but now it seems the situation has become has become too hot.

“We are talking about the future of humanity. Today, a widespread war would destroy – I would not say half of humanity – but a good part of humanity, and of culture, everything, everything. It would be terrible. I don’t think that humanity today would be able to withstand it.”

Trump is due in Sicily on 26 and 27 May for a meeting of the heads of the world’s richest nations. The White House has not yet said if he will stop in Rome to meet the pope, which would be an unusual omission for a visiting head of state.

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/30/single-parents-left-vulnerable-by-delays-to-child-support-increase,"Department of Human Services defends secrecy around wait times, claiming parents would swamp the agency if they knew how long the process took

Parents face long delays applying to the Department of Human Services to increase their child support, leaving them financially vulnerable and emotionally distressed, according to a single mothers’ group.

The Community and Public Sector Union and public-sector sources have told Guardian Australia it takes at least seven weeks to allocate applications to vary child support to case officers, although the department has disputed the figure.

The department has refused to reveal wait times for assigning reassessments, claiming it would be swamped with inquiries if parents knew how long the process took.

Instead it says all reassessments are allocated and then completed within an average of 60 days.

Call for more support for parents as data shows one in 33 children in protective services Read more

The child support system allows a parent to apply to vary an initial assessment to claim higher payments from the other parent in many circumstances.

These include: that the other parent earns more than reflected in the assessment; the child has special needs, including medical bills; the parents agreed to send the child to private school; or a parent is struggling to support them due to care of another child.

The deputy national president of the CPSU, Lisa Newman, told Guardian Australia the child support section of the DHS had a backlog of 1,500 cases for reassessment for six months.

“We believe this has been a result of greater customer awareness of the reassessment process and the workload and staffing changes that have occurred over the last few years,” she said. “Losing permanent jobs has certainly not helped.”

Newman said the time between lodging an application and allocation of the claim to a case officer had been between seven and nine weeks.

The chief executive of the National Council for Single Mothers and their Children, Terese Edwards, told Guardian Australia reassessments were “often not made within 90 days”.

“Single mothers reliant on child support – and 90% of payees are women – often straddle the poverty line and struggle to keep their families afloat,” she said.

Delayed payments could mean parents could not afford to pay for school activities or delayed medical treatment for children, Edwards said.

“There’s also an emotional component – while they are waiting for child support assessments, they are still at the mercy and control of their former partner.”

Edwards said single mothers often would not go through with the reassessment, even where they had a legitimate claim, because the process was too long and difficult.

The Department of Human Services general manager, Hank Jongen, denied that it takes seven to nine weeks to allocate a case, and said that “on average a change of assessment is completed within 60 days”.

“The department assigns and processes assessments as quickly as possible.

“It requires exchange of information between both parents who are party to a child support case, investigation of information provided by both parents, which often includes seeking verification of this information from third parties.”

On 21 March and again on Friday, the DHS declined to say what the average time to allocate reassessments to case officers is.

Responding to a freedom of information request for the information, DHS refused on Friday to release reports containing average or minimum wait times, claiming that to do so would release confidential information and would cause a “surge” of inquiries about delays.

Centrelink recipient's data released by department to counter public criticism Read more

According to the department, four weekly reports on changes of assessment were within scope but it refused to provide them because they “contain information about specific change of assessment applications”.

No reason was given as to why the department could not redact confidential information including data that would identify specific applications, while still allowing release of average wait times.

It said releasing wait times would have a “substantial adverse effect” on its operations because it “could reasonably be expected to create a surge in enquiries to the department regarding timeframes for processing [changes of assessment]”.

“[Changes of assessment], and their outcomes, have a substantial effect on the day-to-day lives of applicants, including determining how much, if any, child support they are liable to pay,” it said.

“Therefore, I am satisfied that release of information about processing timeframes could reasonably be expected to lead to increased enquiries from members of the public.”

Edwards believes the child support reassessment process should be simplified, including by creating a fast-tracked process for straightforward changes such as claiming private school fees or orthodontic costs, which should not require resubmission of income and other information.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/30/observer-view-of-future-of-israel-and-palestine,"It has long been considered axiomatic, at least on Europe’s political left, that Palestine lies at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict and that lasting peace in the Middle East depends, first and foremost, on resolution of this decades-old struggle. In recent years, such thinking has been overtaken by events. The problem has been sidelined. Yet as the region approaches the 50th anniversary of the six-day war that left Palestinian land under permanent occupation, and as hundreds of Palestinian prisoners begin their third week on hunger strike in Israeli jails, fears of a new intifada are growing. It is time to refocus attention on this dangerous stalemate before it again explodes into open, violent confrontation.

Wife of jailed Fatah leader tells of her fears for hunger strikers Read more

It is not as though the plight of the Palestinians has been forgotten or that the threats Israelis face have suddenly diminished. It is that, in the total absence of progress towards a settlement, other events have taken precedence. One is the spread of Islamist fundamentalism, principally in the form of al-Qaida and Isis. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the US redirected energy and resources towards Iraq and Afghanistan. The Arab spring revolts of 2011 also shifted the spotlight away from Palestine and on to the grievances of Arab citizens towards their own governments. Shaky Arab regimes discovered shared interests with Israel that outweighed old loyalties to the Palestinians.

Syria’s civil war has encompassed all these noxious elements – jihadi extremism, popular insurrection, governmental repression, military atrocities and social breakdown, leading to massive refugee outflows and humanitarian emergencies. Set against this enormous conflict, drawing in Russia, Iran and religious fanatics from both sides of the Sunni-Shia divide, the Palestinian problem has paled by comparison. The west’s chronic indecision over Syria, highlighted last week by Boris Johnson’s irresponsible and foolish remarks about British military action, underscores how little faith should be placed in its determination to secure a Palestinian deal.

It would be wrong to suggest the US and others have stopped trying. John Kerry, former secretary of state, pushed hard to revive the moribund peace process. The French hosted an international conference in January to promote a two-state solution, still the only workable way forward. The meeting’s final statement called on Israel to withdraw to its 1967 borders and relinquish control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as required by UN resolutions, and appealed to both parties to “abstain from unilateral actions” that could jeopardise future negotiations.

Such self-evidently sensible appeals, heard so many times before, are futile unless backed by active measures to persuade and coerce the main players. These are currently lacking. In Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel has a confrontational prime minister whose narrow, inflexible vision of what best assures Israel’s security is itself a danger to the country he serves. In Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinians have a weak, ineffective leader whose authority is undermined by Hamas. Neither man is a credible partner for peace. Neither seems to have a viable plan for ending the impasse. When Abbas meets Donald Trump in Washington this week, perhaps he will surprise us. Perhaps Trump will have something constructive to say. Or not.

Trump is correct about one thing. Speaking last week, he declared there was “no reason” why Israelis and Palestinians should not live in peace. And, in plain terms, if both sides are prepared to compromise – and possible compromises on land, borders, security, refugees and Jerusalem have been rehearsed – Trump is right. What is needed, and is lacking, is brave, imaginative leadership.

Despite his violent history, Marwan Barghouti, organiser of the prison hunger strike, is regarded by many Palestinians as one of their most able leaders. Many outsiders who wish Israel well also share that opinion and would like to see him take a more active public role, freed from his prison shackles. Barghouti’s recent op-ed in the New York Times likened the Palestinian struggle to independence movements in South Africa and elsewhere. One thing they all shared, he suggested, was the inevitability of ultimate victory. Palestinians, he wrote, were engaged in “a long walk to freedom”.

Barghouti is no Nelson Mandela. But neither can his claims and those of his people be indefinitely deferred. Trying to do so risks another explosion – another nakba – that, for all the wrong reasons, would again place Palestine at the forefront of Middle East woes.

“Single mothers reliant on child support – and 90% of payees are women – often straddle the poverty line and struggle to keep their families afloat,” she said.

Delayed payments could mean parents could not afford to pay for school activities or delayed medical treatment for children, Edwards said.

“There’s also an emotional component – while they are waiting for child support assessments, they are still at the mercy and control of their former partner.”

Edwards said single mothers often would not go through with the reassessment, even where they had a legitimate claim, because the process was too long and difficult.

The Department of Human Services general manager, Hank Jongen, denied that it takes seven to nine weeks to allocate a case, and said that “on average a change of assessment is completed within 60 days”.

“The department assigns and processes assessments as quickly as possible.

“It requires exchange of information between both parents who are party to a child support case, investigation of information provided by both parents, which often includes seeking verification of this information from third parties.”

On 21 March and again on Friday, the DHS declined to say what the average time to allocate reassessments to case officers is.

Responding to a freedom of information request for the information, DHS refused on Friday to release reports containing average or minimum wait times, claiming that to do so would release confidential information and would cause a “surge” of inquiries about delays.

According to the department, four weekly reports on changes of assessment were within scope but it refused to provide them because they “contain information about specific change of assessment applications”.

No reason was given as to why the department could not redact confidential information including data that would identify specific applications, while still allowing release of average wait times.

It said releasing wait times would have a “substantial adverse effect” on its operations because it “could reasonably be expected to create a surge in enquiries to the department regarding timeframes for processing [changes of assessment]”.

“[Changes of assessment], and their outcomes, have a substantial effect on the day-to-day lives of applicants, including determining how much, if any, child support they are liable to pay,” it said.

“Therefore, I am satisfied that release of information about processing timeframes could reasonably be expected to lead to increased enquiries from members of the public.”

Edwards believes the child support reassessment process should be simplified, including by creating a fast-tracked process for straightforward changes such as claiming private school fees or orthodontic costs, which should not require resubmission of income and other information.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/28/tories-imperial-vision-post-brexit-trade-deal-disruptive-deluded,"Top official slams Whitehall notion of colonial-style trade deals and says devising pact between UK and African, Caribbean and Pacific states would take six years

The head of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of nations has ruled out a free trade deal with the UK until at least six years after Brexit and taken a sideswipe at the idea of a new British trade empire.



The ACP chief, Dr Patrick Gomes, condemned “reactionary” Whitehall talk of a second era of British colonialism – dubbed “Empire 2.0” – and poured scorn on the government’s trade strategy.

A six-year delay to any post-Brexit deal would be a bitter setback to the government, which had hoped to use the 2018 Commonwealth summit in London as a springboard for closer trade ties with Anglophone states such as South Africa, Nigeria and Jamaica.



Gomes said: “Any trade deal would take a very long time. A transition period of at least six years would be necessary and, within that, you can’t introduce uncertainty to traders and exporters in an abrupt manner.”

Empire 2.0 is dangerous nostalgia for something that never existed | David Olusoga Read more

He said that it had taken six years for his home country, Guyana, and other Caribbean states to negotiate a trade pact with the EU and that it would be “very disruptive” to push for a deal with the UK within two years of a formal Brexit.

Informal UK-ACP trade talks have already begun, with a focus on non-tariff barriers and regulatory harmonisation, and the Department of International Trade is considering a joint working group.

But the mood has been soured by reported comments from Whitehall officials about an “Empire 2.0” trade strategy. “This is in our view reactionary, trying to recreate what we’ve gone beyond,” Gomes said.

Barry Gardiner, Labour’s shadow international trade spokesman, said the warning from Gomes should send a shockwave through Whitehall. “It exposes the anger and offence that is caused by the Tories’ deluded imperial vision of trade,” he said. “The government must stop acting like a neo-colonial power that picks and chooses when and how to engage with the world.”

A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade said: “The UK enjoys strong trading relationships with many developing countries, including in Africa. This is why the EU exit white paper confirmed in February that we are seeking to achieve continuity in these relationships.”

Theresa May’s pledge to continue earmarking 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid may have partly smoothed ruffled feathers. But questions persist over changes to the way aid is being defined.

Gomes said changes would be “lamentable – and are already beginning”. He said Brexit posed “very serious” dangers to the EU’s current levels of aid spending, which run until 2020.

The UK currently contributes €4.5bn (£3.8bn) to the EU’s European Development Fund – 15% of the total – and Brussels is offering no guarantees that Britain’s input will be replaced. The money has been spent on projects including infrastructure that counteracts coastal erosion in Guyana’s capital, Georgetown, which is below sea level.

Gomes called on May to continue the UK’s “moral obligation” to aid spending.



“We’d like to see that money managed in a mutually beneficial way, not a handout or a picking and choosing where you see an opportunity for your benefit,” he said.

ACP states fear that the UK may be angling for what Gomes called “quasi-protectionist” bilateral deals with selected countries, after Brexit.



These would almost certainly offer worse terms than the current economic partnership agreements, which are more generous than the World Trade Organisation’s “most favoured nation” status arrangement.

ACP and Commonwealth countries fear that the UK may push them to favoured nation standing, triggering a “double impact” of higher tariffs on their exports, and greater competition in the UK market.

A recent report by the Commonwealth’s Ramphal Institute said that Brexit posed “serious threats to ACP economic interests, which should not be underestimated or ignored”.",guardian.com,False

Caught in a complex war driven by inequality, narco trafficking and territorial control, most Colombians have never experienced peacetime. A conflict that spanned half a century, and was played out between paramilitaries, the government and Farc rebels, caused a huge death toll and displaced close to 7 million people.

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/27/mps-call-on-priti-patel-to-increase-uk-aid-spending-on-global-learning-crisis,"Parliamentary committee takes aim at ‘shameful neglect’ of schoolchildren in poor countries as development secretary is urged to devote more funding

MPs have urged Priti Patel to spend more of the overseas aid budget on education, in order to tackle a “global learning crisis”.

There has been a “clear decline” in foreign aid spending on education since 2011, lagging behind the outlay on health disaster, government and civil society, the international development committee said. At the culmination of a nine-month inquiry, the committee called on the UK to raise the amount of foreign aid spent on education by 2%.

British support for global education currently stands at £526million, 8% of the Department for International Development’s (DfID) allocated budget.

In a letter to Patel, the international development secretary, the committee said it had heard evidence that the average annual expenditure for each child in low- and middle-income countries was less than $10 (£7.79). The MPs said this figure represented the combined spending of all aid agencies.

Poorest countries hit hardest as world lags behind on global education goals Read more

The committee questioned DfID’s support for low-fee private schools in countries like Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo “The evidence presented to us during the inquiry certainly suggests that the majority of low-fee private schools are not serving the poorest and most marginalised children, which is where DfID’s focus should certainly be,” the MPs said.

They added that there was as yet little evidence to prove that, once a child’s social background was accounted for, such schools produce better learning outcomes than government schools. Investments in private schools should only be made on an “exceptional” basis, the committee said.



The proportion of the global humanitarian budget spent on education is 1.8%, well short of the globally agreed target of 4% (pdf).

The MPs noted the leading role played by the UK, which remains one of the biggest donors to global education. They commended the “extraordinary support” shown by DfID to allow Syrian refugees access to education in Jordan and Lebanon, but contrasted that with the provision for refugees and internally displaced people in east Africa.

The UK aid strategy “fails to place enough emphasis on ensuring all children across the developing world have access to quality education”, which remained a “pipe dream” for millions of marginalised children – particularly girls, disabled children and refugees – said the committee. Unicef, the UN children’s agency, estimated that 90% of disabled children in developing countries do not attend school (pdf).

Stephen Twigg, the committee’s chairman, said: “More than 250 million children and young people are currently out of school and another 330 million are in school but not learning. There is a global learning crisis.



“Even though we know the benefits of education, there is not enough funding from the international community to deliver this, particularly in the low-income countries which need most support. National governments in low- and middle-income countries should also be investing in their education systems.

“Currently, we are leaving millions of children behind, deprived of an education. We must take action to ensure the most marginalised children can go to school.”

Twigg said the forthcoming G7 and G20 summits will afford DfID the chance to take a global lead on education. He urged the department to stand up for the most vulnerable.

The committee criticised the international community as having “shamefully neglected” education, particularly in emergencies, and said the UK should use its influence with donors and governments to ensure more funding, particularly in low-income countries.

In order to meet the global education agenda established by the sustainable development goals, the education commission estimates funding would need to rise from $1.2tn to $3tn a year by 2030.

The letter, published on Thursday in lieu of a full report because of the June election, welcomed the government’s recommitment to the overseas aid target of 0.7% of gross national income. However, the committee expressed concern that, during evidence sessions, DfID ministers were unable to reassure MPs that the current education budget would not be cut.

The MPs suggested a budget of 10% for education spending could be met by “slowing the pace of allocation of aid to other government departments”.

Organisations such as the Malala Fund, set up by campaigner and Nobel prizewinner Malala Yousafzai, are calling for the education budget to be raised to 15% of all UK funding.

Charlie Matthews, ActionAid’s head of advocacy, said it was vital that Britain maintained its tradition of supporting the education of women and girls: “Education is the key to a girl’s future, from learning the skills she needs to earn money, to gaining the knowledge to protect herself from disease or exploitation – education gives girls the power to make decisions about their own life.”

A DfID spokesperson said: “The UK is a global leader in education. Our commitment to providing the world’s most vulnerable young people with access to school is evident in our results: we are proud to have supported over 11 million children in primary and lower secondary education from 2011-2015, including over 5.3 million girls.”

Meanwhile, MPs and peers have expressed disappointment at the government’s response to a critical inquiry on the secretive £1bn conflict, stability and security fund. The joint committee on the national security strategy, which has called into question the transparency, leadership and accountability of the fund, said that while it had forced the government to recognise the need for greater parliamentary scrutiny of the fund, insufficient information had been provided to allow such scrutiny.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/26/human-toll-abortion-afghanistan,"When Maryam had an abortion, her husband beat and humiliated her. Her story is not unusual in Afghanistan, yet illegal, unsafe terminations are on the rise

As a newlywed, Maryam’s husband promised to let her finish her university degree. Then she got pregnant, and everything changed.

“For a week, I was in shock. If my husband’s family knew I was pregnant, they would never let me finish university,” Maryam said.

So she acted promptly. She found a midwife willing to perform a surgical abortion, selling jewellery from her dowry to raise the required 250,000 afghanis (£2,900).

At the clinic, something went wrong. Maryam ended up in hospital where she awoke to find her husband shouting angrily: “Why did you do this? Why did you kill my child?”

The punishment started as soon as she was discharged. In Afghan society, abortion is seen as a blot on a family’s honour; Maryam’s husband defended his by beating her viciously and shaving her head.

Trump funding cuts would imperil tens of thousands of women, activists warn Read more

“To show I was a whore,” she said.

Maryam’s story is not uncommon. Abortions in Afghanistan are severely stigmatised, and rarely legal. Yet, according to health workers, the number of Afghan women resorting to illegal, unsafe abortions is consistently growing, partly due to an increased number of trained midwives in the country.

One sign that abortions are becoming more widespread is the price, which has dropped since Maryam had her abortion four years ago. Clinics now charge15-20,000 afghanis for a surgical procedure, while a medical abortion costs about 6,000. For young, often unemployed women it is a hefty but not always ruinous fee.

Karima had been a nurse in Kabul’s Karte Se district for three months before she discovered what went on in the clinic’s closed-off rooms.

At first, she was ridden with guilt. One particular memory, of flushing a four-month-old foetus down the toilet, still haunts her. But, she says, she discovered that abortions save more lives than they take.

“The honour of these girls is more important than religion. If I don’t do anything for her, it will be shameful for her family. They might kill her,” Karima said.

Among those who come to Karima’s clinic for abortions are single women with boyfriends, wives with drug-addicted husbands, and couples too poor to care for a child.

The honour of these girls is more important than religion Karima, nurse, Kabul

“If they were legal, abortions would be much safer,” she said. “Sometimes I’m afraid the police will find out. But I am happy to help save the honour of the girls, especially those who are not married.”

Another midwife, Laila, said abortions have become more commonplace in recent years. She said she has performed more than 50.

“Sometimes I feel guilty; when the babies are over five months old,” Laila said.

In Afghanistan, abortions are legal to save a mother’s life or if the child will be born with severe disabilities. In rare instances, women can also get an abortion if deemed too poor to raise a child. That judgment is up to a religious council.

Perhaps surprisingly, councils in Taliban-controlled areas are most likely to justify an abortion based on poverty, said Farhad Javid, country director for Marie Stopes International, the leading post-abortion care provider in Afghanistan. Communities under Taliban influence are often desperately poor and burdened with large numbers of children, Javid said.

His charity recently launched Afghanistan’s first advert for post-abortion care in Afghanistan.

Marie Stopes International, along with organisations such as the Afghan Family Guidance Association, an affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, provides post-abortion care only for women who undergo legal procedures in government clinics.

Marie Stopes also trains midwives and nurses, and imports an annual haul of 100,000 Misoprostol tablets, an abortion drug available at private clinics. Misoprostol is safe to use within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy but, because it is more affordable than a surgical procedure, many women will use it, illegally, far beyond the recommended period.

For most women, though, the only available abortions are illegal, in private health clinics, at the hands of untrained nurses.

Afghanistan has one of the world’s highest birth rates. The number of mothers who die from pregnancy-related complications is also at the upper end of the scale.

Unsafe abortions can be hard to conceal because they often result in complications.The stigma that follows can be deadly.

“Unfortunately, [pregnant] girls can get killed by parents. If we facilitated services for them, we could save the lives of these girls,” said Javid.

I think the midwives and doctors are making a big mistake. God will never forgive them Tajwar, cleaner at a Kabul clinic

Shabana, 16, had an abortion after her brother-in-law raped her. “I am the victim, but I am a criminal,” she said.

Shabana’s sister did not believe her husband would rape her. Neither did the teenager’s parents: as punishment, they banned her from leaving the house.

Marriage is now a distant dream. Everyone knows she had an abortion. Her reputation as a non-virgin will deter most potential suitors.

“What was my crime?” Shabana said. “I am in jail, a jail my family made for me.”

Without education about contraceptives, unsafe abortions become a form of birth control. There are no precise statistics for Afghanistan but one in eight annual maternal deaths worldwide – roughly 50,000 women – is caused by unsafe abortions.

Even among staff at clinics, opposition to abortion runs deep. In one of them, Tajwar has worked for five years as a cleaner. It took her two years to discover what was actually going on. One day, a teenage girl came to the clinic, crying. After her operation, Tajwar cleaned the room and noticed a large pool of blood.

“I don’t agree with abortion. I think the midwives and doctors are making a big mistake. God will never forgive them,” she said. “I have thought about calling the police, but then I remember my young children. If I lose my job, who will take care of them?”

Despite the country’s laws, prosecution for abortion is rare. Judgment is primarily social.

Maryam was forced to sleep for seven months in a cold, unfurnished room before she was sent back to her parents. For months, she begged her husband to take her back. He refused, and remarried. Four years later, at 23, Maryam still struggles with depression, compounded by damage done to her reproductive organs by the botched abortion. She can no longer conceive.

In an era when politicians’ interactions with the public are stage-managed to the last image-obsessed detail, when meaningless slogans are all they are allowed to utter and when no candidate is allowed near any situation that might misfire, it was a rare moment.

It also encapsulated an elemental French presidential campaign pitting the anti-EU, anti-globalisation and protectionist message of far-right leader Marine Le Pen against the more business-friendly and internationalist stance of the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron.

For more than an hour on Wednesday afternoon, Macron, a former investment banker and economy minister and the frontrunner in the race for the Elysée, talked – and listened – to a crowd of angry workers at a tumble-dryer factory in Amiens, northern France, threatened with closure by June 2018.

Greeted by whistles and calls of “Marine for president” when he arrived, by the time he left Macron had, if not completely convinced his audience, at least ended the jeers – and won some respect. “I’m not sure he can truly help us,” said one striking employee. “But he tried. He was quiet and honest.”

The impromptu, at times heated exchange could not have been in greater contrast with (for example) Theresa May’s appearance in Bridgend on Tuesday, when the British prime minister delivered a brief prepared message about “strong and stable leadership” to a carefully chosen and supportive audience.

But it could yet prove significant in a campaign in which Le Pen knows that her best chance of defeating Macron will be to portray him as the elitist representative of a political class that has sold France’s workers out to globalisation.

Macron’s intervention was all the braver because it followed a brief but incendiary appearance on the same Whirlpool picket line by the Front National leader, who collected almost a third of the vote in Sunday’s first round in the region that has France’s highest unemployment rate.

As Macron was meeting union representatives from the factory, which employs 286 people, a few miles away, at the chamber of commerce in the centre of Amiens, his home town, Le Pen unexpectedly appeared on the picket line and lambasted her rival for showing “contempt” by failing to come to talk to them.

“Emmanuel Macron is with the oligarchs, with the employers,” Le Pen said. “I am where I should be, with the employees of Whirlpool who are fighting this uncontrolled globalisation, this shameful economic model – not eating petits-fours with a few representatives who only represent themselves.”

The far-right candidate shook hands and took selfies, saying later that she “solemnly pledged” to save the factory, which Whirlpool plans to relocate to Poland. If she won, it would be placed under “temporary state protection”, she said, and products made abroad by French companies taxed at 35%.

Two hours later, Macron came to debate the workers himself. Amid initial taunts, he explained that he was meeting the unions first so that he could discuss the issue with the employees properly afterwards.

Macron accused Le Pen of exploiting the situation “for political ends” and of lying when she vowed to halt the relocation. He handed the microphone to workers, listening to their questions and promising to answer truthfully.



“When she tells you the solution is to turn back globalisation, to close borders, she is lying,” he said during the exchange, which was streamed live on his Facebook page. “If she’s elected, this company will close.”

“Madame Le Pen does not understand how this country works,” he insisted. “If we shut down borders, thousands and thousands of jobs will be lost.” He cited a Procter & Gamble factory nearby, saying it exported 90% of its output.

Macron said he refused to make “airy promises” to keep the factory open, but pledged the firm’s redundancy plan would not be accepted if it was not good enough. While some continued to boo for a while, the crowd had largely calmed down by the end of the discussion. He shook hands with several workers as he left.

For the centrist candidate, who has never held elected office, the confrontation was a major risk. He was criticised on Monday after celebrating his first round win over Le Pen in a Paris brasserie with campaign staff, and the exchange outside the factory could have backfired badly.

But several commentators said Macron’s decision would end up playing in his favour. “It could be that Le Pen’s coup failed in the end by giving Macron the political thick skin he was lacking until now,” said Christian Delporte, a historian and political image specialist at the university of Versailles.

“Macron is fighting back,” said Laurent Joffrn, the editor of the left-leaning daily Libération. “By rolling up his shirt sleeves at Whirlpool, abused by furious or desperate employees who nonetheless appreciated speaking to him, he has corrected his mistake of Sunday evening.”

A tax plan released by the White House on Wednesday could deliver many millions of dollars annually in tax savings to Donald Trump personally under the guise of helping small businesses, multiple tax experts have told the Guardian.

Trump under fire over 'huge tax cut for the rich' Read more

Trump would not be alone among the super-rich to benefit from the plan, analysts said, although the structure of the Trump Organization, an agglomeration of hundreds of owner-operated entities, made it a prime potential beneficiary.

The secretive nature of the Trump Organization, which the president has not divested from, and the lack of Trump’s own tax returns to work with, made it difficult to pin down how much the president and his family could stand to gain from the tax code changes proposed on Wednesday, analysts said.



Asked on Wednesday how the tax reform plan would personally affect Trump and his family, press secretary Sean Spicer said that most Americans “should be and I think frankly” are more concerned with how it would affect them.

Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, referred the Guardian to a paper in which he wrote that, “conservatively… the Trump plan would give the 400 highest-income households a tax break of about $9m each” per year.

Dean Baker, co-founder of the nonpartisan Center for Economic and Policy Research, estimated loosely – given the dearth of information about Trump’s income, assets and tax strategy – that “the Trump tax plan will save Donald Trump $65m a year in taxes”.

The mechanism by which Trump would claim those savings would be irrelevant for most small business owners, analysts said, despite the White House billing the tax plan as “helping the low- and middle-income families who have been left behind by this economy”.

“We are going to cut taxes for businesses to make them competitive and we’re going to cut taxes for the American people, especially low- and middle-income families,” Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs, said in rolling out the plan on Wednesday.



“This is a classic kind of shell game; this is done all the time in political circles,” Baker said. “The reality is it does very little for small businesses – in most cases it does nothing for them, because they’re already paying taxes at a lower rate. So this is a way of cutting taxes for the very wealthy but hiding it as helping small businesses.”

Trump’s plan, which would have to be adopted by Congress to take effect – far from a given – would introduce a new tax rate of 15% for owner-operated businesses known as pass-throughs, which are called that because, for tax purposes, income is “passed through” from the business balance sheet to individual owners and taxed like personal income.

Earners in the top income bracket face a 39.6% hit under current law. Trump’s plan would allow the wealthy business owner who re-categorized personal income as business income to access the lower 15% rate.

Such owners potentially include the president himself. The Trump Organization last year comprised approximately 500 separate pass-through entities, in each case with Trump as the sole or principal owner, according to a statement released by his lawyers during the presidential campaign. Businesses typically run as pass-throughs include hedge funds and other investment firms, medical and legal practices, lobbying firms and real estate enterprises.

Small businesses are pass-throughs, too, but small businesses are not positioned, the way the Trump Organization would be, to score a huge tax break because most owners aren’t top earners and already pay taxes at lower rates.

“The small business is the poster child,” Marr said. “The same with the estate tax; they hold up a farmer when no farmers are affected. Because a farmer’s sympathetic and the Walton family’s not.

“The [media] coverage ignores, though, that most small businesses are small. You have a graduated rate structure. So if you don’t make much money, you don’t pay a high rate.

“Seventy percent of entities with pass-through income already pay 15%. So this doesn’t affect them. It only affects those who are at the higher rates. And that money, again, is very concentrated at the top.”

The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has estimated that changes in the way pass-through owners would pay taxes under Trump’s plan would cost the government $1.5tn over 10 years.

Scott Greenberg, a policy analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, explained the rationale behind the administration’s assertion on Wednesday that the new lower business tax in Trump’s plan was aimed at stimulating economic growth.

“The motivation behind such proposals I think comes from, number one, a desire to lower taxes on businesses generally, recognizing that investment is potentially particularly sensitive to taxes, which might provide a rationale for lowering taxes specifically on business investments,” Greenberg said.

He said that anti-abuse rules in Trump’s tax code, if it is passed by Congress, could stop some business owners from aggressively re-categorizing their income to achieve a lower tax rate.



“Certainly businesses are required to pay their owners reasonable compensation,” Greenberg said. “So if some of your income from a business is compensation for your labor services provided, under current law you are required to report that as wages and salaries rather than as business income. However, this standard hasn’t always proven robust. There’s some evidence that wealthy individuals will use the pass-through business form to re-categorize income already from wages and salaries to business income.”

Marr, by contrast, saw a potential gold rush, and not just for Trump.

“Obviously if he passed this law,” Marr said, “there’d be a lot more pass-throughs.”
