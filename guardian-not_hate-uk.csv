The European Union has called on Theresa May to provide immediate “serious and real” guarantees to its citizens living in Britain. The EU leaders took just four minutes at a special summit to agree unanimously an uncompromising opening stance in the Brexit negotiations.

Leaders said they would not discuss a future trade deal with the British government until “sufficient progress” is made on the issues of Britain’s estimated €60bn divorce bill, the rights of EU nationals in the UK, and the border in Ireland.

The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told reporters at the special summit in Brussels that EU citizens in Britain were the number one priority, and that he had discussed the need for Britain to now live up to its warm words regarding EU citizens during a dinner with the prime minister in Downing Street last week.

“We have already prepared a text that could be adopted immediately if our British friends would be willing to sign it, but that probably won’t happen,” Juncker told reporters, adding that there was an element of tragedy in the situation of some in the UK.

“I have the impression sometimes that our British friends, not all of them, do underestimate the technical difficulties we have to face,” he said, adding that May had told him, to each of his questions about the future: “Be patient and ambitious.”

Donald Tusk, president of the European council, whose members comprise the EU states, added: “For the past weeks we have heard from our British friends, also during my visit in London, that they are ready to agree on this issue quickly.

“I would like to state very clearly that we need real guarantees for our people who live, work and study in the UK and the same goes for the Brits. The commission has prepared a full list of the rights and benefits that we want to guarantee for those affected by Brexit. To achieve sufficient progress we need a serious British response.”

The two EU leaders were speaking after European leaders agreed in record time to adopt nine pages of negotiating guidelines at a special summit in Brussels.

Responding to the summit’s conclusions, David Davis, the secretary of state for exiting the European Union, said that he feared the coming talks would be “confrontational” and echoed May’s comments last week about member states “lining up to oppose us”.

He said: “Both sides are clear: we want these negotiations to be conducted in a spirit of goodwill, sincere cooperation and with the aim of establishing a close partnership between the UK and the EU going forward.

“But there is no doubt that these negotiations are the most complex the UK has faced in our lifetimes. They will be tough and at times even confrontational. There are already people in Europe who oppose these aims and people at home trying to undermine them. That is why it is so important that the UK has the right leadership in place.”

Speaking in the margins of the summit, leaders had taken turns all day to warn the British government that the EU was unified and would fight hard for the interests of its member states. The French president, François Hollande, told reporters: “There will inevitably be a price and a cost for Britain; it’s the choice they made.

“We must not be punitive, but at the same time it’s clear that Europe knows how to defend its interests, and that Britain will have a less good position outside the EU than in the EU.”

Asked about her suggestion last week that some in the UK were deluded about the coming talks, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she feared there was a lack of understanding about the EU’s resolve to only talk about trade once the opening issues had been resolved.

Merkel also appeared unconvinced by May’s claim that a landslide election victory would strengthen her negotiating position in the talks when they start in June, although she applauded the prime minister for calling it.

“The British prime minster thinks that a clear vote [in the general election] will strengthen her position in the negotiations,” she said. “It will certainly give her a very credible platform. The election has removed this sword of Damocles over the negotiations.”

Other leaders also appeared bemused by the prime minister’s claims about being empowered by an election triumph. Hollande, who is now in his last week as president, said: “That is an election argument that I can understand. But this is not an argument against the European Union. Why? Because the bases, the principles, the objectives are already fixed: these will be the lines that will be chosen by the negotiators and there will be no others.”

Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, claimed May had called the election to resolve an internal problem in the Conservative party.

She wanted “not a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit but Theresa’s Brexit,” he said. Joseph Muscat, the prime minister of Malta, added: “I wouldn’t want to intrude in the prime minister’s decisions but the fact is we are wasting one month now.”

EU leaders at the summit also agreed a declaration that would allow northern Ireland to swiftly rejoin the EU, in the event of a vote for Irish unification. With polls showing that a majority of voters in Northern Ireland want to stay part of the UK, the Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, said the clause was not about triggering a poll.

“I have always been very clear that the conditions for a referendum do not currently exist, but the endorsement of the principle, the potential agreement of the Good Friday agreement is hugely important.”

The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it was in Britain’s interests for the EU to be unified, as it would boost the chances of a Brexit deal. “This extraordinary meeting shows the unity of the 27 on a clear line, but this unity is not directed against Britain; I think that it is also in its interest,” he said.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/29/election-labour-mcdonnell-corbyn-zero-hours-economy,"Labour has pledged to ban all zero-hours contracts, put a halt to unpaid internships and end the pay cap on public sector staff in an unashamedly leftwing pitch to British workers.

In a move welcomed by union leaders but that will be attacked as “anti-business” and unaffordable by opponents, the 20-point blueprint also includes commitments to double paid paternity leave to four weeks, increase paternity pay and guarantee temporary and part-time workers the same rights as full-time employees.

The shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the policies would form “the cornerstone of the next Labour government’s programme to bring an end to the rigged economy that many experience in workplaces across Britain”. The package includes promises to increase the minimum wage to match the national living wage (expected to be at least £10 an hour by 2020) and to introduce a maximum 20:1 pay ratio between the highest and lowest earners in the public sector and in companies bidding for public sector contracts.

McDonnell said: “The scandal of six million people earning less than the living wage and four million children growing up in poverty are not inevitable. It only takes a change of government to bring these outrages to an end.”

An Opinium/Observer poll puts Labour a massive 17 points behind the Tories, on 30%, but its support has increased by four points compared with a week ago. Backing for the Tories has risen by two points to 47%, with the Lib Dems down three points to 8% and Ukip down two points to 7%.

Labour MPs will hope the appeal to working people will stem what many feared would become a drift of some traditional Labour supporters towards the Tories with less than six weeks to go before polling day on 8 June.

The manifesto for working Britain is more leftwing than that unveiled by Ed Miliband ahead of the 2015 election, which itself was criticised by the Tories and Lib Dems at the time as one of the most “anti-business” in living memory.

The 20-point blueprint aims to offer concrete measures to help those who Jeremy Corbyn says are being exploited in an increasingly unregulated economy, including workers such as couriers and delivery drivers, and the 900,000 people employed by the big high street brands and other companies on zero-hours contracts.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of the UK’s biggest union, Unite, said: “This positive platform from Labour is the antidote to the uncertainty and insecurity which plagues working life for millions in the UK.”

Unison’s general secretary Dave Prentis said: “Ending the 1% pay cap would make such a huge difference to the lives of thousands of nurses, teaching assistants, town hall staff and other public service employees whose living standards have plummeted under the Conservatives. Calling time on zero-hours contracts would come as a huge relief to the many people who have no option but to work in this precarious and wholly unsatisfactory way.”

The Communication Workers Union described the plans as “some of the most important announcements from any political party on the world of work for a generation”.

Labour has already said it will introduce four new bank holidays. McDonnell also signalled that Labour’s manifesto will pledge no rise in VAT or national insurance and he will argue the party should rule out reviving Miliband’s mansion tax policy.

The Tories will use the pledges to further question Labour’s economic credibility and ask how they can be paid for without huge tax rises or a massive increase in borrowing.

On Saturday Corbyn broke off from a campaign speech to speak about his personal history, motivations and views on leadership. In a tactic reminiscent of that employed by the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and the former Tory prime minister John Major, Corbyn said: “And now for a sentence I’ve yet to utter in my political life: ‘Enough about you, what about me?’” He recalled his maiden speech in parliament 34 years ago, the part he played in anti-apartheid protests in London and other personal memories.

Afterwards he denied it was part of a rebranding exercise but was a “one-off”. “As you know, I am very averse to talking about myself … I am not going to spend the whole election campaign talking about myself any more. So you had the chance today,” he said.

Labour strategists are keen to contrast what they portray as a cold Tory prime minister, Theresa May, with what they insist is Corbyn’s warmer personality. They are also anxious to contrast his willingness to take questions from the media with May’s refusal to take part in TV debates.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/29/trump-blames-constitution-for-first-100-days-chaos-presidency,"On his 100th day in office on Saturday, facing historically low popularity ratings, a succession of intractable foreign crises and multiple investigations of his links with Moscow, Donald Trump reminded the nation that 1 May was Loyalty Day.

The day is a US tradition dating back to the cold war, when it was a bolster to stop May Day becoming a rallying point for socialists and unionised workers, but for an embattled president learning politics on the job it has an added resonance.

In an interview with Fox News to mark the 100-day mark, he declared himself “disappointed” with congressional Republicans, despite his many “great relationships” with them.

He blamed the constitutional checks and balances built in to US governance. “It’s a very rough system,” he said. “It’s an archaic system … It’s really a bad thing for the country.”

The Loyalty Day announcement came amid a flurry of other proclamations to mark the milestone at which the early stages of American presidencies are traditionally measured. The coming seven days were named both National Charter Schools Week and Small Business Week. May has been burdened with being simultaneously: National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, Older Americans Month, Jewish American Heritage Month, National Foster Care Month, as well as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

Such announcements help a president look busy, especially at such heavily scrutinised milestones as the 100-day mark, and particularly for an inexperienced politician rapidly learning the limits of presidential power, even with a solid Republican majority in Congress.

He has failed to get any of his priorities turned into legislation in the face of party disunity, and his attempt to rule by executive order has been largely hollow. His decrees have been either meaningless, like his one-page, detail-free tax reform plan, or have been blocked by the courts, such as his travel ban for Muslim countries and refugees.

Trump’s approval ratings have remained mired at historic lows for a presidency in what is supposed to be a honeymoon period, hovering around – and frequently below – the 40% mark, well below his recent predecessors at this stage in their presidencies.

But his core supporters have remained faithful, choosing to believe that the mainstream media are purveyors of fake news, rather than accept that the Trump presidency has not been the unrivalled success the president has claimed. They have also accommodated Trump’s affinity for Vladimir Putin. The percentage of Republicans who see Russia as an unfriendly state has fallen from 82% in 2014 to 41% now, according to a CNN/ORC poll.

On his 100th day, Trump turned to this loyal base to sound off on the issue that bonds them most tightly – economic nationalism. On an otherwise leisurely Saturday, during which his only other engagement was a call with the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, the president was due to attend an evening rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where disenchanted workers defected from the Democrats in droves in the 2016 election. While visiting the town, he was also due to sign an executive order to establish an office of trade and manufacturing policy, which will help push his drive for import substitution.

In his weekly presidential address, he also focused on jobs, pointing to evidence of an economic revival that has been previously contested as a result of corporate decisions made before Trump came to office. He claimed that car companies were “roaring back in”, an apparent reference to General Motors’ plans and Ford’s decision to expand in Michigan, which both appeared to be part of their long-term strategy.

Trump also claimed that his approval of the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada would create tens of thousands of jobs. That will be true in the short term, during the construction phase, but after that keeping the pipeline going is expected to employ 35 people on a permanent basis.

The gap between the extreme bravado of Trump’s claims and the daily realities of governing has deepened public cynicism. In a new Gallup poll, just 36% declared him honest and trustworthy, down from 42% in early February. His general approval rating stood at 40%.

There is strong evidence, however, that the fact-checking of presidential claims is having a small and dwindling impact on true Trump loyalists. His support remains strong in traditional blue collar areas and evangelical strongholds, where there is more trust in the president than the mainstream media. The president has relentlessly assaulted the media, launching an attack per day on average since he took office, denouncing negative news as fake news, and there are signs the relentless offensive has inflicted wounds. One poll released on Friday found that more people trusted the White House than political journalists.

Against that background there were reports yesterday that Steve Bannon, the champion of economic and ethnic nationalism, was making a political comeback in the White House, and that he remained a bulwark of Trump’s strategy to secure his core support and win again in 2020.

His hand has been seen behind the rapid-burst issue of protectionist moves in the run up to the 100th day, picking fights with Canada over milk and softwood imports, and measures to shield the aluminium industry from foreign competition.

“All of these people who say the president doesn’t have an ideology, they’re wrong,” one unnamed Bannon ally told political news site The Hill. “He does have an ideology, and it’s Bannon’s ideology. They are just now figuring out how to implement it.”

Bannon was also said to have drafted an executive order withdrawing the US from the North American Free Trade Area (Nafta), but on Thursday Trump decided simply to issue a call for its renegotiation reportedly after having been shown a map showing it would cost the most jobs in states that had supported him in the election. The battle between countervailing factions in the Trump White House continues to ebb and flow, but the president’s reflexes in times of adversity lead him to fall back on the “America First” narrative that got him elected in the first place.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/29/anthony-joshua-beats-wladimir-klitschko-wembley-heavyweight-champion-round-11,"From the moment the final blows of a magnificent fight rippled down Anthony Joshua’s 27-year-old arms on to the bleeding and battered head of the 41-year-old Wladimir Klitschko in the 11th round, there could be no more arguments about who is the best heavyweight in the world.

It was not just that Joshua, unbeaten in all 19 professional fights, had added the WBA “super” version of the title to his own IBF belt, or even that he had stopped one of boxing’s finest old champions. What secured the winner’s acclaim, surely, by everyone but the WBC champion, Deontay Wilder (who sat ringside) was that he got up from a right cross in the sixth that would have felled an elephant. Probably unsure what city he was in, he fought on through a daze to bring the contest to the most dramatic conclusion, and will rule until someone of equal stature unseats him. There is nobody of that calibre on the horizon.

Anthony Joshua beats Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley – in pictures Read more

There was little in it as they came out for the 11th round. Klitschko, perhaps, had an edge, using every trick garnered over 68 fights, 29 of them as champion in an 11-year stretch, to bring anxiety to his young opponent’s work. That changed in the crack of a single uppercut to the Ukrainian’s jaw, which all but toppled him. A left hook and a grazing right put him down for a count in his own corner and Joshua went for the kill, calmly and with fixed purpose. He sent him over like a dead tree with a left hook, yet somehow Klitschko got up for more.

When Joshua moved in with rapacious instincts to let loose that volley of pain in his own corner, his trainer, Robert McCracken, was screaming himself hoarse – along with the rest of the stadium.

Joshua celebrated in the ring with a message that sounded like a recruiting call for all the lost youth he likes to represent: “If you don’t take part, you fail. Boxing is about character. There is nowhere to hide. No complications about boxing. Anyone can do this. Give it a go. You leave your ego at the door. Massive respect to Klitschko. He’s a role model in and out of the ring and I’ve got nothing but love and respect for anyone who steps in the ring. London, I love you. Can I go home now?”

The response from the 90,000 present was rapturous – as it was for Klitschko when he took the microphone to acknowledge: “The best man won. It’s really sad I didn’t make it tonight. But all respect to Anthony.”

In the 10 minutes or so Klitschko had to wait in the ring while the champion sashayed through the crowd, the Ukrainian bounced to Joshua’s music. He did not dance to his tune for all of the fight but Joshua had his measure when it mattered.

Joshua had to call up all the things he had learned – about boxing off the lines, moving in and out, waiting for gaps – but Klitschko had that hard-wired already. He had 50 fights on the young champion, and 14 years. Still, the mutual respect of the buildup carried over to the combat, and neither man took early risks.

Klitschko, always marginally fancier than his elder brother Vitali, got up on his toes and moved into hitting range in the third, looking to pressure his opponent, but Joshua kept his shape and composure.

The challenger opened the fourth with a long right that caught Joshua off-guard, before settling back into his counterpuncher’s rhythm. Against lesser opponents, he has always been prepared to wait for openings but, in his latter years, he has pulled the trigger less often when those opportunities have presented themselves. So it was in the fourth, which he let slip by.

The fight properly came to life in the fifth. Joshua, stirred after being shaken, hammered Klitschko with a welter of rights and lefts and sent him down at his feet for a count. But in a dramatic and swift turnaround, Klitschko shot back an uppercut, staggering Joshua to the point of near collapse. It is astonishing that he returned to his corner smiling. He had survived and got the round for the knockdown.

The old and former champion now had blood and fire in his eyes. Both had tasted the other man’s power. Both were wary, but game nonetheless for a tear-up if it came. Joshua was still looking for his legs when Klitschko produced a crackerjack right in the sixth, delivered flush on his slack jaw, and down he sailed. The stadium held its breath. Somehow, Joshua rose on feet that a drunk would have rejected, and he was still there at the end of the sixth.

Joshua seemed to be moving in a daze still but then started talking to the Ukrainian midway through the seventh, as if to test the fire again. “Come on!” he said. Klitschko’s round.

Joshua looked livelier in the eighth, keen to renew high-grade hostilities. Klitschko now had the right hand cocked constantly but the seconds ticked by without a launch. Joshua jolted his head back with jabs, his concentration and confidence just about restored, to edge the round.

Klitschko was still living off the success of the sixth, it seemed, as they shared the ninth. In the 10th, he reverted to type and tied up his man at every opportunity, no doubt imagining he could now manage the fight all the way to the final bell.

The only bells ringing for Klitschko, however, were those in his head in the 11th, probably the most horrendous of his long and garlanded career. He was a proud not bitter loser, a champion to the end.

Asked while his head was still spinning if he would contemplate a rematch, he said, quite reasonably: “Of course I’m interested but first I’ve got to work out what the hell happened.”

What happened was he lost to a fighter who can now fairly claim to be the biggest star in the business. Not that he would, mind.

Undercard report

Luke Campbell is only a signature away from a world title fight with the outstanding WBA lightweight champion, Jorge Linares, after a convincing ninth-round stoppage of Darleys Pérez on Saturday night. “I’ve been watching him my whole career and he’s a great champion,” Campbell said of the Venezuelan standing next to him after the fight. “I would love that fight.”

Linares, who has checked the world title ambitions of Kevin Mitchell and Anthony Crolla, will provide another level altogether for Campbell, who has had five good wins since his only defeat in 18 paid bouts, against Yvan Mendy in 2015.

This undercard fight was a classic cat-and-mouse affair between two skilful and quick-fisted boxers, Campbell’s educated southpaw style interlocking with the that of the orthodox Pérez with surprising smoothness.

The Colombian, who boxed a close draw then lost to Crolla, arrived at only three weeks’ notice and did not make the 9st 9lb limit, however, so was boxing for the purse and pride. The latter remained intact until he turned away in pain after throwing a half-jab, clutching his left arm, and was retired in the eighth.

Another garlanded Olympic champion, Katie Taylor, one of the outstanding amateurs of her time and a beacon for women’s boxing, looks more like a professional with every fight and edged closer to a world title when she imposed a seventh-round stoppage on her fifth opponent, the unbeaten Nina Meinke.

The German, smaller but as determined as the 30-year-old Dubliner, had also had only a handful of contests, but the win has earned Taylor a shot at the WBA belt, probably in June or July, according to her promoter, Eddie Hearn. She will take the organisation’s inter-continental belt to the negotiating table with her.

Scott Quigg, with Freddie Roach newly installed in his corner, kept his world title hopes burning and brought a few of the Wild Card frills back with him in pounding out a comprehensive win over Viorel Simion, a 35-year-old Romanian whose only defeat in a long career came in Hull four years ago against Lee Selby.

The Bury featherweight, a former world champion at super-bantam, will now chase a shot at the winner of Léo Santa Cruz and Abner Mares. A rematch with Carl Frampton is on the horizon.

Similar in stature and hard-jawed features, Quigg and Simion could have been mistaken for brothers from the cheap seats as they set to, but the gnarled visitor looked more like Quigg’s grandfather by the end.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/france-election-neofascism-le-pen-macron,"At the university of Paris Nanterre, on the outskirts of the French capital, Antoine Guerreiro of the union of communist students was handing out leaflets urging students to vote for Emmanuel Macron in the final round of the presidential election next Sunday.

Or, to be strictly accurate, to vote against the Front National’s Marine Le Pen. Guerreiro can find very little – if anything – to support in Macron’s programme, but needs must. The alternative is worse.

“On Sunday night, we were all shaken, but now we must carry on without denying our ideals; and one of our strongest ideals is to oppose the far right in all circumstances,” Geurreiro, 19, said. “It’s clear.”

The students are opposing the “ni-ni” (neither-nor) option of abstaining, voting blank or spoiling the ballot paper. Others call it the “ni patrie, ni patron” choice, a rejection of Le Pen’s nationalism and Macron’s support of bankers and bosses.

The leaflet in Guerreiro’s hand said: “After a campaign marked by scandal, neoliberalism and the extreme right … it would be tempting not to turn out for the second round. However, it would not be sensible to let the extreme right run our country.”

The former Socialist mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, told RTL radio he would follow his party’s call to vote for Macron, reminding listeners: “Hitler was elected by universal suffrage. I don’t want to make anyone feel guilty. I’m calling for responsibility, conscience … and generosity. At this given moment we have to put France before our old resentments.”

The conservative Les Républicains party, whose presidential candidate François Fillon was defeated in the first round, has also called for an electoral “barrage” against Le Pen, though some in its traditional Catholic right wing have drifted to the far right.

Even Macron’s arch-nemesis, sheep farmer José Bové, the European ecologist MP and anti-globalisation militant famous for once dismantling a McDonalds restaurant, said he would vote for the En Marche! candidate “without ambiguity or hesitation”. Bové said he had no time for “leftwing purists” like the hard-left firebrand, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. But where was Mélenchon, charismatic leader of La France Insoumise (the France Unbowed) movement? And what would he advise his seven million voters to do?

To refuse to choose between a banker and a fascist is an affront to democracy and history Read more

As the clamour for Mélenchon to speak last week grew, his team said that he was not “a guru” and would not be telling anyone how to vote, while insisting that a vote for Marine Le Pen was “not an option”.

With the question of whether to vote and how causing anguish and anger in equal measure among the hardline French left, for whom Macron is unpalatable and Le Pen beyond the political pale. Jean-Yves Camus, a political analyst with the left-leaning Jean Jaurès foundation and expert on the far right, said waverers needed to be clear in their minds what is at stake.

“This is a choice of civilisation. It’s not a choice between two different programmes or two different political figures. Let’s be completely honest, this is the choice between two kinds of France. That is what’s at stake,” Camus said.

Comparisons with 2002, when the FN founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, knocked out the Socialist party candidate, Lionel Jospin, in the first round of the presidential election, are misleading. The 2002 result was a shock to France and Le Pen himself; he had no credible programme and no real ambition to be president. And in the second round, France voted massively for the conservative Jacques Chirac.

Today no one doubts Marine Le Pen’s will to win. Camus warned that, despite the younger Le Pen’s attempts to clean up the FN’s racist, Holocaust-denying image, the difference between her and her father in political terms was purely cosmetic. “If you listen closely, the words are different, but the policies are the same. Jean-Marie Le Pen said ‘France for the French’, Marine Le Pen says ‘France first’ and her supporters chant: ‘This is our home’,” Camus told a meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association. “We have no choice; we have to stop Le Pen. The spectre of neofascism is still there.”

And he added: “We will probably hear many nasty things in the coming week; nasty stuff about Macron being a former Rothschild banker, for example.”

Harry Bernas, a retired physicist and Mélenchon supporter, said he would be voting Macron because “the danger of abstaining is too great. There is something temporarily irreversible about having Le Pen come to power.

“Thanks to Jean-Luc Mélenchon people have begun thinking there’s another way out of this crisis of poverty, unemployment, despair. The real question is how to vote to keep that going. In my mind it will be easier to continue the fight under Macron than Le Pen, who is more dangerous,” said Bernas.

Joseline Frommer, 68, a former legal assistant and one-time Socialist supporter who also voted for Mélenchon in the first round, admitted she was in the “ni-ni” camp and will vote blank unless the final opinion polls on Friday show that Le Pen could win.

“It’s impossible for me to vote for Le Pen, but a vote for Macron? If I do and he has a huge majority, I think it will make me physically sick. But it’s true, we cannot take the risk of Le Pen winning,” she said.

In Le Monde, Gérard Miller, a psychoanalyst and writer, said Mélenchon supporters like himself were not going to take “moral lessons in anti-fascism”.

“That Macron is today a temporary, very temporary alas, rampart against the Front National, I can admit because I’m going to vote for the leader of En Marche!, but only if we’re going to be lucid: in terms of fighting the far right, nothing, starting with his programme and his past, goes in favour of the former economy minister,” Miller wrote.

Latest polling suggests only 40% of Mélenchon voters will vote for Macron, 45% will abstain, while 15% will vote for Le Pen. On Friday, Mélenchon broke his self-imposed silence to announce he would be voting, but how was between him and the ballot box. This week his campaign team will present the result of a consultation of 450,000 supporters, “Les Insoumis” (the Unbowed), on three choices: to abstain, vote blank or vote for Macron. Mélenchon’s spokesman, Alexis Corbière, said none of the three options for the second round run-off was “immoral”.

Before then, there could be a repeat of last week clashes between police and “anti-fascist” protesters as demonstrators take to the streets across France for the traditional May Day workers’ marches. On Twitter, the #JeVoteMacron (I’m voting Macron) versus the #SansMoiLe7mai (Without me on 7 May), vote or abstain battle continues.

Whatever happens next Sunday, Harry Bernas says the crisis in France is “so bad, so deep and the need for change so great” that the country is at boiling point. “It’s what we physicists call first order transition; when you heat water there’s a change you hardly see just before it turns into vapour, that fluctuation, the agitation around the edge, we’re at that stage, and I think there’s very little chance it will be a subtle, kind or friendly transition.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/29/nhs-nurses-pay-cut-12-per-cent-over-decade,"NHS workers will have had their pay cut by 12% by the end of the decade because of a government-imposed wage restraint that is now exacerbating chronic understaffing, new research reveals.

The 625,000 health service staff who earn at least £22,000 will have seen their income fall by 12% between 2010-11 and 2020-21 as a result of years of below-inflation 0% and 1% pay rises eroding their spending power, according to a report by the Health Foundation thinktank

The real-terms drop in pay will hit NHS personnel across the UK who are on band five or above in the service’s pay scales, which includes all 315,000 nurses. The Royal College of Nursing’s 270,000 members are currently being polled on whether they should strike – for the first time in their history – in protest at the government holding down their pay by limiting rises to 1% every year until 2020.

Staff salaries have already been cut by 6% since the coalition came to power in 2010, more than the 2% seen across the economy as a whole in that time, the report found. Midwives have seen their pay shrink by 6%, but doctors and health visitors have been hit by 8% and 12% drops respectively.

The Health Foundation also found that England could face a shortfall of 42,000 nurses by 2020, and almost half of all nurses believe that current staffing levels are already dangerously stretched.

Staff pay has fallen back so much that it is now causing major problems, the thinktank said. “The current phase of national NHS pay bill control began at a time of economic recession, with low inflation and high unemployment.

NHS pay caps have gone as far as they can, but are no longer sustainable and should be replaced, argued the thinktank: “The need for staffing growth, internal skills shortages, the search for productivity improvements, the ageing of the NHS workforce, and external labour market changes and unknowns – for example, the impact of Brexit on NHS staffing – all point to the need to better align the total reward package of NHS staff with organisational priorities.”

The likelihood of inflation being around 2-3% and workers generally receiving 3% pay rises means NHS staff’s earnings will continue to decline, the thinktank believes. “This means that NHS pay is likely to continue to reduce relative to both inflation and the wider economy over the period. Health unions said the findings vindicated their warnings that wage control had been applied for so long that it was prompting staff to quit and potential recruits to choose to pursue other careers.

“Nurses should not have to fund the NHS deficit from their own pay packets. Every year that the government holds NHS pay below inflation, hundreds of thousands of nurses get another real-terms cut to their salary. Too many are struggling to make ends meet, turning to food banks and hardship grants in desperation,” said Janet Davies, the RCN’s chief executive and general secretary.

The government pay cap is fuelling a recruitment and retention crisis that is also damaging patient care, she said. “A growing number feel they can no longer afford to work in the profession and others are deterred from joining by the meagre pay on offer.”

She called on Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, to scrap the 1% pay cap that the government has already said it intends to impose on public-sector workers until 2020. The NHS has about 25,000 nursing vacancies lying unfilled across the UK, especially in hospitals, the RCN estimates.

Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation, said: “By 2019, people working for the NHS will have had their pay capped for nine consecutive years. The result is that earnings will have fallen by at least 12% over a decade when accounting for inflation. The NHS doesn’t have enough nurses and is struggling to retain staff. As earnings across the economy pick up, the government can’t continue to hold down pay indefinitely and secure the workforce the NHS needs.”

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/29/mps-demand-action-on-10bn-food-waste,"Supermarket “best before” labels could be phased out while shops should be forced to sell oddly shaped vegetables under proposals from MPs who have warned the government it needs to do more to tackle food waste.

More than £10bn worth of food is thrown away by households each year, according to a damning report from the environment, food and rural affairs select committee.

The committee, whose report Food Waste in England is published on Sunday, said the government should set an “ambitious” national reduction target to cut food waste, which costs the average person £200 a year. Raising awareness of food waste from a young age should be a priority and the government should examine how lessons on food and avoiding waste can be incorporated into the school curriculum, they said.

“Socially, it is a scandal that people are going hungry and using food banks when so much produce is being wasted,” said Neil Parish, chair of the committee. “And environmentally it is a disaster, because energy and resources are wasted in production only for the food to end up rotting in landfills where it produces methane – a potent climate-changing gas.”

The report says supermarkets should be forced to publish data on the amount of food they bin. The MPs commended Tesco for already publishing this information and praised Sainsbury’s for moving in the same direction. However, they said retailers should increase the amount of surplus food they give away to charities – instead of binning so much – and should also improve their packaging, for example by using more resealable packets.

In addition, the incoming government has been urged to continue with a review on food date labelling, looking particularly at whether there is a need for “best before” dates which can confuse people.

The committee expressed its dismay at the trend for supermarkets to sell only perfectly shaped vegetables and fruit. “It’s ridiculous that perfectly good vegetables are wasted simply because they’re a funny shape,” said Parish. “Farmers supplying fruits and vegetables to UK supermarkets currently get their produce rejected on the grounds that it fails to meet cosmetic quality standards set by the big retailers. Knobbly carrots and parsnips don’t cook or taste any different. It’s high time we saved them from the supermarket reject bins.”

Parish said the government should set a national target for food waste reduction in England, as Scotland, the US and European countries do. It was also essential that waste reduction body Wrap, which has seen its funding cut despite its success in reducing food waste through voluntary agreements, has sufficient money to maintain its efforts, he said.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/29/vince-cable-cash-strapped-councils-at-risk-credit-bubble,"Desperate councils risk being plunged into an Icelandic-style financial crisis after investing £1.5bn in the commercial property market, according to Sir Vince Cable, former business secretary.

Heavy cuts in central government funding have left the authorities having to consider increasingly exotic solutions to ease their financial constraints.

Between 2010 and 2015, there was a 37% cut in real terms in central government funding to local authorities. One option – popular in the last couple of years – has been to borrow from the Treasury-run Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) at very low rates of interest and then use the money to invest in commercial property ventures that offer returns of as much as 8%.

But there are fears that the strategy is creating a bubble that could bankrupt some local authorities. “This is not a wise and sensible thing to do,” said Cable, who was business secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition and is standing as Lib Dem candidate in his former seat in Twickenham, south-west London.

“Local authorities have a long and inglorious history of gambling in financial and property markets,” he said. In the 1980s, Hammersmith and Fulham council was one of several local authorities that got into financial difficulties after becoming involved in complex bets on interest rates.

Cable said he could understand why councils were considering such strategies. “When they are massively constrained in what they can do around council tax – and indeed commercial rates – they are trying to prevent even deeper and more damaging cuts by taking these unorthodox measures. In some cases they may succeed, but there is a very high risk of bankrupting their local authorities. It does suggest a certain degree of desperation.”

Local government sources have defended the councils, saying that much of the money is invested in helping regenerate their local areas. But not in all cases. “What is so bizarre, so shocking, is that they are investing in property in other parts of the country,” Cable said. “It makes no sense whatsoever.”

Matthew Oakeshott, an investment manager at Olim Property, said councils were “playing a gigantic game of Monopoly with taxpayers’ cash”.

But authorities badly need returns at a time when interest rates remain low and demands on councils are rising. It is estimated that, by 2020, England’s councils will face a near £6bn funding gap between what they need to spend and what they receive. Most of this shortfall is due to rising costs linked to social care.

Two years ago, the Local Government Association warned that a dozen councils were on the brink of financial failure. Since then, the councils have had to be inventive in seeking to balance their books. Several – such as Eastleigh, Kettering and Maidstone – have successfully exploited loans from the PWLB to invest in commercial property. This, in turn, has attracted interest from other councils.

But such copycat behaviour is a concern, according to Cable, who drew comparisons with 2008, when many councils were left exposed after depositing millions of pounds in high-interest rate accounts offered by Icelandic banks, which then went bust.

“It did very serious damage to some councils,” Cable said. “It should have been a warning to all corporate treasurers in local government to not go anywhere near this.”

The extent to which councils are exposed to a downturn in the commercial property sector is unclear.

Last month, Lord Myners tabled a parliamentary question asking the government to confirm how much money the PWLB had lent to local authorities to invest in commercial real estate between 2011 and 2016, and what it was doing to monitor the risk from such investments.

Responding for the government, Baroness Neville-Rolfe said it was up to the councils to assess risk. She said: “The Public Works Loan Board is not required to collect information on the specific reasons that local authorities borrow from it, and so it does not hold information about the amount of lending that has been used for acquisition of commercial real estate.”

However, estate agent Savills told the Financial Times that councils had invested £1.2bn in commercial property last year and a further £221m so far this year.

An economic downturn could see commercial property yields drop, leaving councils exposed, say analysts. This fear has led some councils to resist investing, but others have developed considerable appetites. The Financial Times reported that Spelthorne borough council – which has assets of just £88m – bought a business park in Sunbury-on-Thames for £360m, having taken out 50 separate loans from the PWLB.

Local government sources played down fears of a bubble, pointing out that every council investment was made on a case-by-case basis and had to meet strict borrowing criteria.

Under the Prudential Code, councils must show that their investment plans are affordable, prudent and sustainable.

A Cuban military plane crashed into a hillside on Saturday morning in the western province of Artemisa, killing eight troops on board, the government said.

In a written statement, the ministry of the revolutionary armed forces said the Soviet-made, twin-engined turboprop Antonov AN-26 took off from the Playa Baracoa airport outside Havana at 6.38am and crashed into a hillside outside the town of Candelaria about 40 miles away.

“The eight military personnel on board, including the crew, died,” the statement published by state-run media said. “A commission … is investigating the causes of the accident.”

Officials did not immediately release any further information.

The majority of planes flown in Cuba were produced in the Soviet Union. Antonov produced the AN-26 planes in Kiev between 1969 and 1986.

The last major plane crash in Cuba was an Aero Caribbean flight that went down in flames in 2010, killing all 68 people aboard. That plane was a European-manufactured ATR-72-212.",guardian.com,False

The US Environmental Protection Agency’s main climate change website is “undergoing changes” to better reflect “the agency’s new direction” under Donald Trump.

The American people – not Big Oil – must decide our climate future | Senator Bernie Sanders and Mark Jacobson Read more

The announcement, made late Friday evening, left empty what was previously the “official government site” providing “comprehensive information on the issue of climate change and global warming”.

The change came a day before thousands gathered in Washington DC and other US cities to protest inaction on climate change, and hours before the symbolic 100-day mark of the Trump administration.

At the marquee climate protest, the Peoples Climate March in Washington, tens of thousands made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue in sweltering heat on their way to encircle the White House.

Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco. In Chicago, marchers headed from the city’s federal plaza to Trump Tower. In Denver, marchers were met with a dose of spring snow.

Some of the marches drew celebrity attendees, including former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the capital and senator and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders at an event in Montpelier, Vermont.

“Honored to join Indigenous leaders and native peoples as they fight for climate justice,” DiCaprio tweeted.

Any marchers who used their phones to look at the EPA climate change website would have been greeted with a message from the new administration: “This page is being updated.”

“As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,” said JP Freire, an associate administrator for public affairs.

Previously, the website housed data on greenhouse gas emissions from large polluters and reports on the effects of climate change and its impact on human health.

“We want to eliminate confusion,” Freire said, “by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we’re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law.”

Information from previous administrations is archived as a link from the EPA’s website.

The Trump administration has called for budget cuts of nearly one-third at the EPA and has sought to weaken protections for human health. For instance, the White House has proposed cutting funding and regulations regarding lead poisoning prevention and is considering rewriting regulations concerning smog.

It has already rolled back a law that prevented coal mining companies from dumping waste in streams.

In an op-ed piece for the Guardian published on Saturday, Sanders made an economic case for a focus on industries meant to ameliorate the effects of climate change, rather than those which contribute to it.

The senator from Vermont wrote: “No matter what agenda President Trump and his administration of climate deniers push, it is clear that jobs in clean energy like wind and solar are growing much more rapidly than jobs in the coal, oil and gas sectors.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/france-election-neofascism-le-pen-macron,"At the university of Paris Nanterre, on the outskirts of the French capital, Antoine Guerreiro of the union of communist students was handing out leaflets urging students to vote for Emmanuel Macron in the final round of the presidential election next Sunday.

Or, to be strictly accurate, to vote against the Front National’s Marine Le Pen. Guerreiro can find very little – if anything – to support in Macron’s programme, but needs must. The alternative is worse.

“On Sunday night, we were all shaken, but now we must carry on without denying our ideals; and one of our strongest ideals is to oppose the far right in all circumstances,” Geurreiro, 19, said. “It’s clear.”

The students are opposing the “ni-ni” (neither-nor) option of abstaining, voting blank or spoiling the ballot paper. Others call it the “ni patrie, ni patron” choice, a rejection of Le Pen’s nationalism and Macron’s support of bankers and bosses.

The leaflet in Guerreiro’s hand said: “After a campaign marked by scandal, neoliberalism and the extreme right … it would be tempting not to turn out for the second round. However, it would not be sensible to let the extreme right run our country.”

The former Socialist mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, told RTL radio he would follow his party’s call to vote for Macron, reminding listeners: “Hitler was elected by universal suffrage. I don’t want to make anyone feel guilty. I’m calling for responsibility, conscience … and generosity. At this given moment we have to put France before our old resentments.”

The conservative Les Républicains party, whose presidential candidate François Fillon was defeated in the first round, has also called for an electoral “barrage” against Le Pen, though some in its traditional Catholic right wing have drifted to the far right.

Even Macron’s arch-nemesis, sheep farmer José Bové, the European ecologist MP and anti-globalisation militant famous for once dismantling a McDonalds restaurant, said he would vote for the En Marche! candidate “without ambiguity or hesitation”. Bové said he had no time for “leftwing purists” like the hard-left firebrand, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. But where was Mélenchon, charismatic leader of La France Insoumise (the France Unbowed) movement? And what would he advise his seven million voters to do?

To refuse to choose between a banker and a fascist is an affront to democracy and history Read more

As the clamour for Mélenchon to speak last week grew, his team said that he was not “a guru” and would not be telling anyone how to vote, while insisting that a vote for Marine Le Pen was “not an option”.

With the question of whether to vote and how causing anguish and anger in equal measure among the hardline French left, for whom Macron is unpalatable and Le Pen beyond the political pale. Jean-Yves Camus, a political analyst with the left-leaning Jean Jaurès foundation and expert on the far right, said waverers needed to be clear in their minds what is at stake.

“This is a choice of civilisation. It’s not a choice between two different programmes or two different political figures. Let’s be completely honest, this is the choice between two kinds of France. That is what’s at stake,” Camus said.

Comparisons with 2002, when the FN founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, knocked out the Socialist party candidate, Lionel Jospin, in the first round of the presidential election, are misleading. The 2002 result was a shock to France and Le Pen himself; he had no credible programme and no real ambition to be president. And in the second round, France voted massively for the conservative Jacques Chirac.

Today no one doubts Marine Le Pen’s will to win. Camus warned that, despite the younger Le Pen’s attempts to clean up the FN’s racist, Holocaust-denying image, the difference between her and her father in political terms was purely cosmetic. “If you listen closely, the words are different, but the policies are the same. Jean-Marie Le Pen said ‘France for the French’, Marine Le Pen says ‘France first’ and her supporters chant: ‘This is our home’,” Camus told a meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association. “We have no choice; we have to stop Le Pen. The spectre of neofascism is still there.”

And he added: “We will probably hear many nasty things in the coming week; nasty stuff about Macron being a former Rothschild banker, for example.”

Harry Bernas, a retired physicist and Mélenchon supporter, said he would be voting Macron because “the danger of abstaining is too great. There is something temporarily irreversible about having Le Pen come to power.

“Thanks to Jean-Luc Mélenchon people have begun thinking there’s another way out of this crisis of poverty, unemployment, despair. The real question is how to vote to keep that going. In my mind it will be easier to continue the fight under Macron than Le Pen, who is more dangerous,” said Bernas.

Joseline Frommer, 68, a former legal assistant and one-time Socialist supporter who also voted for Mélenchon in the first round, admitted she was in the “ni-ni” camp and will vote blank unless the final opinion polls on Friday show that Le Pen could win.

“It’s impossible for me to vote for Le Pen, but a vote for Macron? If I do and he has a huge majority, I think it will make me physically sick. But it’s true, we cannot take the risk of Le Pen winning,” she said.

In Le Monde, Gérard Miller, a psychoanalyst and writer, said Mélenchon supporters like himself were not going to take “moral lessons in anti-fascism”.

“That Macron is today a temporary, very temporary alas, rampart against the Front National, I can admit because I’m going to vote for the leader of En Marche!, but only if we’re going to be lucid: in terms of fighting the far right, nothing, starting with his programme and his past, goes in favour of the former economy minister,” Miller wrote.

Latest polling suggests only 40% of Mélenchon voters will vote for Macron, 45% will abstain, while 15% will vote for Le Pen. On Friday, Mélenchon broke his self-imposed silence to announce he would be voting, but how was between him and the ballot box. This week his campaign team will present the result of a consultation of 450,000 supporters, “Les Insoumis” (the Unbowed), on three choices: to abstain, vote blank or vote for Macron. Mélenchon’s spokesman, Alexis Corbière, said none of the three options for the second round run-off was “immoral”.

Before then, there could be a repeat of last week clashes between police and “anti-fascist” protesters as demonstrators take to the streets across France for the traditional May Day workers’ marches. On Twitter, the #JeVoteMacron (I’m voting Macron) versus the #SansMoiLe7mai (Without me on 7 May), vote or abstain battle continues.

Whatever happens next Sunday, Harry Bernas says the crisis in France is “so bad, so deep and the need for change so great” that the country is at boiling point. “It’s what we physicists call first order transition; when you heat water there’s a change you hardly see just before it turns into vapour, that fluctuation, the agitation around the edge, we’re at that stage, and I think there’s very little chance it will be a subtle, kind or friendly transition.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/29/nhs-nurses-pay-cut-12-per-cent-over-decade,"NHS workers will have had their pay cut by 12% by the end of the decade because of a government-imposed wage restraint that is now exacerbating chronic understaffing, new research reveals.

The 625,000 health service staff who earn at least £22,000 will have seen their income fall by 12% between 2010-11 and 2020-21 as a result of years of below-inflation 0% and 1% pay rises eroding their spending power, according to a report by the Health Foundation thinktank

The real-terms drop in pay will hit NHS personnel across the UK who are on band five or above in the service’s pay scales, which includes all 315,000 nurses. The Royal College of Nursing’s 270,000 members are currently being polled on whether they should strike – for the first time in their history – in protest at the government holding down their pay by limiting rises to 1% every year until 2020.

Staff salaries have already been cut by 6% since the coalition came to power in 2010, more than the 2% seen across the economy as a whole in that time, the report found. Midwives have seen their pay shrink by 6%, but doctors and health visitors have been hit by 8% and 12% drops respectively.

The Health Foundation also found that England could face a shortfall of 42,000 nurses by 2020, and almost half of all nurses believe that current staffing levels are already dangerously stretched.

Staff pay has fallen back so much that it is now causing major problems, the thinktank said. “The current phase of national NHS pay bill control began at a time of economic recession, with low inflation and high unemployment. However, this is increasingly being replaced by greater numbers of staff shortages and the likelihood of higher inflation.” It adds: “Having contained NHS staff earnings growth in recent years, UK governments now face a situation where recent trends and future projections highlight that earnings in the broader economy are growing more rapidly, and inflation is at a level that will erode the purchasing power of NHS staff.”

A Cuban military plane crashed into a hillside on Saturday morning in the western province of Artemisa, killing eight troops on board, the government said.

In a written statement, the ministry of the revolutionary armed forces said the Soviet-made, twin-engined turboprop Antonov AN-26 took off from the Playa Baracoa airport outside Havana at 6.38am and crashed into a hillside outside the town of Candelaria about 40 miles away.

“The eight military personnel on board, including the crew, died,” the statement published by state-run media said. “A commission … is investigating the causes of the accident.”

Officials did not immediately release any further information.

The majority of planes flown in Cuba were produced in the Soviet Union. Antonov produced the AN-26 planes in Kiev between 1969 and 1986.

The last major plane crash in Cuba was an Aero Caribbean flight that went down in flames in 2010, killing all 68 people aboard. That plane was a European-manufactured ATR-72-212.",guardian.com,False

The US Environmental Protection Agency’s main climate change website is “undergoing changes” to better reflect “the agency’s new direction” under Donald Trump.

The American people – not Big Oil – must decide our climate future | Senator Bernie Sanders and Mark Jacobson Read more

The announcement, made late Friday evening, left empty what was previously the “official government site” providing “comprehensive information on the issue of climate change and global warming”.

The change came a day before thousands gathered in Washington DC and other US cities to protest inaction on climate change, and hours before the symbolic 100-day mark of the Trump administration.

At the marquee climate protest, the Peoples Climate March in Washington, tens of thousands made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue in sweltering heat on their way to encircle the White House.

Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco. In Chicago, marchers headed from the city’s federal plaza to Trump Tower. In Denver, marchers were met with a dose of spring snow.

Some of the marches drew celebrity attendees, including former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the capital and senator and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders at an event in Montpelier, Vermont.

“Honored to join Indigenous leaders and native peoples as they fight for climate justice,” DiCaprio tweeted.

Any marchers who used their phones to look at the EPA climate change website would have been greeted with a message from the new administration: “This page is being updated.”

“As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,” said JP Freire, an associate administrator for public affairs.

Previously, the website housed data on greenhouse gas emissions from large polluters and reports on the effects of climate change and its impact on human health.

“We want to eliminate confusion,” Freire said, “by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we’re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law.”

Information from previous administrations is archived as a link from the EPA’s website.

The Trump administration has called for budget cuts of nearly one-third at the EPA and has sought to weaken protections for human health. For instance, the White House has proposed cutting funding and regulations regarding lead poisoning prevention and is considering rewriting regulations concerning smog.

It has already rolled back a law that prevented coal mining companies from dumping waste in streams.

In an op-ed piece for the Guardian published on Saturday, Sanders made an economic case for a focus on industries meant to ameliorate the effects of climate change, rather than those which contribute to it.

The senator from Vermont wrote: “No matter what agenda President Trump and his administration of climate deniers push, it is clear that jobs in clean energy like wind and solar are growing much more rapidly than jobs in the coal, oil and gas sectors.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/acid-attacks-italy-gessica-notaro,"Gessica Notaro has become the face of a campaign to end violence against women

On the sixth anniversary of her brother’s suicide, Gessica Notaro, a dolphin trainer and former Miss Italy finalist, thought that she would die too.

As she returned home from dinner with friends on 10 January, the 28-year-old had acid thrown in her face, allegedly by her ex-boyfriend Jorge Edson Tavares, 29.

The attack left her badly disfigured and almost blind in one eye, and Notaro claims her attacker picked the date on purpose. “He was well aware that it was the anniversary of my brother’s death,” she told the Observer at her home in Rimini, on Italy’s Adriatic coast.

Tavares, with whom she lived for three years, is in custody but denies any involvement. Notaro appeared in court for the trial of her ex-boyfriend on charges of stalking last week.

She revealed her horrific injuries for the first time when she appeared on Italy’s Maurizio Constanzo chatshow, and told viewers: “I want you to see what he did to me. This isn’t love.”

The case has captured the public’s attention in a country where attacks involving cheap and easily obtainable corrosive liquids are on the rise. There were 27 registered assaults in 2016, compared with eight in 2013, according to data provided by police to SOS Stalking, an organisation set up to support the victims of harassment.

This figure may pale in comparison with England, where in London alone there were 454 such attacks last year. But within the context of Italy’s high rate of femicide – 116 women were killed by their partners or ex-partners between January and November last year, according to figures from the national statistics agency – the phenomenon is worrying.

“England is quite different from Italy in that many of the cases there are between gangs of men,” said Lorenzo Puglisi, a lawyer and founder of SOS Stalking. “But here some 90% of acid attacks are against women by former boyfriends who can’t accept that the relationship is over. Acid is their most destructive tool, a way of saying ‘If I can’t have you, then nobody else can either’. It’s partly a cultural problem because many people still see women as objects to be owned by men.”

Notaro, who was crowned beauty queen of the Emilia-Romagna region in 2007 before going on to reach the finals of the Miss Italy beauty contest, fell in love with Tavares when mutual friends brought him to a gathering at her home in 2013.

Tavares, whom she described as being the perfect gentleman, asked her mother’s permission before he moved in with her a week later. “He had a strong, stubborn character, and we argued like any normal couple, but he was never aggressive towards me while we were together,” she said.

Notaro, who found Tavares a job alongside her at Rimini’s dolphinarium, said the trouble began last August, when she turned down his marriage proposal and ended the relationship.

He then allegedly began a campaign of harassment, bombarding her with phone calls, text messages and following her every movement during a six-month period, which brought on severe panic attacks. She claims he staged a fake suicide outside her home in order to get her sympathy.

“I had anxiety before due to losing both my brother and my father, but during this period I was living a nightmare,” she said.

Notaro reported the harassment to police and Tavares was eventually given a restraining order after he allegedly threatened to destroy her life. Fearing acid might be his weapon of choice, she kept a helmet in her car to wear on the short walk between the car park and her home whenever she returned after dark. On the night of the attack, she didn’t have it with her.

Domestic violence and guns: the hidden American crisis ending women's lives Read more

Tavares allegedly pounced, pouring an entire bottle over her, as she opened the car door to get her bag.

“My first thought was, ‘My God, he actually did it’. I expected it but still couldn’t believe it had happened.”

As her face started burning and the reality of the horrifying ordeal set in, the thing she feared most was losing her sight. “I started to pray – if I survive, take away my beauty, but please not my eyes. What would I do without my eyes?”

Notaro, who has also worked as a TV presenter, singer and dancer, spent two months in hospital and underwent several operations, including one to save the sight in her left eye.

She has to wait a year before she can begin reconstructive surgery. Meanwhile, she takes a cocktail of medication almost every hour, including eye drops and creams to ease the pain. She has difficulty sleeping, as she is unable to close her eyes, and struggles with eating and speaking.

The high-profile case is similar to that of Lucia Annibali, a lawyer whose face was left badly corroded after her former boyfriend, Luca Varani, hired two men to douse her with sulphuric acid as she returned home one night in 2013. Varani, also a lawyer, was sentenced to 20 years in prison a year later.

Tavares faces up to 12 years if charged and found guilty of causing serious injuries, said Puglisi. That would be on top of a conviction for stalking.

Italy introduced laws in 2013 to crack down on violence against women after being shamed by a UN report, which said domestic violence was the country’s “most pervasive form of violence”.

“In recent years police have increased their knowledge about acid attacks, so we now have agents who are equipped to deal with cases,” said Puglisi.

“The problem is we don’t have the budget to prevent this kind of crime. In Britain, GPS is used to track stalkers. In Italy, we’re testing GPS but it’s not being used as it should be because we don’t have the money. This is a very big issue, because using this kind of thing could cut this type of crime by half – in the case of Notaro, this could have been the solution had the man in jail been tracked.”

Annibali, whose face was reconstructed after almost 20 operations, has become the symbol in the campaign to stop violence against women, a role Notaro, who was visited by Italy’s justice minister, Andrea Orlando, last week, is starting to take on herself.

Since the attack, she has been inundated with messages from other victims of stalking and abuse seeking support. “Even after everything, I still have my strong character,” she said.

“And now I feel useful in helping other people. I will continue to campaign, which I know in itself will be a challenge – but after having acid thrown in my face, very few things frighten me now.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/29/handsome-devil-tackles-homophobia-with-a-laugh,"A while back, the director John Butler decided he wanted to make a mainstream buddy movie with a difference. It was to feature two teenage boys, whose sexuality would never explicitly be revealed, and the backdrop would be a fee-paying rugby-obsessed Irish school with a culture of unthinking homophobia. It would have a dash of Dead Poets Society, a nod to the feelgood John Hughes films of the 1980s, and it would culminate in a classic tale of sporting triumph on the rugby pitch. And Butler wanted to do all this on a shoestring budget and a 25-day shoot.

Amazingly, the 44-year-old director managed it. Handsome Devil, which stars young Irish actors Fionn O’Shea and Nicholas Galitzine as the adolescent schoolboys, and Sherlock star Andrew Scott as their inspirational teacher, has just been released to a wave of acclaim. Critics have called it “charming”, “terrific” and swiftly styled it “the Irish Moonlight”.

Power Rangers features first gay screen superhero Read more

“I will take that,” Butler says when we meet in a hotel in central London. “I loved Moonlight … I wept like an infant for the last hour of that film.”

But Moonlight, however brilliant, was still a film “lobbed from the margins into the mainstream”, says Butler. Handsome Devil, by contrast, tries to make a different point: “That LGBT issues are mainstream and they should be funded by the mainstream. We should be seeing $50m LGBT comedies with realistic couples at the middle of it. Because it’s one in 10 of us, you know? We belong in the mainstream.”

Scott nods in agreement. The 40-year-old actor, best known for playing Moriarty in the BBC drama series Sherlock, came out as gay in 2013. He is currently appearing as Hamlet in a new sellout production at the Almeida Theatre in London.

“My own experience has been that, since being open, I’ve had more opportunity,” Scott says. “That’s not because I’m gay or straight. It’s because, personally, I feel I have a degree of authenticity about who I am.”

It’s certainly true that Scott is an actor of great range and talent: one minute starring as a gay rights activist in Pride, the next taking on the part of an MI6 spook in the Bond film Spectre, or playing barrister Anthony Julius in the David Hare-scripted Denial.

“I really do think the sexuality of characters is the most boring part to play,” he says. “Your homo- or heterosexuality is neither a virtue nor a flaw. It just isn’t. Who you want to have sex with is not something you cultivate.”

Would he like to see an openly gay cultural figure such as James Bond or Doctor Who? “Visibility and diversity is massively important but there’s no point in writing a terrible gay- or female-led drama if it’s not authentic,” he says. “I mean, would I like to see that? Of course I would, but not at the cost of a really interesting idea.”

He has little time for the media trying to lump together the experience of “gay” actors: “You don’t compare Sylvester Stallone and someone who is in the Twilight movie because they’re straight,” he says.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nicholas Galitzine and Fionn O’Shea in Handsome Devil.

The first time Scott and Butler worked together was in Butler’s 2013 debut film, The Stag, which focused on that most arcane heterosexual activity: the stag weekend. Scott played the (straight) best man charged with organising a male-bonding hiking excursion.

In a case of life imitating art, Scott and Butler also bonded over having grown up in the same Dublin suburb of Goatstown. “We used to have these one-and-a-half-hour-long conversations about the intricacies of Goatstown,” Scott says. “The Esso garage …”

“The Big ‘n Tall menswear shop,” Butler interjects.

“The bus timetable,” Scott continues. “He and I had a similar recall for Proustian details.”

“Exactly,” Butler says, laughing now. “The Goatstown 62 bus timetable is our madeleine.”

When the part of an English teacher came up in Handsome Devil, Scott leapt at the chance to work with the director again. Both he and Butler, who also wrote the script, felt it was important to tackle the issue of homophobic bullying in schools.

Scott regularly receives “deeply affecting” letters from teenagers struggling with their identity and he wants to be able to tell them that “coming out is nothing to do with sex. Coming out is to do with saying ‘this is who I am’.” By doing it, he says, “your burden has become your gift”.

Butler, who attended a private school in Ireland not unlike the one depicted in Handsome Devil, was lucky enough never to have been the target of bullying, but he developed an ear for inherited homophobic language: the boys in the film unthinkingly make an overly camp “Oooohhhh” sound to denote supposed “gayness” without quite knowing what they’re doing.

“It’s from the Carry On films in the 1960s,” says Butler. “You suddenly realise you’re taking on some bullshit language your grandfather would have used.”

He was keen that the movie had the lowest possible certification “so that an eight-year-old could see it. This issue is so important. I never had personal experience of bullying at school but I’ve always felt the best way to dismiss bullying is to treat it with levity: it’s to find bullying funny in its patheticness.”

Although it tackles serious themes, Handsome Devil is shot through with a warm-hearted charm that makes it deeply entertaining to watch, in large part because of the winning performance from O’Shea, the young Irish actor who took on the role of Ned, a sensitive musician who teaches his rugby-playing roommate that it takes strength to be gentle and kind. O’Shea was 19 when they filmed, and Butler says he was constantly amazed by O’Shea’s maturity and the “emotional intelligence” of all the teenage actors.

Did Scott feel the same? “No,” he replies deadpan. “I thought they were little pricks.”

He’s joking. Scott recently did a week of Hamlet performances for young audiences who were all under 25, and “the atmosphere was amazing. The energy! The quality of the laughter! The enthusiasm! They were the five best performances we’ve done in the whole run.”

There is, he says, “a lot of bullshit spoken about young people: that they’re apathetic or whatever and that’s not how it is. They’re incredibly passionate.”

Scott is often asked whether young Sherlock fans come to the theatre just to take photos of him on their phones: “You know, I’m asked, are they going to act like savages? Because if they’re fans of Sherlock or something like James Bond, [there is this assumption] they’re not possessed of the qualities necessary to spend hours in the theatre without Snapchatting.

“In my experience, if a phone’s ringing, it’s someone in late middle age who doesn’t know how to turn it off and they think ‘who’ll be ringing me anyway?’ and they let it ring out … Young people know how to turn their phone off.”

It is an important time to be releasing a film whose essential message is the need to live an authentic life. In America, Donald Trump was elected on campaign rhetoric soaked with casual misogyny and discriminatory comments. Earlier this year, his administration rescinded guidance to school districts on how to provide a safe and inclusive environment for transgender students.

Butler nods vociferously when I bring this up: “This film was written at a time when building a wall between America and Mexico seemed insane. We look back at that now as a zenith of liberal acceptance in the world!”

“I think the arts need to respond ferociously,” Scott says.”The only way is to make stuff that’s truthful and make sure it’s seen by everybody.”

Starting with Handsome Devil? “Yes,” Butler grins. “That would be great.”",guardian.com,False

Market research firm Mintel reports a 12% rise in women doing some sort of needlecraft as a hobby in the last two years. A fifth of women under 45 are interested in taking up knitting and sewing, while 17% of men aged 16 to 24 are keen to try one of these pastimes. Julie Hassan, senior buyer at London store Liberty, says there has been double-digit growth in the fabric and haberdashery departments this season and the store is increasing its range by 25%. “To inspire shoppers, we’ll be showcasing the work of renowned crafters and textile artists alongside materials to make things with themselves,” she says.

Blue Gem, the private equity firm that owns Liberty, has sewn up a £68m investment in a trio of businesses, and is looking for new acquisitions in the sector, having seen a burgeoning appetite for needlecrafts among the younger generation of design-conscious consumers.

In August, it acquired Wool & The Gang, the London-based purveyor of trend-led patterns, yarns and kits created in collaboration with catwalk designers including Giles Deacon and Vivienne Westwood. Sirdar, the hand-knitting yarn business that has been spinning wool in Yorkshire since the late 19th century, has now been added to the portfolio alongside DMC, which has produced premium embroidery threads in France since 1746.

Mr X Stitch, who has a new book coming out, The Mr X Stitch Guide to Cross Stitch, recently designed a collection of kits for DMC using glow-in-the-dark thread to create his “Dark-itecture” collection of urban skylines that change appearance in different lights.

“The growing trend of craft DIY to monogram and customise clothing and accessories has led to a resurgence of embroidery and needlework,” says Massimo Saracchi, executive chairman of the new DMC Group. “These are global trends happening right across the world: it is a huge and growing market. People are intoxicated by their phones and computers these days and want to take a break and do something with their hands. These are activities which tap seamlessly into the normalised behaviour for people to share their creations on social media.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A busy class at the London Craft Club.

According to Google Trends, searches for knitting have increased in the UK by 53% over the past year, while the emergence of platforms such as Pinterest, Instagram and YouTube has created vast virtual communities of crafters sharing tutorials, ideas and inspiration.

A decade ago the demise of craft skills was widely predicted, but now there has been an explosion of boutique fabric and haberdashery retailers on the high street and online to cater for this new generation of stylish, contemporary makers. Names such as Merchant & Mills, Purl Soho and Loop are hallowed by modern stitchers, while “sweary cross-stitch”, “feminist embroidery” and “subversive stitching” are all popular search terms online for those who want more than traditional designs.

Rachel Hart founded the Ray Stitch webshop in 2009 and opened a small shop in Islington, north London, two years later.

“We are definitely reaching a younger, more design-conscious customer, and a generation of teens through to thirtysomethings who were never really taught to sew,” she says.

Hart expanded into larger premises earlier this month, where she hosts sellout classes in the modern basement studio. “We run three or four beginners classes a week and they are always full. We get lots of high-powered people with stressful jobs in the City, who want to do something to release the professional pressure with something calm and creative.”

In a bid to move away from corporate life and regain her own work-life balance, Sonia Bownes launched the London Craft Club three years ago and runs a series of classes around London and the south-east, teaching patchwork, arm knitting (using your arms instead of needles to create giant stitches), beginners sewing, quilting and more. “Craft has really taken off in a big way,” says Bownes, whose roster of workshops is growing exponentially and will see a corporate arm added this year to host wellbeing craft classes in the workplace.

While our grandmothers may have sewn out of necessity, and had skills passed down through the generations, the industrial revolution of the 20th century has meant making is no longer the life skill it once was. The new wave of stitchers are benefiting from a form of crafty mindfulness in an increasingly pressurised, yet passive world, where, according to media regulator Ofcom, British adults spend an average of nine hours a day online.

“At times of economic stress and social upheaval, we often turn to craft, as creating something with our hands makes us feel good,” says Polly Leonard, founder of Selvedge magazine, which is hosting the Selvedge Wellbeing Spa next week as part of London craft week.

“Making is part of being human, yet as a society we are suffering from the effect of increased screen time and the lack of real fulfilment that often accompanies that. Most needlecrafts are fairly accessible and require only basic skills and minimal outlay to achieve very rewarding results.

“The rhythmic, repetitive moments necessary to knit, sew or crochet are proven to have therapeutic benefits and improve mental health and emotional wellbeing, increasing serotonin production and inducing a natural state of mindfuness.”",guardian.com,False

Sirdar, the hand-knitting yarn business that has been spinning wool in Yorkshire since the late 19th century, has now been added to the portfolio alongside DMC, which has produced premium embroidery threads in France since 1746.

Mr X Stitch, who has a new book coming out, The Mr X Stitch Guide to Cross Stitch, recently designed a collection of kits for DMC using glow-in-the-dark thread to create his “Dark-itecture” collection of urban skylines that change appearance in different lights.

“The growing trend of craft DIY to monogram and customise clothing and accessories has led to a resurgence of embroidery and needlework,” says Massimo Saracchi, executive chairman of the new DMC Group. “These are global trends happening right across the world: it is a huge and growing market. People are intoxicated by their phones and computers these days and want to take a break and do something with their hands. These are activities which tap seamlessly into the normalised behaviour for people to share their creations on social media.”

According to Google Trends, searches for knitting have increased in the UK by 53% over the past year, while the emergence of platforms such as Pinterest, Instagram and YouTube has created vast virtual communities of crafters sharing tutorials, ideas and inspiration.

A decade ago the demise of craft skills was widely predicted, but now there has been an explosion of boutique fabric and haberdashery retailers on the high street and online to cater for this new generation of stylish, contemporary makers. Names such as Merchant & Mills, Purl Soho and Loop are hallowed by modern stitchers, while “sweary cross-stitch”, “feminist embroidery” and “subversive stitching” are all popular search terms online for those who want more than traditional designs.

Rachel Hart founded the Ray Stitch webshop in 2009 and opened a small shop in Islington, north London, two years later.

“We are definitely reaching a younger, more design-conscious customer, and a generation of teens through to thirtysomethings who were never really taught to sew,” she says.

Hart expanded into larger premises earlier this month, where she hosts sellout classes in the modern basement studio. “We run three or four beginners classes a week and they are always full. We get lots of high-powered people with stressful jobs in the City, who want to do something to release the professional pressure with something calm and creative.”

In a bid to move away from corporate life and regain her own work-life balance, Sonia Bownes launched the London Craft Club three years ago and runs a series of classes around London and the south-east, teaching patchwork, arm knitting (using your arms instead of needles to create giant stitches), beginners sewing, quilting and more. “Craft has really taken off in a big way,” says Bownes, whose roster of workshops is growing exponentially and will see a corporate arm added this year to host wellbeing craft classes in the workplace.

While our grandmothers may have sewn out of necessity, and had skills passed down through the generations, the industrial revolution of the 20th century has meant making is no longer the life skill it once was. The new wave of stitchers are benefiting from a form of crafty mindfulness in an increasingly pressurised, yet passive world, where, according to media regulator Ofcom, British adults spend an average of nine hours a day online.

“At times of economic stress and social upheaval, we often turn to craft, as creating something with our hands makes us feel good,” says Polly Leonard, founder of Selvedge magazine, which is hosting the Selvedge Wellbeing Spa next week as part of London craft week.

“Making is part of being human, yet as a society we are suffering from the effect of increased screen time and the lack of real fulfilment that often accompanies that. Most needlecrafts are fairly accessible and require only basic skills and minimal outlay to achieve very rewarding results.

“The rhythmic, repetitive moments necessary to knit, sew or crochet are proven to have therapeutic benefits and improve mental health and emotional wellbeing, increasing serotonin production and inducing a natural state of mindfuness.”",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/29/intimacy-sex-better-relationships,"The key to a great relationship is more than physical – it’s about taking off the mask and really revealing yourself

Is there anything we still need to know about sex? Apparently, yes: and the missing ingredient is a gamechanger not just for individuals, but entire nations.

Sex has been centre-stage in western culture for decades, but what has been absent, according to Adam Wilder, creator of the world’s first Festival of Togetherness, is the magic element that makes it all meaningful.

“The holy grail,” he says, “is intimacy. Intimacy’s the real taboo in our society – it’s the thing we fear, because it’s about taking off the mask that so many of us hide behind. But it’s the key to being freer, happier and more alive and it could change not only our personal lives, but the political decisions we take as a society.”

Wilder hopes his festival, in central London on 20-21 May, will herald “the next revolution we need to embark on – a revolution that will transform everything we thought we knew about sex”.

Sex and intimacy, says Wilder, are closely connected. But in the decades since the sexual revolution of the 1960s the focus has been more and more on sex and less and less on intimacy. “Of course, you can have sex without intimacy, just as you can have intimacy without sex. But when you put the two together you have an experience that is in a different ballpark when it comes to fulfilment,” he says. “The problem is, people are afraid of intimacy, they’re afraid to articulate the desires that could lead to real intimacy – but if we don’t articulate those desires we will never experience the potential of a relationship.”

So scary is the word intimacy, says Wilder, that he has shied away from using it while planning his festival. “When I talk to people about it, I talk mostly about human connection, about enriching relationships and about togetherness, because these are words people seem more comfortable with.”

The festival focuses on learning the skills the organisers say are essential to allowing ourselves to practise intimacy. “But this isn’t hippy stuff: what I’m interested in is ordinary people who don’t like words like ‘consciousness’ and ‘tantra’,” says Wilder. “I want to make intimacy more visible in our culture, and that means drawing everyone in. Intimacy is something everyone can gain from, whether they are in a relationship or not.”

The movie Lost in Translation, starring Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, has much to share about intimacy, says Wilder. The plot centres on a growing closeness between an ageing movie star and a young college graduate that far outweighs the connection she feels for her husband, a photographer who is away on an assignment.

The festival’s highlights include a “cuddle workshop” that, according to the programme, promises to “explore touch outside the sexual realm”, a session on “mindfulness for better sex” and a session on language and communication skills that help build intimacy into relationships. One of the most exciting workshops, Wilder hopes, is called the Soulmate Delusion.

“There is this idea in Disney films that so many of us buy into, that’s about connecting with one person who is right for you, and who will change your life. But the truth is, that’s a view that is a really damaging for relationships in the 21st century. As soon as things start to go wrong you think, uh-oh, he’s not my soulmate.”

Wilder’s event seems to be tapping into a broader zeitgeist. Last week saw the launch of the Amorist, writer Rowan Pelling’s new magazine, which aims “to counter the modern tendency to see sex through a purely functional prism”.

Pelling agrees with Wilder that intimacy, not sex, is fundamental. “Is sex better with intimacy? The answer is almost always yes. I’m really shocked by how many people say they’ve never been to bed with someone who looked them in the eye, particularly at the point of orgasm. Of course there’s something about people being in their box and having fantasies during sex, but if people are having a lifetime of sex without eye contact, it’s an indication of how common it is to be physically close to someone, yet remain disconnected.

“There’s something peculiarly British about it. What it means is you can have had many lovers, yet not ever had something as fundamental as intimate sex.”

Wilder says feelings of isolation and a lack of true human connection have fed into the seismic political shifts that produced Brexit and elected Donald Trump as US president. That is the view, too, of philosopher Shahidha Bari of the Institute of Art and Ideas, who is one of the people behind an event called Love in the Time of Tinder taking place this weekend in Hay-on-Wye.

Amid talks, debates and workshop about the meaning of love, whether it can be chemically engineered and how it can be used to change society, the weekend also encompasses the idea that these things matter in a global, and not just a personal, landscape.

“If we can get love right in our individual lives, we might start to get things better in the political arena,” says Bari. “We think of love these days as an app on our phones, but in fact it’s a model of ethical relationships.

“There’s something miraculous about love, which allows us to care for someone to whom we are not genetically related. Love isn’t some sentimental thing, it’s about recognising this miracle for what it is, and learning from it for the rest of our lives.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/29/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-long-term-benefits-mothers-depression,"Cognitive behavioural therapy has significant positive effects on a mother’s mental health, income, employment and parenting skills even seven years after the birth of the child, according to the first study of its kind.

The international research project into the impact of depression on pregnant mothers and their babies, led by Professor Sonia Bhalotra from the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, could have major implications for public policy.

More than 400 million people worldwide report episodes of depression, at a global cost of around £600bn in 2010. Between 12% and 20% of women in the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suffer from perinatal depression, and 20-35% in poorer countries.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help a person manage problems by changing how they think and behave. The NHS website explains that it is “based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle”.

CBT encourages people to see their problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts.

While studies have highlighted the short-term benefits of CBT, until now question marks have been raised about whether it can have long-term effects.

The study, one of the largest randomised control trials to be held in the developing world, followed women diagnosed with depression mid-pregnancy in 40 communities in rural Pakistan. Within a year, more than half of the women in a control group (58%) were still depressed, whereas only a quarter of the mothers who had been treated with CBT reported depression.

Returning to the women and their children seven years later, researchers found that the treated mothers were still significantly less likely to be depressed than the control group. The first group were also more likely to be employed and have control over household spending. There were also big improvements in their parenting style.

The study found that women who had least social support such as those who were not living with or near their mother or mother-in-law, benefited most from the therapy intervention, both in the short and long term.

“These findings on the longer-term benefits at seven years post-treatment are really exciting,” Bhalotra said. “This is an important study for the impact on mothers with depression but there are global implications for the treatment of all human beings suffering from depression. We have seen that CBT has changed how many of the treated women live their lives now – their mental health has improved, their financial situation and their empowerment over their lives, and undoubtedly the way they interact with their children.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/29/when-good-tv-goes-bad-battlestar-galactica,"Sci-fi in the 1970s was rambunctiously silly. Star Wars gave us space warriors with furry dog-faced alien sidekicks, while Doctor Who centred on a jelly-baby-munching time traveller with a penchant for scarves the length of The Great Wall of China. Less well remembered, but no less nutty, was 1978’s Battlestar Galactica, in which the last remnants of humanity flee through space from the evil Cylons, a race of shiny space-robot villains who all have voices like T-Pain.

The show lasted just two seasons before space-pilots Starbuck and Apollo were pensioned off to a retirement home for Luke Skywalker lookalikes. For decades, hardcore acolytes petitioned for a revival and few expected much when the Ronald D Moore-led reboot finally arrived in 2003. How to update a show whose worst excesses included a furry robot dog played by an actual chimp for a generation coping with the grim reality of George W Bush’s “war on terror”?

The answer, as every futuristic show from Humans to Westworld has since learned, was to go down the sexy robots route. Arnold Schwarzenegger may have been pretty badass in Terminator, but Moore seemed to know instinctively that the new machine apocalypse should be led by 6ft, blond ultra-vixen cyborgs given to cooing sweet nothings into mankind’s ear. Unlike their giant tin-can predecessors, these new Cylons were never quite sure whether they wanted to destroy humanity or take us on a really weird date. And with the enemy now wearing a human face, the show was able to explore fiercely contemporary corners of the post-9/11 landscape. As Mary McDonnell’s President Laura Roslin led the galactic fleet through the cosmos, we were treated to intelligent debate over the pros and cons of democracy, of bloody revenge versus the rule of law, even whether the concept of human rights should be extended to sexy space robots.

This new Battlestar Galactica first began to take a wrong turn as early as the second season, when Jamie Bamber’s Lee Adama (the new Apollo) swapped blasting Cylon spaceships and having fighty sex with Katee Sackhoff’s Kara Thrace (the new, female, Starbuck) for a fat-suit and a desk job. The election of James Callis’s serial Cylon shagger Gaius Baltar to president of the fleet was another “what the frak?” moment, especially combined with the decision to maroon our intrepid space travellers on the tedious planet of New Caprica for what seemed like aeons.

But Galactica really lost the plot during the finale of season three, in which four of the “final five” Cylons were drawn out of their respective hidey holes by a sitar version of All Along the Watchtower, and Starbuck returned from the dead as an angel with a map to Earth. From there on in, the show’s quasi-religious leanings went into overdrive, leading quickly to the preposterous sight of Baltar starting his own cult and performing Jesus-like miracles, while Roslin tumbled ever deeper into narcotic-inspired visions of humanity’s salvation. Moore and his team might have successfully updated Battlestar Galactica for the 21st century, but an audience can only take so many holy revelations before it longs for a return to the simple joys of cool space battles and robot sexy time.",guardian.com,False

David Moyes experienced the worst day of his career in football as Sunderland’s 10-year Premier League tenure ended with a 1-0 defeat at home to Bournemouth and the Stadium of Light echoed to chants demanding his dismissal.

Relegation to the Championship was most definitely not what the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad manager envisaged when he succeeded Sam Allardyce last July and explains why, on the eve of the match, Moyes revealed he was considering his future. Sunderland’s seventh manager in six years is expected to step down this summer but before finalising any decision he will meet Ellis Short, the club’s owner and Martin Bain, the chief executive.

Sunderland relegated from Premier League after defeat by Bournemouth Read more

“I don’t think today’s the right time to talk about my future. That’s a conversation for another day I need to wait and gather my thoughts,” said an unusually subdued and quietly spoken Moyes.

“I’ll sit down with Ellis and Martin in the next week or so and speak about it but I’m more concerned about the people who follow the club. My emotions are with the people in this area, they’re the ones I feel for.”

The Scot – a candidate to succeed Gordon Strachan as his country’s coach this summer – readily agreed that relegation represented a personal nadir before apologising to Sunderland fans. “It’s my worst day in football, definitely the worst day, but my thoughts are with the supporters,” he said. “I’m just sorry we weren’t able to do a better job.

“I don’t think this is the time to offer them a reason why but they come here in their thousands week in week out and travel the country in their thousands as well. I’m so disappointed we couldn’t give them more. I know that cash isn’t always easy to come by in this part of the country, so I appreciate every penny they put into the club by watching the team. I hoped relegation would never come.”

Although shouldering a degree of responsibility, Moyes emphasised that he viewed this season as a collective failure at a club that have flirted with the Championship for the past five seasons and are £110m in debt, up for sale and carry one of the Premier League’s top-10 wage bills. With scores of staff about to be made redundant and nine senior players out of contract next month the future could scarcely be more uncertain. “There’s no criticism of the players, of their effort or commitment, they played as well as they could,” said a manager disappointed by the degree of transfer market backing he received from Short. “But I’m experienced, I know what a Premier League squad looks like and I’ve felt right from the start we’ve been a little short of the quality we need.

“The problem’s been a collective thing from top to bottom here, I don’t think it’s down to any one person. It’s been a long hard season of not winning games and that drags everyone down. You don’t feel good about it but we’ll regroup, take a bit of time and see what to do.”

In a statement, Short apologised and admitted mistakes: “Like any supporter my initial reaction is one of sadness, disappointment, anger and frustration,” he said. “It’s hard for everyone to take. It’s an especially cruel blow for our supporters and I am truly sorry we have not been able to retain our top-flight status for them.

“I acknowledge that during my ownership mistakes have been made, particularly in the area of player recruitment and we are paying the price for that now. We need to improve both on and off the field and there is a strong determination to do so.”

Eddie Howe was sympathetic. “David’s an outstanding manager and he will come back from this,” said Bournemouth’s manager, who saw Josh King score the game’s only goal in the 88th minute. “It’s sad to see a big club like Sunderland go down but the Premier League is unforgiving, it’s such a good standard this year and small margins decide important things.”

With his side stuck to the bottom and 13 points adrift of 17th-placed Hull, Moyes’s problem is that the gap between Sunderland and much of the division has become embarrassingly wide.",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/29/russian-grand-prix-lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel,"Lewis Hamilton admitted that he did not have the pace to match his Ferrari rival Sebastian Vettel after the German and his team brought Mercedes’ dominance in qualifying to an end with a front row lockout for the Russian Grand Prix, their first since the 2008 race in France. The performance demonstrated definitively the resurgence of the Scuderia that has ignited the new Formula One season.

Vettel claimed pole with a perfect lap and was followed by his team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen, in second. Hamilton, who had struggled bringing his tyres into their operating window all weekend and with his car’s setup, qualified in fourth behind his team-mate, Valtteri Bottas. “I just wasn’t quick enough today,” said the British driver. “It was all in the last sector, I’ve been struggling there all weekend with the balance and it’s been tough to utilise the tyres.”

After three years of Mercedes dominance, during which Hamilton has won two of his three world championships, he acknowledged that this year Ferrari are proving to be a more than significant threat. “Ferrari did a great job,” he said. “That was the best job I could do today.”

Hamilton was uncharacteristically short of confidence that he could come back against the Ferraris on Sunday. “Currently we are fourth, it’s very hard to overtake and their race pace was better than mine,” he said. “I was more than half a second off the pace today. But we will do some studying and try and turn negatives into positives. Who knows, we should hopefully be in a better position tomorrow.”

This is the first time Mercedes have not had a car on the front row for 31 races and the first time they have not claimed pole for 18 consecutive meetings. Vettel, who leads the Briton by seven points in the world championship, appreciated the significance of the achievement. “Mercedes have been very, very dominant the last years in qualifying, so it’s good to get there,” he said. “It’s been a mega qualifying.

Mark Selby said it would be a dream come true to become a three-times world champion after he set up a Crucible final showdown with John Higgins.

The emotion of reaching another world championship final was clear as Selby bellowed “Come on!” and struck the table once he crossed the winning line against Ding Junhui.

The 33-year-old from Leicester won the semi-final 17-15, while Higgins needed one frame of the evening session to wrap up a 17-8 win over an out-of-sorts Barry Hawkins, firing a 120 break. Explaining his raucous reaction, Selby said: “It was more a relief than anything else.”

He had capitalised on a golden chance left to him by Ding, who missed the blue when looking like he might level the match and force a deciding frame. Selby’s 72 break nudged him to victory.

“I told myself that even if I took two minutes on every shot, make sure you don’t do something silly,” Selby said. “That was my chance and if I didn’t take it then I think the match would have got away from me and Ding could have come through. I made sure I didn’t rush anything even though the adrenaline was pumping.”

Now the 41-year-old Higgins stands in the way of the world No1 and a third triumph in Sheffield in four years. The four-times champion becomes the oldest finalist since the 49-year-old Ray Reardon lost to Alex Higgins in 1982.

Selby is the modern master of the sport, succeeding Higgins, Ronnie O’Sullivan and the retired Stephen Hendry. But he knows in Higgins he will be tackling a player who, though no longer as consistent as he was once, knows exactly what it takes to triumph in Sheffield.

“I can’t wait. It’s going to be a fantastic occasion,” Selby said. “He’s a great player. One of the greats of the game. It’s going to be another tough match. If he wins another one he’ll be equalling O’Sullivan, trying to create a bit of history himself.”

Selby potted fewer balls and scored fewer points than Ding, but plotted his way to victory all the same. It is hard to imagine a tougher match player than Selby, and such wins demonstrate why he has topped the world rankings for the last two years and is pulling away.

Higgins, whose match against Hawkins was a stodgy, error-ridden affair, said: “I definitely need to raise my game. The good thing is I know what I’ve got to do. It’s one last massive game for the season and I’ll give it everything and see where it takes me. I feel absolutely fine.”

The final is a replay, a decade on, of their 2007 final meeting, when Higgins saw off a 23-year-old Selby who was far from the finished article he is now. “It’s roles reversed,” Higgins said. “Ten years ago I’d have been a big favourite to win but obviously Mark’s the favourite this time and I’m the underdog.

“I’ll be nervous. As you get older I feel the nerves are harder to suppress. I’m sure I’ll be a bag of nerves before it starts but then I’m sure I’ll settle down and we’ll hopefully give everyone a good final.”

Hawkins and Ding headed for home, both magnanimous in defeat.

There was no doubt Hawkins was off his game, and he said: “I think I dragged John down in the end. I played so badly and I think he struggled as well. You won’t find many days when John plays like that, and I didn’t capitalise. It’s just another bad day at the office.”

Ding’s reaction to bowing out to Selby was obvious frustration, given his impressive performance over the last fortnight and the fact he lost to the same opponent in last year’s final.

Ding said: “I’m disappointed to have lost when I played so well but that is sport. Before I missed the blue in the last frame I thought I was going to level at 16-all, but sadly that didn’t happen.

“However I have improved and have been a lot more confident and aggressive here so that is good. On this performance I think Mark Selby is the favourite to win the title.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/29/andy-murray-dominic-thiem-barcelona-open-semi-finals,"Andy Murray’s chequered start to life as the world’s top player continued with a first defeat to Dominic Thiem, the talented ninth-ranked Austrian, in the semi-finals of the Barcelona Open.

Murray, still feeling his way back on to the Tour after more than a month on the sidelines with an elbow injury, was beaten 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 in two hours and 13 minutes. In a match defined by the ups and downs of an opponent whose searing power frequently overshadowed his consistency, Murray fought back from a subdued start but was ultimately edged out by Thiem in a tense finale.

If it was not the outcome that Murray had hoped for, he can at least reflect on a week of solid progress following an inauspicious start to the clay-court season at last week’s Monte Carlo Masters. As for Thiem, through to the seventh final of his career on the red stuff, his first win over a reigning world No1 will be cause for encouragement as he seeks to build on last year’s run to the French Open semi-finals.

Ilie Nastase apologises and says Serena Williams comment was ‘spontaneous’ Read more

As in the previous round against Albert Ramos-Viñolas, his surprise conqueror in Monte Carlo, Murray quickly fell behind. He dropped serve in the opening game, a tentative drop shot perhaps betraying early doubts in the face of some ferocious hitting from Thiem, and the setback set the tone for the remainder of the set. The Austrian’s superior confidence, power and movement earned him two further breaks and, although Murray clawed back the first courtesy of a Thiem double-fault, he rarely looked comfortable.

The Scot sportingly conceded the opening set when another thumping Thiem drive, mistakenly called long, sent him scrambling fruitlessly to his forehand corner. The umpire, Fergus Murphy, called for a let, but Murray generously indicated he would have been unable to put the ball back in play. The top seed soon gave the lie to any suspicion that he was in benevolent mood, however, surviving break points in the first and seventh games of the second set as a nip-and-tuck contest unfolded, more in keeping with their previous two meetings.

The second of Thiem’s two missed chances, which came and went when he lashed a forehand long, seemed to afford Murray a significant boost as he sought to make it three wins in three. Lingering disappointment appeared the only explanation for the glaring errors that followed, the Austrian missing a sitter at deuce in the next game before screwing a forehand wide.

Serving with greater bite and consistency than he had in the opener, when barely half his first deliveries found the court and he won just 17% of the points behind his second, Murray quickly evened the contest. But a rapid exchange of breaks in the opening two games of the decider signalled that the younger man, a semi-finalist at Roland Garros last year, was not about to go away.

So it proved. Thiem rediscovered his early form to move a break ahead and although Murray levelled the match at 4-4 the 23-year-old was not to be denied. He held to move within a game of the final and converted his first match point with a well-judged topspin lob that left Murray flailing.

Thiem will face Rafael Nadal, the winner of the second semi-final. The third seed and nine-times champion defeated Horacio Zeballos of Argentina 6-3, 6-4.

There was better news for British tennis as Aljaz Bedene secured a place in the final of the Hungarian Open with a straight-sets win over Laslo Djere. The British No4 forced two early breaks to take charge of the opening set and went on to close out a 6-2, 6-4 victory in one hour and 19 minutes.

The win was a 16th in succession for Bedene, who secured back-to-back titles on the second-tier Challenger Tour before coming through qualifying in Budapest. Bedene upset second seed Ivo Karlovic in the quarter-finals.

Bedene, 27, was ranked outside the top 100 at the beginning of March, but his winning run promises a return to the top 50 for the Slovenia-born player. In the final, his first on the ATP World Tour since 2015, Bedene will face Lucas Pouille of France, the top seed and world No14, who beat Italy’s Paolo Lorenzi 6-2, 7-5.

When Maria Sharapova began her comeback from a 15-month drug ban in Germany this week, she may have imagined she was returning to the same sporting landscape she left behind at last year’s Australian Open. Kristina Mladenovic, a third-round loser at that event, invited her to consider a rather different reality with a 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 win in their Porsche Grand Prix semi-final in Stuttgart.

While victory would have secured Sharapova’s eligibility for the qualifying competition at next month’s French Open, the former world No1, twice champion at Roland Garros, will now have to rely on the goodwill of Bernard Giudicelli, the French federation president, who talked of the need to “take the right decision” after meeting Sharapova in Los Angeles recently.

Giudicelli will deliver his verdict on 15 May, which should give Sharapova ample time to reflect on this defeat to Mladenovic from a set and a break up. It initially seemed there would be only one winner as Sharapova, who had reached the last four without dropping a set, broke in the fourth game and served flawlessly to see out the opener.

Yet Mladenovic, ranked 19th, has been one of the best players on the Tour this year, winning her first WTA title in St Petersburg, reaching the final in Acapulco and claiming a semi-final place at Indian Wells. She was never likely to be content with a bit-part in the unfolding narrative of Sharapova’s return and, once she belatedly began making inroads on the Russian’s serve in the second set, the momentum slowly began to turn.

“Maria is a tough player, she is very aggressive from the first shot,” reflected Mladenovic at courtside afterwards. “It was not an easy match, but I just tried to fight and it paid off.

“We all know that she has a long career behind her, a lot of experience … but I had my chances and I fought. The most important thing for me was to return her serve – it was really not easy, and that was the key for me. Eventually I managed to put some returns back, put pressure, and be in the rally.”

Awaiting Mladenovic in the final is Laura Siegemund of Germany, the world No49, who upset fourth seed Simona Halep 6-4, 7-5.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/29/castleford-tigers-wigan-warriors-super-league-match-report,"Castleford powered back to the top of the table in style with their biggest Super League win over Wigan. The scrum-half Luke Gale needed to pass a head test before kick-off to take his place in the Tigers side and he gave the Warriors an almighty headache with a 20-point haul, comprising eight goals from nine attempts and one of their nine tries.

This rout enabled Castleford to complete the double over the champions and demonstrate a sizzling return to form after back-to-back defeats by St Helens and Hull had cast some doubt on their title credentials.

The victory topped the Yorkshire club’s previous biggest win over Wigan, a 42-14 success in 2015, and followed a 66-10 rout of Leeds this year.

Wigan had the chance to go top after three successive wins but were dealt a severe blow with the loss of their scrum-half Thomas Leuluai with a broken jaw and little went right for them all night.

Steve Gill, the unlikely chief executive leading the Castleford revival Read more

They had two players sent to the sin-bin and lost three to injury, including the stand-off George Williams; he was subsequently ruled out of England’s Test match against Samoa on Saturday.

Gale, on the other hand, showed he will go into the international in peak form, along with his club-mates Mike McMeeken and Zak Hardaker, while the centre Michael Shenton presented a powerful argument for a place in England’s World Cup squad.

Gale made his mark a minute into the game when he supported a break by Shenton and, although he was hauled down 10 metres short of the line by Morgan Escaré, the Wigan defence could not regroup in time to prevent the loose forward Adam Milner forcing his way over from the resulting play-the-ball.

Shenton then accepted Hardaker’s pass to cross for a try and Gale’s second goal made it 12-0 after only eight minutes.

Both teams suffered early disruption, with the centre Anthony Gelling going off for Wigan and the Castleford stand-off Ben Roberts limping down the tunnel, but the Tigers had the luxury of a like-for-like replacement on the bench in Rangi Chase, who had been on stand-by for Gale.

Willie Isa took Gelling’s place while Chase slotted effortlessly into Castleford’s well-oiled machine as Gale extended their lead to 14-0 with a 19th-minute penalty.

Wigan had prop Frank-Paul Nu’uausala sent to the sin-bin for dissent but scored their only try while down to 12 men, Sam Powell handing off Milner to stroll over the line.

Escaré was wide with the conversion attempt when he had a red haze from a smoke bomb among the Wigan fans behind the posts in his eyeline and they conceded straight away after gifting the ball back to their opponents, substitute Matt Cook bulldozing his way over with his first touch of the ball.

McMeeken showed his class with a fend on Williams and a nice turn of pace to stroll through for Castleford’s next try as Gale extended the lead to 26-4 by the break.

Wigan’s debutant hooker Josh Ganson, son of the referees’ chief Steve Ganson, was unfortunate to have a try disallowed just before half-time when the in-goal judge ruled he failed to ground the ball, and any hope of a revival disappeared when Williams failed to re-appear for the second half.

Things went from bad to worse for Wigan when Escaré was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle on Gale and this time they conceded three tries while down to 12 men.

Winger Greg Minikin took Chase’s cut-out pass to score his 11th try of the campaign, while Gale grabbed his 10th after working a one-two with Grant Millington, who supported a break by hooker Paul McShane to go over on 52 minutes.

More slick handling led the centre Jake Webster to power his way over wide out and Hardaker sent Minikin over for his second of the match as the Tigers piled on the agony for their stricken visitors, who had Flower carried off on 59 minutes.

https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-gets-personal-in-one-off-campaign-speech,"Labour leader departs from usual focus on issues and policies by talking about his personal history and motivations

Jeremy Corbyn has diverted from his usual campaign stump speech to deliver a rare retelling of his personal history, his motivations and his views on leadership.

The speech at his former university in London recalled the election tactics of the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and former Conservative prime minister John Major, who released video biographies in an attempt to woo voters. Taking questions from the press and audience afterwards, Corbyn denied the speech was a rebranding exercise and insisted it was a one-off.

Jeremy Corbyn election bid to promote ‘warmer’ style of leadership Read more

“As you know, I am very averse to talking about myself and that has been the story of my life … I am not going to spend the whole election campaign talking about myself any more, so you had the chance today,” he said.

Labour strategists are keen to contrast what they portray as a cold Conservative prime minister with what they see as Corbyn’s warmer personality. They are also anxious to contrast his willingness to take questions from the media with what they claim is Theresa May’s avoidance of scrutiny.

Speaking at the London Metropolitan University in front of about 200 people, most of them Labour supporters, he began: “This morning I’m going to say a few words about you, and even some about me.”

After lengthy passages about the Conservatives’ impact on living standards, he said: “And now for a sentence I’ve yet to utter in my political life. Enough about you, what about me?”

Throughout his 34 years as an MP, he had been attacked for what he believed in, he said, but it had not changed his core values.

Many of the problems he identified at the start his career were still present. “In 1983, I stood up in parliament for the first time and used my maiden speech to condemn deeply damaging cuts in public services and the NHS. It’s a tragedy that I could make a very similar speech today and it would once again hold true.”

He said he believed being an MP could bring profound and lasting change and recalled his early days as a parliamentarian. “At the time, young protesters were being shot dead on the streets by the racist apartheid regime in South Africa. Nelson Mandela and hundreds of ANC leaders were in prison. The Conservative government refused to impose sanctions, entertained the leaders of the regime and banned protests outside the South African embassy in London,” he said.

“Being an MP helped bring attention to that ban and the wider cause of South Africa’s liberation, and got a group of us arrested. But the space for people in Britain to organise in support of freedom in South Africa was defended and strengthened. And I realised then that political leaders can, if they want to, create and preserve the space for others to organise and transform countries.”

His yardstick for measuring the performance of Labour and Conservative governments over the last three decades was the extent to which they dealt with unfairness and created a better society, he said.

“In that time, I’ve seen prime ministers and leaders of the opposition come and go, but for all their achievements and failures, what I didn’t see was a sustained attempt to rid this country of what really holds people back. I never heard a clear invitation for everyone in the country to work together and create a real alternative to our rigged economy,” he said.

“So when I was asked to put my name forward in Labour’s 2015 leadership election, I felt I should step up.”

As leader he said he had forced the government into U-turns on tax credits, disability payments and attempts to increase national insurance for the self-employed.

On his leadership philosophy, he said his critics had a right to make a reasoned case and challenge him. If leaders go unchallenged, they can make some of the most damaging mistakes, he said. ”And if party leaders put themselves ahead of serving the people, they stop listening and even put our country at risk.”

He said there were signs the prime minister and her closest advisers were slipping into a presidential bunker mentality. “Whereas it is the job of leadership to hold open the space for dissent, new thinking and fit-for-purpose policy,” he said.

“Whereas insecure leaders want to feel stronger by asking you to give them more power, I recognise strong leadership as equipping you with more power.”

He said he would not allow free thinking to be “shut down by a hostile media or an elite that scoffs at anyone who dares to step out of line”.

He used the speech to make a plea for 2.4 million young people missing from the UK’s electoral register to sign up. He said barely 40% of 18 to 24-year olds turn out to vote.

“The Conservatives are more than happy with this state of affairs. Apathy and resignation will secure them seats on election day,” he said.",guardian.com,False

It is not as though the plight of the Palestinians has been forgotten or that the threats Israelis face have suddenly diminished. It is that, in the total absence of progress towards a settlement, other events have taken precedence. One is the spread of Islamist fundamentalism, principally in the form of al-Qaida and Isis. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the US redirected energy and resources towards Iraq and Afghanistan. The Arab spring revolts of 2011 also shifted the spotlight away from Palestine and on to the grievances of Arab citizens towards their own governments. Shaky Arab regimes discovered shared interests with Israel that outweighed old loyalties to the Palestinians.

Syria’s civil war has encompassed all these noxious elements – jihadi extremism, popular insurrection, governmental repression, military atrocities and social breakdown, leading to massive refugee outflows and humanitarian emergencies. Set against this enormous conflict, drawing in Russia, Iran and religious fanatics from both sides of the Sunni-Shia divide, the Palestinian problem has paled by comparison. The west’s chronic indecision over Syria, highlighted last week by Boris Johnson’s irresponsible and foolish remarks about British military action, underscores how little faith should be placed in its determination to secure a Palestinian deal.

It would be wrong to suggest the US and others have stopped trying. John Kerry, former secretary of state, pushed hard to revive the moribund peace process. The French hosted an international conference in January to promote a two-state solution, still the only workable way forward. The meeting’s final statement called on Israel to withdraw to its 1967 borders and relinquish control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as required by UN resolutions, and appealed to both parties to “abstain from unilateral actions” that could jeopardise future negotiations.

Such self-evidently sensible appeals, heard so many times before, are futile unless backed by active measures to persuade and coerce the main players. These are currently lacking. In Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel has a confrontational prime minister whose narrow, inflexible vision of what best assures Israel’s security is itself a danger to the country he serves. In Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinians have a weak, ineffective leader whose authority is undermined by Hamas. Neither man is a credible partner for peace. Neither seems to have a viable plan for ending the impasse. When Abbas meets Donald Trump in Washington this week, perhaps he will surprise us. Perhaps Trump will have something constructive to say. Or not.

Trump is correct about one thing. Speaking last week, he declared there was “no reason” why Israelis and Palestinians should not live in peace. And, in plain terms, if both sides are prepared to compromise – and possible compromises on land, borders, security, refugees and Jerusalem have been rehearsed – Trump is right. What is needed, and is lacking, is brave, imaginative leadership.

Despite his violent history, Marwan Barghouti, organiser of the prison hunger strike, is regarded by many Palestinians as one of their most able leaders. Many outsiders who wish Israel well also share that opinion and would like to see him take a more active public role, freed from his prison shackles. Barghouti’s recent op-ed in the New York Times likened the Palestinian struggle to independence movements in South Africa and elsewhere. One thing they all shared, he suggested, was the inevitability of ultimate victory. Palestinians, he wrote, were engaged in “a long walk to freedom”.

Barghouti is no Nelson Mandela. But neither can his claims and those of his people be indefinitely deferred. Trying to do so risks another explosion – another nakba – that, for all the wrong reasons, would again place Palestine at the forefront of Middle East woes.

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/30/man-arrested-after-48-year-old-stabbed-to-death-on-london-bus,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 48-year-old man who was stabbed to death on a bus.

Archie Sheppard, from Neasden, north-west London, was subjected to a “violent and sustained attack” on the top deck of a No 189 bus before being discovered by a passenger.

Police and paramedics were called to the bus in Gloucester Place, Marylebone, at 12.10am on Friday but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

On Saturday detectives arrested a 38-year-old man in Mulgrave Road, Fulham, south-west London, on suspicion of murder. He was also detained on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon.

Scotland Yard appealed for help in searching for a white male seen with Sheppard shortly before he boarded the bus in Brent Cross, north London, at 11.13pm on Thursday.

The man then fled the bus as it reached Gloucester Place and the junction with Montagu Place, heading in the direction of Marble Arch, police said.

DCI Noel McHugh, said: “It is important that we establish and get a clearer picture as to who Mr Sheppard was and the lifestyle he was leading, in particular anyone who was with him on Thursday 27 April and anyone who stayed at his home in Neasden.

“I am also making a fresh appeal for information and witnesses to come forward. A number of people have assisted us with our inquiry but there are still a number of witnesses that have yet to come forward and I believe that they could hold vital information that could help with progressing this investigation.”

A postmortem examination was due to take place on Saturday.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or the events leading up to the murder should contact the police incident room on 020 8785 8099 or via Twitter @MetCC. Information can also be reported anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their website.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/29/city-mayors-heal-brexit-divisions-integration,"Britain’s leading expert on social cohesion has backed calls for a radical new approach to heal deepening divisions in the post-Brexit-vote era.

Professor Ted Cantle, author of a groundbreaking report commissioned by the government after the 2001 race riots in northern England, has backed calls for the mayors of the six new city regions being created across England in local elections on Thursday to appoint deputies responsible for improving relations between different community groups. The approach has been adopted by a number of major global cities with considerable success.

“We need unity more than ever to respond to those that seek to create divisions,” Cantle said. “Deputy mayors can begin to build bridges and create a real sense of belonging in their areas and, most of all, to develop practical actions to help all communities come to terms with change and build a common purpose.”

Cantle was speaking before the release of a new report from British Future, an independent thinktank established to promote social cohesion. The report, Integration: From National Rhetoric to Local Reality, suggests that there is an “integration policy vacuum” at the heart of government which the new mayors of Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, Liverpool City Region, Tees Valley, Cambridgeshire & Peterborough, and the West of England can help fill.

The idea has already been implemented by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. In New York the mayor’s office of immigration affairs now offers a broad range of initiatives, from language provision to advice for new arrivals. In Barcelona, where one in five residents was born outside Spain, the city authority has created a department of “immigration and inter-culturality” to promote Spanish language learning and social connectedness.

“Integration cannot be left to chance. It needs champions in every town and city – and all have different local issues which a deputy mayor can recognise and support,” Cantle said.

“The deputy mayor can also create a real sense of partnership and purpose and bring together local businesses, schools, housing associations, faith organisations and local and voluntary agencies.”

Cantle has for some time warned that British society is dividing along ethnic lines – with segregation appearing across schools, neighbourhoods and workplaces. There are now concerns that Brexit has exacerbated those tensions in some parts of the country.

British Future said it had identified integration problems in each of the six new combined authorities. In Greater Manchester, particularly in Oldham and Rochdale, it claims there is a need for using new housing powers to address the geographic segregation of different faith and ethnic communities.

In the west of England it calls for improving education and employment prospects for young Caribbean and Somali people. And in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, it said there was a need to address social and educational divides.

Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, said a new approach was long overdue. “We have never put in place a proper integration strategy in this country. Yet getting integration right so we live well together matters to everyone in Britain. It’s a big part of the immigration anxieties that played out in the Brexit vote and that parties must respond to in the general election.

“Governments need to get it right, but integration mostly happens in the towns and cities where we live. The new mayors could be game-changers for integration in the six city regions that go to the polls this week – understanding the specific integration challenges of their region and with wide-ranging powers and budgets to address them. Appointing a deputy mayor for integration would show that the new mayors take integration seriously, and give responsibility to a high-profile individual to make it work across their region.”

Last week MPs, educationalists and civil society leaders in the West Midlands signed a joint letter to the Birmingham Mail urging candidates to support the appointment of a deputy mayor for integration.

Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston and one of the signatories, said: “Communities are at their best when they live with each other, not just alongside each other. The Midlands has a lot to be proud of at a city level, but making this happen across the region will require a conscious effort. A deputy mayor will be ideally placed to achieve just that.”

Sabir Zazai, chief executive of Coventry refugee and migrant centre, said the West Midlands was one of the most ethnically diverse regions in Britain, and had a longstanding tradition of welcoming people from across the world: “I am proud of the benefits this diversity has brought in aiding the development of the region, but also aware it brings difficult and sensitive challenges for the new mayor. It is essential that these issues are dealt with openly and constructively, and that’s why I am supporting British Future’s proposal for the mayor to appoint a deputy for social integration.”",guardian.com,False

The doomed plan for a garden bridge across the Thames has been defended by one of the project’s strongest proponents, the actor Joanna Lumley.

The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, effectively pulled the plug on the controversial plan on Friday, announcing that he would not provide the vital financial guarantees needed for construction to begin.

The garden bridge is dead – now £37m of public money must be repaid Read more

The Garden Bridge Trust, which is responsible for realising Thomas Heatherwick’s design, vowed to fight on despite Khan’s decision, pinning its hopes on persuading another public body, such as the Department for Transport, to step in as guarantor.

Lumley, who is well known as Patsy in BBC sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, originally devised the proposal for a garden over the Thames featuring hundreds of trees and thousands of other plants, winning support from Boris Johnson, Khan’s predecessor as mayor and the then chancellor, George Osborne.

Speaking to the Times newspaper, Lumley said Khan’s decision to remove financial backing was “absolutely shattering, devastating”.

“The negativity troubles me in my heart. I hope we’re not turning into the sort of country that instantly says no before it considers saying yes,” she said. “A nation that just pulls the shutters down. The silent majority still love the bridge, but of course they were not asked what they think.”



Osborne committed £60m of public funding to the scheme when he was in office. The Department for Transport has already given £30m and Transport for London contributed £30m, £20m of which structured as a loan.

In a study of the project commissioned by city hall, the Labour MP Margaret Hodge found the bridge was likely to cost more than £200m, and that £37.4m of public funds had already been spent without any building work taking place.

Lumley told the Times the project had been politicised. “There was so much negativity about this £60m of public money,” she said. “All we heard was £60m, £60m, £60m. But . . . it’ll work out at about 32p a person in the UK. It’s not as if we’re stealing bread from people.”

In a letter to Lord Davies, the Labour life peer and former government minister who chairs the trust, Khan said the cash had been spent before final land agreements had been sealed.

Khan wrote: “It is concerning that a huge amount of effort and expenditure has been expended on other aspects of the project when there is a real possibility that agreement will not be reached before the expiry of planning permission, or at all.”



Responding to Khan’s decision, Davies said the trust had received the letter with great regret.

“We will study the contents of the letter in detail before responding formally. The Garden Bridge Trust was set up at the request of Transport for London and the Department of Transport to deliver the project which had received public money,” he said.

“We have had enormous support from our funders and are very confident we can raise the remaining funds required. But sadly, the mayor of London has taken a different decision to those in place when the project started.”",guardian.com,False

Tom Harrison, who goes by the name Mr Gorilla, is raising money for the Gorilla Organisation. The 41-year-old Londoner started at 10.34am on Sunday and crossed the finish line at 11.45am on Saturday.

He has slept at friends’ houses in the evenings after completing about 10 to 12 hours and 4.5 miles per day and has swapped between crawling on hands and knees and up on hands and feet to save his blistered knees.

Harrison crossed the finish line on the Mall flanked by his two sons and beating his chest. He said: “It was tough at points, but I am really glad I did it.”

The Putney-based police officer said he had run the marathon in the gorilla suit last year, but this time wanted to do “that little bit more”. He said: “The first couple of days, people were giving me weird looks and a wide berth. But by day three more people had started hearing about it: I started getting people beeping their horns and clapping and cheering.”

On his unique view of the capital over the past seven days, he said: “One thing I noticed was that being at exhaust height, it was really catching my throat. You just notice the pollution side of things that much more.

“The other thing was just how limited my view was. I had helpers in front of me telling me to go left, right and so on so that I didn’t hit lamp-posts or trees.”

Harrison said he was most looking forward to getting a massage for his aching shoulders, and having a cup of coffee, as it had upset his stomach during the race. “Your stomach is not used to being in that position, so it gave me a bit of heartburn,” he said.

He was met at the finish line by Gorilla Organisation chair Ian Redmond and conservationist Bill Oddie, who handed him a trophy and a stuffed gorilla.

The Gorilla Organisation is dedicated to conserving gorillas in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Harrison’s JustGiving page for his marathon effort has so far raised more than £23,000 for the charity.

In his costume, the police officer has taken part in a series of fundraisers for the cause, including the Great Gorilla Run, Tough Mudder and running the same marathon last year.

“He’s just this incredible personality who seems to me to be absolutely fearless, but he loves the gorillas.” said Jillian Miller, the charity’s director. “I thought he was mad at first, but you know when Tom sets his heart to do something, he absolutely does it.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/29/recycle-nespresso-coffee-pods-london,"Coffee company Nespresso – part of Swiss multinational Nestlé – is to trial a scheme for consumers to recycle their used aluminium capsules for the first time in the UK, in the face of a growing environmental backlash against increasingly popular single-serve pods, many of which end up in landfill.

A six-month pilot, starting this week in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, will allow Nespresso Club members to recycle their used capsules through their council household recycling service, using special purple bags provided by the company. The borough’s 190,000 residents will only be able to put out capsules made by Nespresso.

Most other capsules on the market are not made of aluminium, usually consisting of mixed plastic and sometimes foil, which require different recycling processes. The dregs of leftover coffee remaining in the pod also make them difficult to process in standard municipal recycling plants. Nespresso has defended its use of aluminium, saying it helps keep the coffee fresh.

The company said it was responding to its users, who have requested more convenient recycling through their local council-run scheme. The trial is part of a project to give customers more convenient recycling options.

“We launched our own dedicated recycling services seven years ago,” said Francisco Nogueira, managing director of Nespresso UK and Ireland. “Every week we are seeing an increase in the volume of capsules being sent in by customers through our system. But we know there is still much to be done and recycling through the municipal system is something our members have asked for.”

The bags of aluminium capsules will be sent to Nespresso’s recycling facility in Congleton, while the waste coffee grounds will be extracted and turned into compost. Nespresso capsules are included in other national recycling schemes such as the Green Dot programme in Germany as well as in a number of other countries, including France and Canada. But in the German city of Hamburg coffee capsules have been banned from state-run buildings as part of a drive to cut waste.

Nespresso introduced the first single-serve coffee machine in 1986, initially using only its own-brand pods. But after Nespresso’s patents began to expire in 2012, competitors started to offer capsules and machines compatible with the Nespresso system.

Nestle would not say what proportion of its capsules are recycled, instead focusing on its recycling “capacity” – which it says is 100%. Market research company Mintel estimated the UK coffee pods market to be worth £182m in 2016 in its most recent study, up from £158m in 2015, and forecast to reach £206m this year. According to their research, 29% of Britons own a coffee pod machine.

The move was welcomed by Trewin Restorick, chief executive of environmental charity Hubbub, who said: “Nespresso pods are mainly aluminium and can be recycled whereas many of their competitors’ pods are mixed plastic which currently can’t be recycled. But using aluminium only makes sense from a resource point of view if the discarded aluminium is recycled, otherwise it is a very carbon intensive way for consumers to get their coffee. Nespresso needs to scale up the recycling process quickly.”

The company’s long-term ambition, a Nespresso spokeswoman said, was to enable more recycling of used capsules via council collection services.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/29/cancer-surgeon-scandal-widens-victims-name-other-hospitals-doctors,"The scandal surrounding the rogue surgeon Ian Paterson is likely to widen after lawyers revealed on Saturday that they are receiving allegations implicating other hospitals and specialists.

On Friday, Paterson, 59, a consultant surgeon, was found guilty of carrying out needless breast operations in a scandal that has forced the NHS to pay almost £10m in compensation to more than 250 of his patients, though the true number of victims could eventually run into the thousands.

Paterson was convicted of 17 counts of wounding with intent, relating to nine women and one man in the West Midlands, with the jury at Nottingham crown court deciding the surgeon carried out “extensive, life-changing operations for no medically justifiable reason” on them between 1997 and 2011.

The law firm Slater and Gordon said that in the aftermath of Paterson’s conviction it was already receiving calls from potential victims alleging needless operations and naming other individual clinicians and hospitals.

Emma Doughty, clinical negligence solicitor at the London law firm, said: “It’s amazing that since yesterday people have come forward. I’ve already had three or four more people contacting me about things that have happened in other places, so I think there’s a lot more people out there, different individuals and different surgeries.”

Doughty said: “I’m sure there are other surgeons doing not very nice things in other places, purely because of what I’ve learned in relation to the private sector and how it’s managed. I’m sure there are other people who can get away with doing other things, not necessarily on [Paterson’s] scale, but that remains to be seen.”

It was also confirmed On Saturday that 350 women were now seeking compensation and bringing a high court case against Paterson, who was described in court by one victim as being “like God”, with the jury hearing that he carried out the operations for “obscure motives” which possibly might have included a financial incentive. The surgeon, who treated thousands of patients during his career, exaggerated or invented cancer risks and claimed payments for more expensive procedures in some cases.

Paterson, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was also found guilty of three counts of unlawful wounding.

The seven-week trial heard the accounts of 10 victims – representing a sample of those Paterson treated – operated on at the privately run Little Aston and Parkway hospitals in the West Midlands.

Doughty said the case demonstrated the need for an independent inquiry into the private health sector, adding that there was far too little official scrutiny of such practices.

“There should be an independent inquiry, certainly in relation to the private sector. There should be much more regulation regarding the intertwining of the NHS and the private sector. We’re doing all we can with the civil proceedings to find out what happened, but there’s a limit to what the civil case can do to ensure safeguards are put in place.”

A review of the Heart of England NHS trust, which covers the West Midlands, revealed that a senior clinician raised concerns about Paterson’s mastectomies in 2004, meaning that there was a seven-year delay in stopping him operating on women with breast cancer.

Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who looked into the case, said, if the concerns had been acted on then, a “proper analysis of Paterson’s performance would have been instituted”.

Kennedy added: “It is very likely that the result would have been that Paterson would have been required to stop operating on women with breast cancer by the end of 2004 at the latest.”

Doughty said: “It’s clear that we need much more regulation in the private sector. The Kennedy review for the NHS was very thorough, but we’ve not had the same in the private sector yet.”

Jurors were not told Paterson carried out hundreds of unnecessary operations on NHS patients, with a hospital trust paying out £17.8m in damages and legal costs. He was granted bail and is due to be sentenced in May.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/29/marine-a-alexander-blackman-enjoys-first-hours-of-freedom,"Alexander Blackman, the Royal Marine sergeant convicted of killing a wounded Taliban fighter, has been enjoying his first hours of freedom but has made it clear he understands his sentence is not complete and has promised to fulfil the conditions of his early release.

Blackman was freed from prison after serving half of the seven-year term imposed for manslaughter and was whisked away to a luxury country hideaway arranged by the Daily Mail, which backed his legal fight.



He told the tabloid: “Being out of prison is an immense feeling but I am very conscious that my sentence is not complete. I have been released on licence and there are certain conditions which I must – and will – respect.

“But it is the little things I can enjoy. Suddenly I can sleep when I want, eat when I want, go for a walk ... this freedom of choice over basic things is going to take some getting used to.”

Typically prisoners on licence have to stay in close touch with a supervisor, seek permission before travelling out of the UK and get approval for any work they take on. Misbehaviour can result in a return to jail.

Blackman described his wife, who led the campaign to free him, as a “wife in a million”. He said: “I will be eternally grateful to Claire and I cannot put into words how wonderful she is.

“Other inmates often said how lucky I was to have her fighting so hard for me. I don’t think there is anybody who has witnessed the effort she has gone to who will doubt how she feels about me, and that’s beyond words really. You just can’t imagine anyone cares for you that much.”

Claire Blackman told the Mail she had felt a “surge of happiness” when her husband arrived at the country bolthole, describing their reunion as “like a dream”.

“We have spent so long on this rollercoaster ride and have always steeled ourselves for the worst-case scenario,” she said. “Now we have got Al out, the result we always hoped for, it is taking time to sink in.”

Blackman was convicted in 2013 of murdering a Taliban prisoner while on tour in Helmand province in Afghanistan, and jailed for life. The conviction was quashed when the court martial appeal court ruled he had been suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the shooting in 2011.

His conviction was replaced with manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and his sentence reduced from life to seven years.

He was smuggled out of prison in Wiltshire in the early hours of Friday and was taken to a rural hideaway, where according to the Mail, he was treated to Hungarian goose-down duvets, roaring fires and roll-top baths.

He has been offered a job by the former marine John Davies, who also campaigned for Blackman to be freed, as an instructor in his maritime training business.

The Guardian has also learned that Blackman has enjoyed writing while in prison and may try to get a children’s story about a cuddly mole published.

According to his lawyer, Jonathan Goldberg QC, there is also interest from Hollywood in making a film of the saga.

Blackman is still entitled to a military pension and supporters have raised money to help him and his wife set themselves up.

The documentary-maker and honorary marine Chris Terrill, who has become close to the Blackmans, said he believed there would be a tricky transition period for the marine.

He said: “It is going to be a difficult transition. Al hasn’t been a civilian for many years.” Terrill also said there would also be a time of readjustment for husband and wife. “I was joking with Claire that they’ll have to work out who is going to control the television zapper.”

He said the idea of a Hollywood film with a star-studded cast was fanciful. “This is not the time to be talking about Hollywood blockbusters,” he said. “It’s a great time for the Blackmans, but it’s a very serious time, too.”

Terrill said it was worth remembering the man Blackman had killed. “He was someone’s son, brother, possibly husband.”

Life will never be the same for the Blackmans. The Guardian revealed last month that police had warned them they could be terrorist targets and they have been advised to take a series of precautions including changing their identities and moving house.

Supporters across the country will celebrate Blackman’s release this bank holiday weekend.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/catholic-bishops-pressed-to-review-celibacy-rules-shortage-of-priests,"Call for commission to reconsider celibacy as condition of priesthood as number of priests in England and Wales plummets

Catholic bishops in England and Wales are facing a fresh call for a national commission on the ordination of married men amid mounting concern that the church’s celibacy requirement is contributing to a shortage of priests.

The call for a review of celibacy as a condition of priesthood comes after Pope Francis signalled last month he was open to the possibility of ordaining married men under specific conditions. The issue is expected to raised at a synod next year on vocation.



The Movement for Married Clergy (MMaC) is renewing its call for a national commission of bishops, clergy and laity to discuss ways of tackling the shortage of priests. “We’re asking bishops to recognise the issue and examine possible solutions in good faith,” said the MMaC secretary, Chris McDonnell.



A recent editorial in the Catholic Times endorsed the call. “What has the church got to lose by establishing such a commission? Or perhaps more importantly, the focus should concentrate on what the church has to gain from such a move,” it said.



According to Catholic church figures, 25 men entered training for the diocesan priesthood in 2016 for England and Wales compared with more than 150 in 1985, although the pace of decline has slowed in recent years.



“We have a very advancing age profile of serving priests, and low numbers of people going into seminaries,” said McDonnell. “At the moment, it’s just about manageable. But in five years’ time it’s going to be very different. We want to use this window of opportunity to look at what could be done.”

Last year it was announced that a third of the 62 Catholic churches in north Wales would close by 2020 because of a shortage of priests under the retirement age. In January, Salford diocese said more than 20 churches across Greater Manchester would close and about 100 parishes would merge, partly because of falling numbers of priests.



The MMaC said Pope Francis’s comments suggested a new openness to the idea of married priests. In a separate interview, Cardinal Walter Kasper, a German theologian close to Francis, said the pope wanted to leave the decision up to local bishops’ conferences.



“The [vocation] situation differs so widely in different parts of the world that a uniform worldwide solution is not possible,” Kasper told a German church website, katholisch.de. Each bishops’ conference should decide whether it was in favour of married priests and then submit proposals to the pope. “I have the feeling that if their application is well-founded, it will be met positively.”



He added: “We simply cannot carry on with the situation as it is at the present … One cannot just go on clustering more and more parishes together into ever larger entities.”



Celibacy is a matter of church discipline rather than doctrine, and Catholic priests were often married up until the 12th century. In the UK, married Anglican clergy who joined the Catholic church in disagreement over the ordination of women have continued to serve as priests.



“I think the vast majority of lay Catholics would accept married clergy – particularly young people for whom it is a no-brainer,” said McDonnell. “But we want to be very clear that we’re not rejecting celibacy. If a man decides as part of his vocation to be celibate, we’d applaud his dedication. Celibacy and the priesthood should not be considered incompatible.”



Two of the church’s 22 serving bishops, Tom Burns of Menevia and Seamus Cunningham of Hexham and Newcastle, and three retired bishops have backed married priests in recent years. However, the bishops’ conference of England and Wales rejected a proposal to ordain married men in 2015.



Cardinal Vincent Nichols, archbishop of Westminster and leader of the church in England and Wales, has said he sees no need for change. “I don’t think we are in a [vocations] crisis in England and Wales.” he told the Irish Catholic in February. adding: “I personally value … the celibacy of the priesthood.”



Father Christopher Jamison of the Catholic National Office for Vocation said he had “no problem” with the ordination of married men, but “it does not solve the fundamental challenges facing churches today”. He pointed out that the Anglican church ordained married men and women yet still faced a clergy shortage and declining congregations.



Pope Francis has said the next synod in October 2018 will discuss the decline in vocations. Reports have suggested the pope wanted the issue of celibacy to be discussed but yielded to objections from his advisers.

The doomed plan for a garden bridge across the Thames has been defended by one of the project’s strongest proponents, the actor Joanna Lumley.

The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, effectively pulled the plug on the controversial plan on Friday, announcing that he would not provide the vital financial guarantees needed for construction to begin.

The garden bridge is dead – now £37m of public money must be repaid Read more

The Garden Bridge Trust, which is responsible for realising Thomas Heatherwick’s design, vowed to fight on despite Khan’s decision, pinning its hopes on persuading another public body, such as the Department for Transport, to step in as guarantor.

Lumley, who is well known as Patsy in BBC sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, originally devised the proposal for a garden over the Thames featuring hundreds of trees and thousands of other plants, winning support from Boris Johnson, Khan’s predecessor as mayor and the then chancellor, George Osborne.

Speaking to the Times newspaper, Lumley said Khan’s decision to remove financial backing was “absolutely shattering, devastating”.

“The negativity troubles me in my heart. I hope we’re not turning into the sort of country that instantly says no before it considers saying yes,” she said. “A nation that just pulls the shutters down. The silent majority still love the bridge, but of course they were not asked what they think.”



Osborne committed £60m of public funding to the scheme when he was in office. The Department for Transport has already given £30m and Transport for London contributed £30m, £20m of which structured as a loan.

In a study of the project commissioned by city hall, the Labour MP Margaret Hodge found the bridge was likely to cost more than £200m, and that £37.4m of public funds had already been spent without any building work taking place.

Lumley told the Times the project had been politicised. “There was so much negativity about this £60m of public money,” she said. “All we heard was £60m, £60m, £60m. But . . . it’ll work out at about 32p a person in the UK. It’s not as if we’re stealing bread from people.”

In a letter to Lord Davies, the Labour life peer and former government minister who chairs the trust, Khan said the cash had been spent before final land agreements had been sealed.

Khan wrote: “It is concerning that a huge amount of effort and expenditure has been expended on other aspects of the project when there is a real possibility that agreement will not be reached before the expiry of planning permission, or at all.”



Responding to Khan’s decision, Davies said the trust had received the letter with great regret.

“We will study the contents of the letter in detail before responding formally. The Garden Bridge Trust was set up at the request of Transport for London and the Department of Transport to deliver the project which had received public money,” he said.

“We have had enormous support from our funders and are very confident we can raise the remaining funds required. But sadly, the mayor of London has taken a different decision to those in place when the project started.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/29/gorilla-organisation-london-marathon-tom-harrison,"A Metropolitan police officer who has been crawling the London Marathon in a gorilla costume since the race began on Sunday morning has completed the 26-mile route.

Don’t insult gorillas by comparing them to Donald Trump | Ros Coward Read more

Tom Harrison, who goes by the name Mr Gorilla, is raising money for the Gorilla Organisation. The 41-year-old Londoner started at 10.34am on Sunday and crossed the finish line at 11.45am on Saturday.

He has slept at friends’ houses in the evenings after completing about 10 to 12 hours and 4.5 miles per day and has swapped between crawling on hands and knees and up on hands and feet to save his blistered knees.

Harrison crossed the finish line on the Mall flanked by his two sons and beating his chest. He said: “It was tough at points, but I am really glad I did it.”

The Putney-based police officer said he had run the marathon in the gorilla suit last year, but this time wanted to do “that little bit more”. He said: “The first couple of days, people were giving me weird looks and a wide berth. But by day three more people had started hearing about it: I started getting people beeping their horns and clapping and cheering.”

On his unique view of the capital over the past seven days, he said: “One thing I noticed was that being at exhaust height, it was really catching my throat. You just notice the pollution side of things that much more.

“The other thing was just how limited my view was. I had helpers in front of me telling me to go left, right and so on so that I didn’t hit lamp-posts or trees.”

Harrison said he was most looking forward to getting a massage for his aching shoulders, and having a cup of coffee, as it had upset his stomach during the race. “Your stomach is not used to being in that position, so it gave me a bit of heartburn,” he said.

He was met at the finish line by Gorilla Organisation chair Ian Redmond and conservationist Bill Oddie, who handed him a trophy and a stuffed gorilla.

The Gorilla Organisation is dedicated to conserving gorillas in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Harrison’s JustGiving page for his marathon effort has so far raised more than £23,000 for the charity.

In his costume, the police officer has taken part in a series of fundraisers for the cause, including the Great Gorilla Run, Tough Mudder and running the same marathon last year.

“He’s just this incredible personality who seems to me to be absolutely fearless, but he loves the gorillas.” said Jillian Miller, the charity’s director. “I thought he was mad at first, but you know when Tom sets his heart to do something, he absolutely does it.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/29/recycle-nespresso-coffee-pods-london,"Coffee company Nespresso – part of Swiss multinational Nestlé – is to trial a scheme for consumers to recycle their used aluminium capsules for the first time in the UK, in the face of a growing environmental backlash against increasingly popular single-serve pods, many of which end up in landfill.

A six-month pilot, starting this week in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, will allow Nespresso Club members to recycle their used capsules through their council household recycling service, using special purple bags provided by the company. The borough’s 190,000 residents will only be able to put out capsules made by Nespresso.

Most other capsules on the market are not made of aluminium, usually consisting of mixed plastic and sometimes foil, which require different recycling processes. The dregs of leftover coffee remaining in the pod also make them difficult to process in standard municipal recycling plants. Nespresso has defended its use of aluminium, saying it helps keep the coffee fresh.

The company said it was responding to its users, who have requested more convenient recycling through their local council-run scheme. The trial is part of a project to give customers more convenient recycling options.

“We launched our own dedicated recycling services seven years ago,” said Francisco Nogueira, managing director of Nespresso UK and Ireland. “Every week we are seeing an increase in the volume of capsules being sent in by customers through our system. But we know there is still much to be done and recycling through the municipal system is something our members have asked for.”

The bags of aluminium capsules will be sent to Nespresso’s recycling facility in Congleton, while the waste coffee grounds will be extracted and turned into compost. Nespresso capsules are included in other national recycling schemes such as the Green Dot programme in Germany as well as in a number of other countries, including France and Canada. But in the German city of Hamburg coffee capsules have been banned from state-run buildings as part of a drive to cut waste.

Nespresso introduced the first single-serve coffee machine in 1986, initially using only its own-brand pods. But after Nespresso’s patents began to expire in 2012, competitors started to offer capsules and machines compatible with the Nespresso system.

Nestle would not say what proportion of its capsules are recycled, instead focusing on its recycling “capacity” – which it says is 100%. Market research company Mintel estimated the UK coffee pods market to be worth £182m in 2016 in its most recent study, up from £158m in 2015, and forecast to reach £206m this year. According to their research, 29% of Britons own a coffee pod machine.

The move was welcomed by Trewin Restorick, chief executive of environmental charity Hubbub, who said: “Nespresso pods are mainly aluminium and can be recycled whereas many of their competitors’ pods are mixed plastic which currently can’t be recycled. But using aluminium only makes sense from a resource point of view if the discarded aluminium is recycled, otherwise it is a very carbon intensive way for consumers to get their coffee. Nespresso needs to scale up the recycling process quickly.”

The company’s long-term ambition, a Nespresso spokeswoman said, was to enable more recycling of used capsules via council collection services.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/29/cancer-surgeon-scandal-widens-victims-name-other-hospitals-doctors,"The scandal surrounding the rogue surgeon Ian Paterson is likely to widen after lawyers revealed on Saturday that they are receiving allegations implicating other hospitals and specialists.

On Friday, Paterson, 59, a consultant surgeon, was found guilty of carrying out needless breast operations in a scandal that has forced the NHS to pay almost £10m in compensation to more than 250 of his patients, though the true number of victims could eventually run into the thousands.

Paterson was convicted of 17 counts of wounding with intent, relating to nine women and one man in the West Midlands, with the jury at Nottingham crown court deciding the surgeon carried out “extensive, life-changing operations for no medically justifiable reason” on them between 1997 and 2011.

The law firm Slater and Gordon said that in the aftermath of Paterson’s conviction it was already receiving calls from potential victims alleging needless operations and naming other individual clinicians and hospitals.

Emma Doughty, clinical negligence solicitor at the London law firm, said: “It’s amazing that since yesterday people have come forward. I’ve already had three or four more people contacting me about things that have happened in other places, so I think there’s a lot more people out there, different individuals and different surgeries.”

Doughty said: “I’m sure there are other surgeons doing not very nice things in other places, purely because of what I’ve learned in relation to the private sector and how it’s managed. I’m sure there are other people who can get away with doing other things, not necessarily on [Paterson’s] scale, but that remains to be seen.”

It was also confirmed On Saturday that 350 women were now seeking compensation and bringing a high court case against Paterson, who was described in court by one victim as being “like God”, with the jury hearing that he carried out the operations for “obscure motives” which possibly might have included a financial incentive. The surgeon, who treated thousands of patients during his career, exaggerated or invented cancer risks and claimed payments for more expensive procedures in some cases.

Paterson, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was also found guilty of three counts of unlawful wounding.

The seven-week trial heard the accounts of 10 victims – representing a sample of those Paterson treated – operated on at the privately run Little Aston and Parkway hospitals in the West Midlands.

Doughty said the case demonstrated the need for an independent inquiry into the private health sector, adding that there was far too little official scrutiny of such practices.

“There should be an independent inquiry, certainly in relation to the private sector. There should be much more regulation regarding the intertwining of the NHS and the private sector. We’re doing all we can with the civil proceedings to find out what happened, but there’s a limit to what the civil case can do to ensure safeguards are put in place.”

A review of the Heart of England NHS trust, which covers the West Midlands, revealed that a senior clinician raised concerns about Paterson’s mastectomies in 2004, meaning that there was a seven-year delay in stopping him operating on women with breast cancer.

Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who looked into the case, said, if the concerns had been acted on then, a “proper analysis of Paterson’s performance would have been instituted”.

Kennedy added: “It is very likely that the result would have been that Paterson would have been required to stop operating on women with breast cancer by the end of 2004 at the latest.”

Doughty said: “It’s clear that we need much more regulation in the private sector. The Kennedy review for the NHS was very thorough, but we’ve not had the same in the private sector yet.”

Jurors were not told Paterson carried out hundreds of unnecessary operations on NHS patients, with a hospital trust paying out £17.8m in damages and legal costs. He was granted bail and is due to be sentenced in May.",guardian.com,False

Blackman was freed from prison after serving half of the seven-year term imposed for manslaughter and was whisked away to a luxury country hideaway arranged by the Daily Mail, which backed his legal fight.



He told the tabloid: “Being out of prison is an immense feeling but I am very conscious that my sentence is not complete. I have been released on licence and there are certain conditions which I must – and will – respect.

In a tent deep in the woods of rural Kentucky, an old neo-Nazi spoke bitterly of how he feels “betrayed” by Donald Trump.

“I’m sorry I voted for the son of a bitch, I really am,” said Art Jones, who the Anti-Defamation League identifies as a Holocaust denier who has been dressing in Nazi garb and celebrating Hitler since the 1970s.

“I’m sorry I spent $180 out of my own pocket to buy three big banners that said, ‘President Trump, build the wall’,” the blazer-clad Jones said, to a tent full of about 100 men, some of whom wore paramilitary-style uniforms. “Now he says, ‘Eh, what wall?’ I’m embarrassed that I voted for him.”

Jones blamed Trump’s failures on the “Jewish lobby” and the president’s son-in-law and aide, Jared Kushner, who is Jewish.

“If I could take the vote back,” he said. “I would.”

On Friday night, on a barren stretch of private property accessible only by a dirt road, black-clad young men with rifles roamed. Others wore a handgun or knife at the hip. Members of at least 10 racist hate groups had met to discuss how they could become more politically relevant. They were also there to prepare for an anticipated battle with self-identified anti-fascist or “antifa” groups on Saturday – the 100th day of the Trump presidency – in the streets of the tiny town of Pikeville.

Pike County is 98% white; about 80% of voters there supported Trump. In choosing Pikeville for their rally, the neo-Nazis sought to attract white working families and build a more mainstream political movement, they said. Local residents and store managers said they were were furious, scared and resentful of the gathering.

Far-left and far-right groups that have clashed recently in Berkeley, Seattle and elsewhere. In Seattle, a protester was shot in the stomach. A rally last summer in Sacramento, staged by one of the groups organizing the Pikeville protest, left multiple people stabbed. Those standoffs were held in states with relatively strict gun laws. In Kentucky, which allows open carry, both the neo-Nazis and their opponents publicly discussed carrying guns at Saturday’s protest.



In an interview last week, Matthew Heimbach, the leader of the Traditionalist Worker Party, said the groups staging the rally would come with armed security officials, who would carry AR-15 rifles and wear body armor.

James Anderson, an editor at Itsgoingdown.org, an anarchist site, said the counter-protesters were sensitive to the potential impact on Pikeville locals.

“The organizers in Pikeville have been very clear they don’t want people coming to the small town and smashing up the one McDonald’s,” he said on Thursday.

In an email, one of the anonymous organizers of the “anti-fascist” protest wrote: “We have made sure to clearly communicate with folks from outside the region that this is not Berkley or a major city and tactics that are used there are not appropriate in eastern KY.”

The organizer wrote that the “antifas” were aware that clashing with neo-Nazis gave such groups more media attention. A town official said more than a dozen media outlets had come to Pikeville in advance of the protest.

“There is no denying they relish the attention,” the organizer wrote. “We also have to weigh the risks of not confronting them. We believe that, in the longer term, allowing neo-Nazis to organize openly and treating them like any other group gives them more legitimacy.

“History teaches us that ignoring Nazis will not make them go away and creates the risk they will begin to build real power.”

The standoff has attracted other heavily armed groups, including members of a militia group called the “III percenters”, classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as anti-government extremists.



“We want to make sure that the people of Pike County don’t get you know caught up in any violence,” said Chris Hall, the leader of the national umbrella group for the III percenters, which is sending some local groups to the protest. “We want to help prevent damage to property.

“We have no dog in that fight. Both are equally violent in my opinion.”

The commander of the Indiana III percenters, who declined to give his name, said he expected at least 60 members to attend in “full battle rattle”, with “our helmets full body armor, 9 thirty-round magazines and an AR-15”. He said he expected at least four other III percenter groups to attend.

The promise of confrontation between multiple armed groups in the narrow, alley-like streets of Pikeville left officials and residents nervous. The town government passed an anti-masking ordinance, barring masks, hoods and facial coverings in public places.

Several downtown business managers said they had decided to stayed closed at least until after the protest was over, and some said they were preparing to guard their buildings. Wes Hutcison, the manager of Bank 253, a local bar and restaurant, said he was worried “what it’s going to look like Sunday after everybody’s gone”.



Outside a tattoo shop, a man who said he was a veteran expressed anger that the Nazi rally was “setting back Pikeville 100 years”.

A peaceful counter-protest planned by local students was cancelled. The organizers wrote on Facebook on Thursday that after consulting with officials and law enforcement, “real and previously unforeseen credible threats to the safety of our attendees” had convinced them to cancel their “Rally for Equality and American Values”, which was slated to feature speeches from state politicians and a Holocaust survivor, as well as music.

‘These are our guests in our community’

While the broader region is suffering economically, Pikeville has grown. A brewery is being built and locals speak proudly of the hospital and university – and the ethnic diversity that doctors and students have brought.

The neo-Nazi rally was slated to start at 2pm in front of the historic courthouse. A leader of one of the extremist groups applied for a permit several months ago and were granted one, said Donovan Blackburn, Pikeville’s city manager.

“Our job is to uphold, protect and support first amendment rights,” he said. “What makes this country so great its the opportunity to voice your opinion vocally. Whether we agree with it or not is a moot issue.

“These are our guests in our community. We will treat them as such. When you go into someone’s home you need to show respect.”

In a public notice released on Friday, however, the town said it could not “guarantee the safety of everyone based upon tactics that have occurred in other areas”.

On Friday evening, the neo-Nazis assembled at a Walmart parking lot and formed a caravan of more than 20 cars to drive to the private land. Jeff Schoep, the leader of the National Socialist Movement, told participants they were “warriors for your people”.

“History and change is made through the streets,” he said, adding that if the rally became violent, participants should “stand united”. The group would not strike first, he said, but would defend itself.

To laughter, he added: “I’m telling you right now: if I see anybody running or breaking ranks, you better hope the reds catch you. You better hope the antifa catch you.”

There were at least five children present, including two girls who amused themselves by drawing as one speaker after another condemned the Jews and saluted white power.



“Do not use any foul language or any racial slurs,” Mike Schloer of the National Socialist Movement warned, reeling off a short list of epithets that should not be used in public.

Scientists are finalising plans to make a last-ditch attempt to save the world’s most endangered marine mammal, the vaquita porpoise. They believe there are now fewer than 30 of these distinctive cetaceans left in the Gulf of California.

Only by catching the remaining creatures and protecting them in a sanctuary can the vaquita be saved, it is argued.

Saved: the endangered species back from the brink of extinction Read more

The $4m (£3m) rescue plan will involve conservationists patrolling the gulf with the help of dolphins trained by the US navy to pinpoint other cetaceans. The idea is that the animals will then be captured and transported to a sanctuary in San Felipe, Mexico.

But the attempt carries risks. No one has every tried to capture, transport or care for a vaquita before and scientists do not know how they will react.

“Some porpoises, like the harbour porpoise, don’t seem to mind too much when captured, but others, such as the Dall’s porpoise, go into shock,” said Barbara Taylor, of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). “We don’t know which it is going to be. It is a nerve-racking prospect.”

However, scientists insist they now have no choice. “Vaquita numbers are so low it is clear that if we do nothing it will go extinct very soon,” said Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho, of Mexico’s National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change.

“However, if we capture the last few and try to protect them we have a chance to save the species.”

The vaquita, Phocoena sinus, is small, reaching a maximum length of only 5ft (1.5 metres), and has a grey back and white belly. Its home territory – a 900 sq mile section of the northern Gulf of California – is the smallest occupied by a whale species.

Twenty years ago, there were about 600 in the region. However, the population has since crashed as a result of illegal fishing of a species called the totoaba. Flesh from its swim bladder can fetch prices of more than $100,000 (£77,000) per kilogramme in China, where it is prized for its medicinal properties. “Quite simply, it commands a higher price than cocaine,” said Rojas-Bracho.

The gill nets designed to catch totoaba are also the perfect size for capturing vaquitas, which get tangled and drown. The Mexican government has recently tightened its laws against illegal fishing, but the rewards for totoaba catches are so high there has been little respite and vaquita numbers have continued to plummet.

“The population dropped to 30 last year, but there have been more deaths so I expect we’ll lose about half of this number this year,” said Taylor, a member of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita . “At this rate it will not last much longer. That is why our task is so urgent.”

As part of the rescue project – which has received $3m backing from the Mexican government and $1m from the US Association of Zoos and Aquariums – researchers will use acoustic sensors over the next few months to find the vaquitas and then, in October, they will try to catch individual specimens in nets.

“We plan to use a couple of trained dolphins to help us,” said Taylor. “It remains to be seen how effective they will be.”

Once the vaquitas are caught, they will be carried to floating pens and – if they respond to the ordeal in a relatively stress-free manner – they will be taken to a sanctuary being built in San Felipe.

“Ultimately, we would like to begin a captive breeding programme with the aim of restoring numbers and finally returning vaquitas to the wild, although we obviously cannot do that until we have dealt with the problems that are causing them to be wiped out at present,” said Taylor.

Ten years ago Taylor was involved in an attempt to survey numbers of a similar cetacean, the Yangtze river dolphin – also known as the baiji. Its population was known to be threatened by the illegal laying of fishing nets.

What Taylor’s team found turned out to be far worse. “We didn’t see a single baiji or hear one whistle,” she told the Observer. “We were too late.” The baiji is now officially listed as extinct.

“I resolved then that the vaquita would not suffer a similar fate,” Taylor said – although she accepts the recent dramatic decline in its numbers puts it in a very perilous position.

“It is always risky taking an animal into captivity, especially one with which we have no previous experience and who are made up of the last few individuals of that species. But we have to do this.”

In the past, other species have been pulled back from the brink of extinction, Rojas-Bracho said. Hunting had reduced numbers of the northern elephant seal to a few dozen in the 19th century.

Today, protected by law, there are more than 170,000 of them. “A similar story concerns the southern sea otter, which was reduced in number to about 50 but which has since bounced back to around 2,500 creatures,” he said. “This sort of thing can be done.

“Certainly, we are not where we would want to be when it comes to saving the vaquita – but we have to do our best or it will be lost to the planet for ever.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/fadwa-barghouti-interview-prison-hunger-strike,"Not long before Marwan Barghouti, the imprisoned leader of Fatah, called the largest hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners in recent years, his wife, Fadwa, and daughter Ruba visited him in Hadarim prison, Israel.

“The last time I went to visit him with my daughter was two to three months ago,” recalled Fadwa last week on the 11th day of the strike. “My daughter said to him, ‘I wish you wouldn’t do this. We don’t see you very often. My brothers don’t see you. We will worry about you and not be able to visit.’ He replied: ‘I know it’s going to be painful for the family’.”

Two weeks since it began, the strike by more than 1,000 prisoners in Israeli jails is galvanising Palestinian opinion. On Thursday, the day The Observer spoke to Fadwa in Ramallah, a general strike in support of the prisoners had shuttered shops, offices and schools. Roads were blocked by barricades and there were new posters in the city, depicting the prisoners.

The hunger strike is taking place against a background of rising tension before the 50th anniversary in June of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories, not just between Palestinians and Israelis, but between the main Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas.

At its centre is Barghouti, 57, who is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2004 by an Israeli court of five counts of murder for his role in directing attacks against Israelis during the second intifada, which took place between 2000 and 2005. As the strike began, he was moved from Hadarim into solitary confinement in a prison near Haifa.

Barghouti’s supporters insist the strike is about prisoner rights, not his political ambitions. But inevitably the question of how he is seen – and what he represents – has come to dominate.

In the rhetoric of right-wing Israeli ministers and commentators, Barghouti is a “murderer and terrorist” who some say should have been executed. To many Palestinians he is a hero, sometimes compared to Nelson Mandela, and a figure untainted by the corruption and political machinations that have been a hallmark of the era of the ageing Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.

In her office, hung with pictures of her husband, the strain is beginning to show on Fadwa. With little information from the Israeli prison service, and no access, what news she has comes from other prisoners who have seen her husband and managed to pass back a few details.

Some reports say the strike is already exacting a heavy toll on its participants, who are taking only water and salt, although none so far have suffered serious health problems. “The next days will be hard,” said Fadwa. “The last time I saw him was two weeks before the strike. Since the first day no one has been able visit him. All the information I have is unofficial. Some of the prisoners are suffering and it is getting worse.”

Palestinian hunger strikers' leader moved to solitary confinement Read more

Fadwa said the strikers drew up a list of demands eight months ago, about prison conditions, including visits, access to phones, education and health screening. “They sent letters to the Palestinian leadership saying if Israel did not comply by 16 April the strike would begin, telling the Palestinian Authority that they could help prevent it by putting pressure on the Israelis.”

Even if there have been contacts behind the scenes, it appears there has been no negotiation. Instead Israel has increased pressure on the strikers by cutting them off from the outside world. Supporters say radios have been confiscated and access to lawyers ended. Issa Qaraqe, head of prisoners affairs for the Palestinian Authority, said the leaders have been confined in solitary, and others have been moved to special wings. “They have set up collective confinement sections where hunger strikers have been put with only the clothes they are wearing, mattresses and toothpaste, with personal belongings confiscated.”

Of more concern to Qaraqe and Fadwa has been comments by some Israeli ministers, including the combative intelligence minister Israel Katz, who said Barghouti should have been executed. “When a despicable murderer like Barghouti protests in prison for improved conditions, while the relatives of those he murdered are still in pain, there is only one solution – death penalty for terrorists,” said Katz at the beginning of the protest.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Barghouti as an “arch-terrorist” while the defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, suggested Israel should take the approach of Margaret Thatcher towards the IRA hunger strikers in 1981 and allow them to die.

Describing the Israeli response as “incitement and provocation”, Qaraqe said: “These statements – accompanied by the extreme measures against the hunger strikers – aggravate the situation. This strike did not come out of a vacuum. It came out of the failure to discuss the issues with the Israeli prison authorities … Israel brought the situation to this level.” Beyond the prison walls, the scale of the strike has created problems for all sides. Israeli authorities have previously negotiated with hunger strikers, and their intransigent language has raised tensions. And while senior Palestinian figures, including Abbas, offer vocal support, the timing of the strike – before next week’s meeting between Abbas and Donald Trump in Washington – is clearly troubling them. The result is a complicated balancing act for the Palestinian leadership – lending support while instructing their security services to prevent clashes with Israelis at checkpoints during demonstrations supporting the strike. This underscores the view that Barghouti has limited control of the situation.

Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel go on hunger strike Read more

That he should be at the forefront, even in prison, is hardly surprising to long-time observers. Speaking to this writer three years ago, former Israeli peace negotiator Yossi Beilin, who knew Barghouti, presciently flagged up the challenge that he posed. Inside or outside jail, Barghouti remains one of the most important Palestinian leaders. “I am not an admirer,” Beilin said then. “He is shrewd. A street cat. He is a proud Palestinian, proud of his movement. I saw him [during the Oslo peace talks] as a partner. Someone committed to a political solution.

“He is a politician and a statesman. Like other politicians who have been involved with violence, we have somehow to find a way of dealing with him in a political framework … because he can lead those who follow him to an agreement.”

That “shrewdness” is evident in the hunger strike, and not only its timing ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Israeli occupation. The demands for better prisoner conditions, low key as they are, seem designed to be – in theory at least – achievable.

The question now is whether Barghouti’s well-attested influence and charisma is such that he can lead, even sequestered in solitary confinement.

For Israel, if the protest continues, the choices do not appear good, with security officials aware that dead hunger strikers would risk an upsurge in violence. Force-feeding too, although permitted in Israel following a supreme court ruling last year, is also deeply contentious, with the Israeli Medical Association opposed.

In her office, Fadwa is suddenly tearful, contemplating where the hunger strike will lead: “An element that makes it harder is that I feel other families want to draw strength from me, so I need to hide my feelings,” she said, adding that the strike had made her realise how much her husband had been absent from his family – in prison, wanted, or deported. “I used to blame Marwan for not being there. He said you have to bear with me. It is the struggle for a better life for our children. Now it has been 30 years.”

It is also clear that the absence of any dialogue does not bode well for the health of the strikers. Asked about the risks, she says only: “God will protect him.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/ja-rule-heartbroken-after-fyre-festival-descends-into-disaster,"Rapper says event, which has been likened to Lord of the Flies, was ‘not a scam’ as co-organiser admits he was ‘a little naive’

The organisers of a luxury music festival in the Bahamas have apologised after the event descended into chaos, drawing comparisons to The Hunger Games and The Lord of The Flies.

Fyre Festival, on the private Great Exumas island, had been billed as a “cultural moment” for monied millennials, with tickets costing up to $12,780 for a four-person package. It was heavily promoted on Instagram as an opportunity to mingle with models and “influencers”, including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski.

The event was due to feature performances from Blink-182, Skepta and Rae Sremmurd, and run over two weekends from 28 April. One of the organisers, rapper Ja Rule, reportedly toasted during a site visit: “To living like movie stars, partying like rock stars, and fucking like porn stars.”

But after headliners Blink-182 pulled out on Friday citing poor infrastructure, ticket holders arrived on Great Exumas island to chaotic scenes.

Posts to social media drew comparisons to a refugee camp, with “disaster relief tents” being used as cabanas in expanses of mud, mountains of rubbish, and low-quality sandwiches.

Patrons were left stranded on the island, with #fyrefestival trending on Twitter as they begged to be evacuated and others delighted in schadenfreude.

In a statement, organisers cited “circumstances out of our control” for their inability to prepare the “physical infrastructure” for the event in the largely undeveloped private island.



They were working to arrange charter flights to Miami for people already on Exumas while inbound flights had been cancelled.

The Bahamas ministry of tourism released a statement on Twitter, expressing disappointment that “hundreds of visitors to Exuma were met with total disorganisation and chaos”.

Though the ministry was not an official sponsor of Fyre Festival, it said it had offered advice and support to the organisers, who had assured them it was in hand. “But clearly they did not have the capacity to execute an event of this scale,” the ministry said.

A team of ministry representatives were on the island to assist with the safe return of all visitors.

Ja Rule wrote on Twitter that he was “heartbroken” by the way the event unfolded and that it was “NOT A SCAM”: “I don’t know how everything went so left but I’m working to make it right.”

A talent producer hired to work on the festival suggested that it was beset by problems from the outset.



“When we arrived, my initial reaction was ‘huh’,” wrote Chloe Gordon in New York Magazine. “This was not a model-filled private cay that was owned by Pablo Escobar. This was a development lot covered in gravel with a few tractors scattered around.”

“We were standing on an empty gravel pit and no one had any idea how we were going to build a festival village from scratch.”

Ja Rule’s partner, co-organiser Billy McFarland, told Rolling Stone that Friday was “the toughest day of my life”. He admitted being overly “ambitious”.

“We were a little naïve in thinking for the first time we could do this ourselves. Next year, we will definitely start earlier.”

There would be another event, held in the US in May, free for ticketholders that would “keep the theme of being on water and beach” and be “not just music, but all forms of entertainment”. He clarified that “we will not try to do it ourselves”.",guardian.com,False

Pope Francis has said a third country should mediate the dispute between North Korea and the US, which he said had become “too hot”, risking a war in which “a good part of humanity” would be destroyed.

Donald Trump, meanwhile, answered a question in a television interview about whether military action was possible by saying: “I don’t know. I mean, we’ll see.”

The pope, speaking to reporters aboard the plane taking him back to Rome from Cairo, also said he was ready to meet Trump in Europe next month. He added, however, that he was not aware of any request for a meeting.

In answer to a question about North Korean missile tests and military and diplomatic moves by the US, Francis said the United Nations should re-assert its leadership because it had become “too watered down”.

“I call on … all leaders … to work to seek a solution to problems through the path of diplomacy,” he said.

North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile on Friday, shortly after secretary of state Rex Tillerson warned that failure to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes could lead to “catastrophic consequences”.

The test failed. Trump, who earlier this week said the US could have a “major, major conflict” with North Korea, responded with a tweet. The president wrote: “North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected president when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!”

In remarks released by CBS ahead of an interview set to be broadcast on Sunday and Monday and part-taped at Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, the president was asked if diplomatic and military pressure was working.

“Well, I didn’t say, “don’t test a missile’,” Trump said. “[North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is] going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we’re not going to be very happy.”

Trump said president Xi Jinping of China, “a man that I’ve gotten to like and respect” and whom he met earlier this month in Florida, was also pressuring North Korea.



“But so far,” he continued, “perhaps nothing’s happened and perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We’ll see what happens.”

Trump added: “If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy. And I can tell you also, I don’t believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.”

Would that mean military action?

“I don’t know,” said Trump. “I mean, we’ll see.”

On the papal plane, Francis gave a news conference that lasted around 30 minutes. He said: “There are so many facilitators in the world, there are mediators who offer themselves, such as Norway for example. It [Norway] is always ready to help. That is just one but there are many. But the path is the path of negotiations, of a diplomatic solution.

“This question of missiles in [North] Korea has been brewing for more than a year but now it seems the situation has become has become too hot.

“We are talking about the future of humanity. Today, a widespread war would destroy – I would not say half of humanity – but a good part of humanity, and of culture, everything, everything. It would be terrible. I don’t think that humanity today would be able to withstand it.”

Trump is due in Sicily on 26 and 27 May for a meeting of the heads of the world’s richest nations. The White House has not yet said if he will stop in Rome to meet the pope, which would be an unusual omission for a visiting head of state.

Asked if he would meet Trump, the pope said: “I receive every head of state who asks for an audience.”",guardian.com,False

A hacker who claimed to have stolen the forthcoming season of Netflix’s hit series Orange is the New Black and demanded a ransom payment claimed on Saturday to have followed through on its threat to release several episodes online.

Orange is the New Black season four review – criminally close to greatness Read more

The hacker, operating under the name The Dark Overlord, initially demanded that Netflix pay an unspecified ransom to prevent all the new episodes from being prematurely released online.



The hacker had already purportedly uploaded the first episode to an illegal file-sharing service. The authenticity of that uploaded file could not be legally confirmed.

Early on Saturday, the hacker announced the move to release the episodes on Twitter. The post included a link to an illegal file-sharing service where purportedly 10 episodes from the series’ fifth season were available for download. The authenticity of those files could not be legally confirmed.

New episodes of the series are scheduled for official release on 9 June. Netflix did not immediately return a call seeking comment on the apparent release of 10 episodes.

Earlier, it said that a small production vendor that works with several major TV studios had suffered a breach. The company, based in Los Gatos, California, described the breach as an “active situation” that was being investigated by the FBI and other authorities.



Pirated copies of the show could dent Netflix’s subscriber growth and the company’s stock price.

In the ransom note, The Dark Overlord claimed to have stolen series from other studios by breaking into a single company. The purported hacker promised to also release those titles unless “modest” ransoms were paid.

Rumours of a massive leak of Hollywood films and TV episodes have been circulating online for months, fed by purported screenshots of footage and a copy of a proposed deal to delete the stolen material in return for tens of thousands of dollars in electronic currency.

When the Associated Press contacted The Dark Overlord in February, the hacker said the stolen video would not be made publicly available after all, making the far-fetched claim that “no one really [cares] about unreleased movies and TV show episodes.”

It is not clear what triggered The Dark Overlord’s renewed ransom demands or apparent decision to release the episodes of Orange is the New Black.

Netflix is counting onthe prison drama to help it add 3.2 million subscribers from April through June, a figure substantially higher than the company’s average gain of 1.8 million subscribers in the same period over the past five years.

An American woman who was arrested on a business trip in China and later convicted of spying has been deported to the US.

Jeff Gillis said his wife, Phan “Sandy” Phan-Gillis, got on a flight to Los Angeles from the southern city of Guangzhou on Friday evening. The couple planned to stay in LA a few days to visit relatives before returning to their Houston home, he said.

American woman held in China since March is no spy, husband says Read more

Phan-Gillis, a US citizen of Chinese descent, had faced an uncertain fate since March 2015, when she disappeared from a group traveling in southern China when about to leave the mainland for the Chinese-ruled, former Portuguese colony of Macau. She was later accused of espionage.

On Tuesday, after being held without trial for two years, Phan-Gillis was sentenced by Chinese authorities to three years in prison. The sentence was seen as an indication that she soon could be allowed to return home.

Her lawyer told Reuters on Tuesday he could not reveal details of the case because it involved “state secrets”.

Jeff Gillis, said China had accused Phan-Gillis of visiting the country twice on spy missions in 1996 and working with the FBI to capture two Chinese spies in the US and turn them into double agents.

The deportation comes at a time of warming China-US relations after Donald Trump met Chinese president Xi Jinping in Florida in early April.

In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Trump called Xi a “good man” and praised him for his efforts to press North Korea to give up its development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.

An official of the US state department said it was aware of the deportation.

“The United States welcomes her home,” said the official, who did not want to be identified by name.

Negotiations to secure the release of Phan-Gillis intensified when secretary of state Rex Tillerson visited Beijing in March, according to the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation.

“Sandy is overjoyed to be reunited with friends and family, and sends out her thanks to the many people who worked tirelessly for her release,” Gillis said.",guardian.com,False

Of more concern to Qaraqe and Fadwa has been comments by some Israeli ministers, including the combative intelligence minister Israel Katz, who said Barghouti should have been executed. “When a despicable murderer like Barghouti protests in prison for improved conditions, while the relatives of those he murdered are still in pain, there is only one solution – death penalty for terrorists,” said Katz at the beginning of the protest.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Barghouti as an “arch-terrorist” while the defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, suggested Israel should take the approach of Margaret Thatcher towards the IRA hunger strikers in 1981 and allow them to die.

Describing the Israeli response as “incitement and provocation”, Qaraqe said: “These statements – accompanied by the extreme measures against the hunger strikers – aggravate the situation. This strike did not come out of a vacuum. It came out of the failure to discuss the issues with the Israeli prison authorities … Israel brought the situation to this level.” Beyond the prison walls, the scale of the strike has created problems for all sides. Israeli authorities have previously negotiated with hunger strikers, and their intransigent language has raised tensions. And while senior Palestinian figures, including Abbas, offer vocal support, the timing of the strike – before next week’s meeting between Abbas and Donald Trump in Washington – is clearly troubling them. The result is a complicated balancing act for the Palestinian leadership – lending support while instructing their security services to prevent clashes with Israelis at checkpoints during demonstrations supporting the strike. This underscores the view that Barghouti has limited control of the situation.

That he should be at the forefront, even in prison, is hardly surprising to long-time observers. Speaking to this writer three years ago, former Israeli peace negotiator Yossi Beilin, who knew Barghouti, presciently flagged up the challenge that he posed. Inside or outside jail, Barghouti remains one of the most important Palestinian leaders. “I am not an admirer,” Beilin said then. “He is shrewd. A street cat. He is a proud Palestinian, proud of his movement. I saw him [during the Oslo peace talks] as a partner. Someone committed to a political solution.

“He is a politician and a statesman. Like other politicians who have been involved with violence, we have somehow to find a way of dealing with him in a political framework … because he can lead those who follow him to an agreement.”

That “shrewdness” is evident in the hunger strike, and not only its timing ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Israeli occupation. The demands for better prisoner conditions, low key as they are, seem designed to be – in theory at least – achievable.

The question now is whether Barghouti’s well-attested influence and charisma is such that he can lead, even sequestered in solitary confinement.

For Israel, if the protest continues, the choices do not appear good, with security officials aware that dead hunger strikers would risk an upsurge in violence. Force-feeding too, although permitted in Israel following a supreme court ruling last year, is also deeply contentious, with the Israeli Medical Association opposed.

In her office, Fadwa is suddenly tearful, contemplating where the hunger strike will lead: “An element that makes it harder is that I feel other families want to draw strength from me, so I need to hide my feelings,” she said, adding that the strike had made her realise how much her husband had been absent from his family – in prison, wanted, or deported. “I used to blame Marwan for not being there. He said you have to bear with me. It is the struggle for a better life for our children. Now it has been 30 years.”

It is also clear that the absence of any dialogue does not bode well for the health of the strikers. Asked about the risks, she says only: “God will protect him.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/ja-rule-heartbroken-after-fyre-festival-descends-into-disaster,"Rapper says event, which has been likened to Lord of the Flies, was ‘not a scam’ as co-organiser admits he was ‘a little naive’

The organisers of a luxury music festival in the Bahamas have apologised after the event descended into chaos, drawing comparisons to The Hunger Games and The Lord of The Flies.

Fyre Festival, on the private Great Exumas island, had been billed as a “cultural moment” for monied millennials, with tickets costing up to $12,780 for a four-person package. It was heavily promoted on Instagram as an opportunity to mingle with models and “influencers”, including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski.

The event was due to feature performances from Blink-182, Skepta and Rae Sremmurd, and run over two weekends from 28 April. One of the organisers, rapper Ja Rule, reportedly toasted during a site visit: “To living like movie stars, partying like rock stars, and fucking like porn stars.”

But after headliners Blink-182 pulled out on Friday citing poor infrastructure, ticket holders arrived on Great Exumas island to chaotic scenes.

Posts to social media drew comparisons to a refugee camp, with “disaster relief tents” being used as cabanas in expanses of mud, mountains of rubbish, and low-quality sandwiches.

Patrons were left stranded on the island, with #fyrefestival trending on Twitter as they begged to be evacuated and others delighted in schadenfreude.

In a statement, organisers cited “circumstances out of our control” for their inability to prepare the “physical infrastructure” for the event in the largely undeveloped private island.



They were working to arrange charter flights to Miami for people already on Exumas while inbound flights had been cancelled.

The Bahamas ministry of tourism released a statement on Twitter, expressing disappointment that “hundreds of visitors to Exuma were met with total disorganisation and chaos”.

Though the ministry was not an official sponsor of Fyre Festival, it said it had offered advice and support to the organisers, who had assured them it was in hand. “But clearly they did not have the capacity to execute an event of this scale,” the ministry said.

A team of ministry representatives were on the island to assist with the safe return of all visitors.

Ja Rule wrote on Twitter that he was “heartbroken” by the way the event unfolded and that it was “NOT A SCAM”: “I don’t know how everything went so left but I’m working to make it right.”

A talent producer hired to work on the festival suggested that it was beset by problems from the outset.



“When we arrived, my initial reaction was ‘huh’,” wrote Chloe Gordon in New York Magazine. “This was not a model-filled private cay that was owned by Pablo Escobar. This was a development lot covered in gravel with a few tractors scattered around.”

“We were standing on an empty gravel pit and no one had any idea how we were going to build a festival village from scratch.”

Ja Rule’s partner, co-organiser Billy McFarland, told Rolling Stone that Friday was “the toughest day of my life”. He admitted being overly “ambitious”.

“We were a little naïve in thinking for the first time we could do this ourselves. Next year, we will definitely start earlier.”

There would be another event, held in the US in May, free for ticketholders that would “keep the theme of being on water and beach” and be “not just music, but all forms of entertainment”. He clarified that “we will not try to do it ourselves”.",guardian.com,False

Pope Francis has said a third country should mediate the dispute between North Korea and the US, which he said had become “too hot”, risking a war in which “a good part of humanity” would be destroyed.

Donald Trump, meanwhile, answered a question in a television interview about whether military action was possible by saying: “I don’t know. I mean, we’ll see.”

The pope, speaking to reporters aboard the plane taking him back to Rome from Cairo, also said he was ready to meet Trump in Europe next month. He added, however, that he was not aware of any request for a meeting.

In answer to a question about North Korean missile tests and military and diplomatic moves by the US, Francis said the United Nations should re-assert its leadership because it had become “too watered down”.

“I call on … all leaders … to work to seek a solution to problems through the path of diplomacy,” he said.

North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile on Friday, shortly after secretary of state Rex Tillerson warned that failure to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes could lead to “catastrophic consequences”.

The test failed. Trump, who earlier this week said the US could have a “major, major conflict” with North Korea, responded with a tweet. The president wrote: “North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected president when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!”

In remarks released by CBS ahead of an interview set to be broadcast on Sunday and Monday and part-taped at Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, the president was asked if diplomatic and military pressure was working.

“Well, I didn’t say, “don’t test a missile’,” Trump said. “[North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is] going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we’re not going to be very happy.”

Trump said president Xi Jinping of China, “a man that I’ve gotten to like and respect” and whom he met earlier this month in Florida, was also pressuring North Korea.



“But so far,” he continued, “perhaps nothing’s happened and perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We’ll see what happens.”

Trump added: “If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy. And I can tell you also, I don’t believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.”

Would that mean military action?

“I don’t know,” said Trump. “I mean, we’ll see.”

On the papal plane, Francis gave a news conference that lasted around 30 minutes. He said: “There are so many facilitators in the world, there are mediators who offer themselves, such as Norway for example. It [Norway] is always ready to help. That is just one but there are many. But the path is the path of negotiations, of a diplomatic solution.

“This question of missiles in [North] Korea has been brewing for more than a year but now it seems the situation has become has become too hot.

“We are talking about the future of humanity. Today, a widespread war would destroy – I would not say half of humanity – but a good part of humanity, and of culture, everything, everything. It would be terrible. I don’t think that humanity today would be able to withstand it.”

Trump is due in Sicily on 26 and 27 May for a meeting of the heads of the world’s richest nations. The White House has not yet said if he will stop in Rome to meet the pope, which would be an unusual omission for a visiting head of state.

Asked if he would meet Trump, the pope said: “I receive every head of state who asks for an audience.”",guardian.com,False

A hacker who claimed to have stolen the forthcoming season of Netflix’s hit series Orange is the New Black and demanded a ransom payment claimed on Saturday to have followed through on its threat to release several episodes online.

Orange is the New Black season four review – criminally close to greatness Read more

The hacker, operating under the name The Dark Overlord, initially demanded that Netflix pay an unspecified ransom to prevent all the new episodes from being prematurely released online.



The hacker had already purportedly uploaded the first episode to an illegal file-sharing service. The authenticity of that uploaded file could not be legally confirmed.

Early on Saturday, the hacker announced the move to release the episodes on Twitter. The post included a link to an illegal file-sharing service where purportedly 10 episodes from the series’ fifth season were available for download. The authenticity of those files could not be legally confirmed.

New episodes of the series are scheduled for official release on 9 June. Netflix did not immediately return a call seeking comment on the apparent release of 10 episodes.

Earlier, it said that a small production vendor that works with several major TV studios had suffered a breach. The company, based in Los Gatos, California, described the breach as an “active situation” that was being investigated by the FBI and other authorities.



Pirated copies of the show could dent Netflix’s subscriber growth and the company’s stock price.

In the ransom note, The Dark Overlord claimed to have stolen series from other studios by breaking into a single company. The purported hacker promised to also release those titles unless “modest” ransoms were paid.

Rumours of a massive leak of Hollywood films and TV episodes have been circulating online for months, fed by purported screenshots of footage and a copy of a proposed deal to delete the stolen material in return for tens of thousands of dollars in electronic currency.

When the Associated Press contacted The Dark Overlord in February, the hacker said the stolen video would not be made publicly available after all, making the far-fetched claim that “no one really [cares] about unreleased movies and TV show episodes.”

It is not clear what triggered The Dark Overlord’s renewed ransom demands or apparent decision to release the episodes of Orange is the New Black.

Netflix is counting onthe prison drama to help it add 3.2 million subscribers from April through June, a figure substantially higher than the company’s average gain of 1.8 million subscribers in the same period over the past five years.

An American woman who was arrested on a business trip in China and later convicted of spying has been deported to the US.

Jeff Gillis said his wife, Phan “Sandy” Phan-Gillis, got on a flight to Los Angeles from the southern city of Guangzhou on Friday evening. The couple planned to stay in LA a few days to visit relatives before returning to their Houston home, he said.

American woman held in China since March is no spy, husband says Read more

Phan-Gillis, a US citizen of Chinese descent, had faced an uncertain fate since March 2015, when she disappeared from a group traveling in southern China when about to leave the mainland for the Chinese-ruled, former Portuguese colony of Macau. She was later accused of espionage.

On Tuesday, after being held without trial for two years, Phan-Gillis was sentenced by Chinese authorities to three years in prison. The sentence was seen as an indication that she soon could be allowed to return home.

Her lawyer told Reuters on Tuesday he could not reveal details of the case because it involved “state secrets”.

Jeff Gillis, said China had accused Phan-Gillis of visiting the country twice on spy missions in 1996 and working with the FBI to capture two Chinese spies in the US and turn them into double agents.

The deportation comes at a time of warming China-US relations after Donald Trump met Chinese president Xi Jinping in Florida in early April.

In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Trump called Xi a “good man” and praised him for his efforts to press North Korea to give up its development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.

An official of the US state department said it was aware of the deportation.

“The United States welcomes her home,” said the official, who did not want to be identified by name.

Negotiations to secure the release of Phan-Gillis intensified when secretary of state Rex Tillerson visited Beijing in March, according to the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation.

“Sandy is overjoyed to be reunited with friends and family, and sends out her thanks to the many people who worked tirelessly for her release,” Gillis said.",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/apr/29/schools-parents-pupils-education-teachers,"When Geoff Barton started teaching in 1985, parents’ evening – a brief five-minute chat – was the only time teachers saw most mums and dads. If families had a concern, they might write a letter, or call the school office.

Fast-forward three decades and the dynamics between schools and parents have changed dramatically. The voice of parents is louder, their expectations higher – and it’s much easier to instantly broadcast a complaint.

Research by academics at Bath Spa University suggests that in some cases the often delicate relationship between parents and teachers has shifted even further. Abusive behaviour by parents is experienced by a third of primary teachers, either online or on the school premises, at least once a month. A fifth of secondary school teachers are exposed to such behaviour once a month, according to the study. Female teachers were more likely to report such experiences.

Sometimes there isn’t a detachment for parents or the school between what has happened and has been alleged Geoff Barton

“In the past, there wasn’t the same forensic focus on schools and school performance,” says Barton, a veteran headteacher who was elected general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders in February. “And, today, communication is so much quicker – access to teachers through email is so much quicker. That sometimes means there isn’t a detachment for parents or the school between what has happened and has been alleged.”

Barton, who was headteacher of King Edward VI school in Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk for 15 years, says teachers want parents to be engaged, but that some schools are still getting to grips with how to manage this relationship. Some are handing out guidelines warning families about defamatory comments online, or issuing a template complaint letter to parents to prevent angry email tirades. Others display a poster in their reception areas, outlining how the school expects parents to behave, and how families will be treated in return.

Jermaine Ravalier, senior lecturer in psychology at Bath Spa University and one of the authors of the research, says abusive behaviour often results in stress and sickness absence. “It can lead to impact on physical health as well as mental health, things like having panic attacks. If a teacher is stressed then undoubtedly it also has an impact on the class’s learning.”

But closer parental scrutiny of schools and higher parental expectations do not always lead to a negative outcome, says Barton. Previous generations of parents often saw their role as secondary. “They’d send their child to school and at the end of school their child came out and they have a qualification, either a good one or a bad one depending on whether the child had worked hard or not. There was a bit more detachment generally. That’s not to say we didn’t hear from parents, but if we did, usually you would get a letter from them and usually you’d phone them up at the end of the day.”

Teachers weren’t expected to respond instantly, and parents didn’t generally turn up in reception asking to see a teacher. Now some parents are a lot more comfortable complaining to higher powers as a first point of contact, or posting on Facebook.

Yet parents are getting a huge amount more from schools than they did even 10 years ago, says Barton. “Many will be reporting on a child’s progress every six weeks so they’ll get a progress report in every subject, from every teacher at the end of every half-term. At some schools they can check attendance every day. That’s an extraordinary level of accountability and openness of information.”

Tania Tirraoro, founder of Special Needs Jungle, a website that gives advice to parents who have children with special educational needs, agrees that parents are more empowered than ever before and sees that as a positive development. “When we were kids the school was always right, but nowadays, especially with the information you can find on the internet, people are more willing to stand up for their children to make sure they get what they need.”

Most of the traffic to Special Needs Jungle comes through Facebook, where groups of parents share their experiences about navigating the system. But the idea of parents discussing a school’s policy or announcements on social media, and the threat of posts going viral or getting picked up by the press, is a worry for headteachers.

Handling difficult parents is a grey area. There aren’t any government policies 'Anne', teacher

Anne (not her real name), a teacher in Devon who was signed off sick after five months of being bullied by a parent, said some schools were reluctant to stand up to parents. “With social media, parental voice is unbelievably loud and I’m not sure schools know how to react. There’s a fear that parents could threaten to write to Ofsted, to write to the papers, to just put something on social media – and if it goes viral that puts the school in a really vulnerable place. Handling difficult parents is a grey area. There aren’t any government policies.”

Anne and her colleagues were targeted by a parent who would demand to speak to her on an almost daily basis, and made allegations about a staff member’s character. The parent also followed staff outside the school premises and attempted to stir up support among other parents at the school gate.

For younger teachers, the consequences of such harassment can be devastating. “It got to a stage where myself and the other members of my team were in a state of anxiety. There was that lingering threat of, ‘Who is she going to start on next?’ For me at the beginning of my career, I thought, could she end my career? She could spread malicious gossip and it could be completely unfounded.”

Given the additional pressures that staff face, it’s not surprising that almost a third of teachers leave the state sector within five years of qualifying, she says.

Research by the National Foundation for Educational Research revealed the retention rate among secondary heads fell from 91% in 2012 to 87% in 2015. Barton said the figures were a concern, and that the ASCL plans to ensure younger heads are given more support by older colleagues. “One of the things I’m keen to do is to make sure those of us who are the veterans of the system are passing on the knowledge and skills but also the sense of resilience and how you withstand a sense of, ‘Is this personal?’ and how you develop a thicker skin.”

Vic Goddard, headteacher of Passmores academy in Harlow, which was profiled in the Channel 4 series Educating Essex, said parents are entitled to criticise schools. “As part of parents’ induction to school we give them a suggested paragraph to write in emails, so that if their child comes home and says, ‘Mr Goddard did this and this today’ they can approach it in a particular way.”

Most disputes can be quickly solved if schools have a clear policy that allows time for parents to cool off. Russell Hobby, head of the National Association of Headteachers, said it was not just teaching staff who were being challenged by the public. “We live in a society that is just less deferent of professional expertise. We find people challenge [experts] more and that’s good in many ways – I don’t want to live in a deferent society, but one of the things about schools is it’s not a customer service, it’s not a popularity contest. If you run a school you may have to make unpopular decisions.”

HARD TIMES

A third of primary school teachers experienced derogatory words or behaviour from parents either online or on school premises at least once a month.

Among secondary school teachers, one in five experienced derogatory behaviour once a month. This was mostly on school premises – only 4% of such behaviour occurred online.

Female teachers are more likely than male ones to experience abusive behaviour on school premises. Half reported they encountered this several times a year or more, compared with 40% of male teachers.

A fifth of teaching assistants were exposed to negative words or behaviour either online (5%) or on school premises (16%) at least once a month.

A third of new teachers who started jobs in English state schools in 2010 left within five years.

Acceptances to teacher training courses dropped by 7% this year. The government has missed its targets for teacher recruitment in England for five consecutive years.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/29/ms-13-terrifies-long-islands-latinos-and-prompts-a-political-backlash-from-trump,"The town of Central Islip is confronting both the brutal Salvadorean street gang and the fear of sweeping community deportations after a crackdown

The first victims were high school friends Nisa Mickens, 15, and Kayla Cuevas, 16 – killed as they were out on an evening walk last September. A week later, the bodies of Oscar Acosta and Miguel Garcia-Moran, both 19 and missing since the start of the year, were found near an abandoned hospital. Then, this month, four teenage boys were killed close by in a park in Central Islip, a predominantly Latino town on New York’s Long Island, 40 miles east of Manhattan.

In that incident, the killers used machetes or other sharp instruments, their grotesque handiwork betraying the cruelty and ritualism of MS-13, or the Mara Salvatrucha, a neighbourhood street gang with its roots in El Salvador’s civil war of the 80s and 90s.

While no arrests have been made in the most recent murders, police said the victims – Jorge Tigre, 18, Justin Llivicura, 16, Michael Banegas, 18, and Jefferson Villalobos, 18 – were killed in a manner “consistent with the modus operandi” of MS-13.

Now the gang’s trademark brutality and terrifying, heavily tattooed countenances have attracted the attention of US political and law enforcement leadership. On Friday, at Central Islip’s vast federal courthouse, which rises like a white edifice in scrubby woodland five miles from where the murders took place, President Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, restated his commitment to helping the police battle street gangs.

He said the killings were an assault on law and safety, vowed to not let this continue, and blamed “bad guys [that] know how the system works, and they have exploited it”.

Coming on the 100-day mark of the new presidency, Sessions’s comments sought to give flesh and bone to the “bad hombres” of Trump campaign folklore. They could hardly have found a more ferocious-looking group of young men upon which to fix their fear of the outsider.

Indeed, senior administration officials have been outdoing each other with graphic descriptions of a gang that, according to the FBI’s National Gang Intelligence Center, has 30,000 members worldwide and around 10,000 in the US.

The secretary of homeland security, John Kelly, described their supposed role in smuggling immigrants into the US as “a course north that rivals Dante’s journey into hell”.

Kelly was followed by Sessions, who said “depravity and violence are their calling cards”. He was followed by Trump, who added: “They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference ... We are out in Long Island, cleaning out the MS-13 scum.”

Thus, the blue-collar communities of Central Islip and Brentwood – with their brightly decorated Spanish-language restaurants serving Salvadoreans, Guatemalans, Mexicans and other Latino communities – have become the prima facie justification for President Trump’s immigration crackdown.

It is a bitter confluence: a president, so far thwarted in his anti-immigration agenda and now looking to make a mark, coupled with a criminal gang that has spread through poor immigrant communities virtually unimpeded, many say, by law enforcement.

In a recent roundup of 13 suspected MS-13 gang members, seven had entered the US as unaccompanied minors, giving what many fear will be false justification to an administration that has been accused of trying to scapegoat immigrants in the service of a racial agenda.

“These are ugly, brutal events, so for Sessions to come in here to score political points is insulting,” said Foster Maer of campaign group LatinoJustice, who had come to the courthouse with dozens of others to protest at the attorney general’s visit. He accused Sessions of grandstanding for attention and warned that a heavy-handed, poorly targeted crackdown would serve to exacerbate a growing sense of ostracism within immigrant communities.

Maer claimed discrimination had contributed to authorities failing to heed warnings about MS-13 violence or to investigate MS-13-related activity when Latino teens began to disappear last year.

“The failure of local police to welcome the Latino community and gain their trust has created this. Law enforcement put its head in the sand when the murders started a year ago,” Maer said. “They refused to investigate. It wasn’t till two girls disappeared that they started looking.”

The young age of both the victims and perpetrators has added to the growing sense of alarm here.

Prosecutors described the killings of the two teenage girls, Mickens and Cuevas, as a homicidal overreaction to a dispute between pupils and gang members at Brentwood High School a week earlier. The four young men arrested for the girls’ murders, who are aged between 19 and 22, are believed to subsequently have been directed by MS-13 leaders to set on them with baseball bats and machetes.

Evelyn Rodriguez, Cuevas’s mother, said her daughter had been bullied for two years before she was killed. Students at the school, Rodriguez said, “can’t walk the halls without fear”.

Suffolk County’s police commissioner, Timothy Sini, said there was no question that MS-13 was recruiting children who may be unaccompanied or unsupervised. The youngsters “don’t have an established social network, at least many of them don’t, and MS-13 is providing that network,” he said.

According to local community organiser Katie Costanzo, Latino students are more likely to be expelled or suspended, making them easy marks for gang recruiters, who then demand elaborate criminal initiations. “If you’re not in school, you’re going to be on the streets. Who is going to accept you if you are on the streets? The gangs.”

Others fear that law enforcement will crack down on the community, sweeping up undocumented immigrants without effectively targeting the gang members, thereby achieving a political end without solving a crisis of criminality.

“A crackdown is not needed,” said one community organiser who did not wish to be identified. “This is going to be used to justify sweeps and mass deportation.”

MS-13, the community organiser said, were merely perpetuating the customs of extortion they practice in El Salvador and Honduras. Many of the original members of MS-13 were deported from Los Angeles in the 90s, and restored its power base in El Salvador. Authorities believe it is now sending members north to carve out new territory.

“They do what they know. If you’re part of this gang, you’re in it for life. If you come to this country, you have to seek out and find other individuals involved,” said the community organiser. But since the recent murders of the four teenagers, and the subsequent attention from outside the area, he said, “anybody they’re looking for is not here any more. They already left.”

Nonetheless, the political class is gathering with promises of firm action. New York governor Andrew Cuomo, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, also visited the area, promising “undercover work” and an expansion of an anti-gang task force.

Some of the force were in evidence last week, patrolling in unmarked cars, the seriousness of their demeanour contrasting with the vibrancy of the community and the constant musical beats coming out of storefronts. Asked how they planned to tackle MS-13, the black-clad agents in bulletproof vests said simply: “No comment.”",guardian.com,False

Many of the photographs highlight the poverty in 1950s Paris, where Stafford was living with her first husband, a British foreign correspondent. In the poor quarters of Bastille and Boulogne-Billancourt, Stafford found street children living around the notorious slums of Cité Lesage-Bullourde, now the site of the Paris Opera Bastille.

Other photographs in the show follow the development of Stafford’s photo-documentary approach to fashion shoots. She took the models out on to the boulevards and squares. “Fashion photography was a double-edged thing,” she said. “On the one hand it was marvellous, all the beauty of the designs and the fabrics was delightful. But the business end of it had its dicey side.”

Stafford’s first front-page picture was taken for the Observer from North Africa in 1958, showing fleeing Algerian refugees. “I was very involved with the Observer. Either I was sent out on assignment and did what I had to do, or I instigated my own projects. My particular interest was to see humanitarian issues through my camera and draw attention to them. The picture I loved most is of a refugee mother holding this poor little infant. That image meant more than anything else. I wanted to do a story about the refugees. I believe that documentary work should raise social issues, and was very happy when other photographers and journalists were commissioned to go out and record the situation.”

Growing up during the Depression in America, Stafford was aware, she said, not just of the poverty of hungry migrants from the Dust Bowl, but also of those fleeing Germany to safety before the second world war.

“I congratulate myself for surviving so long, but I have never put myself in positions of real danger. I was very friendly with Bob Capa, and once he suggested that I go to work with Chim, the working name of another Magnum photographer, David Seymour, as an assistant. But I knew he was a war correspondent, so I said I would not go. And, of course, both of them were killed covering conflicts.”

Stafford has launched an award in her name for young female photographers. “The object is to give women a little bit of money towards building up a photo essay that addresses important issues. I am doing it in conjunction with the arts organisation FotoDocument [submissions by 26 May],” Stafford said. “Life has been good to me, so I felt I should try to give something back. When I started out it was very hard for a woman in Fleet Street, and I am sure, although it has improved, that that is still true.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/29/new-labour-20-years-on-tony-blair-david-miliband-peter-mandelson-alastair-campbell,"They all remember the sunshine. Talk to those who were there on 1 May 1997, and everyone mentions the way the whole country seemed to glow under bright blue skies and a warm sun. It had been that way for much of the campaign, but those at the centre had barely had a chance to enjoy it. Now, on polling day, time at last seemed to slow down. For those few hours, there was nothing more that the small, tight group at the heart of New Labour could do, except wait.

Thanks to Theresa May’s decision to call an early election, the campaign of 2017 will encompass a poignant milestone: the 20th anniversary of the biggest landslide in British political history. On Monday, two decades will have passed since Tony Blair led Labour to a triumph so complete it eclipsed even the groundbreaking win of 1945. While Clement Attlee racked up a Commons majority of 145 seats, Blair managed 179. Nothing like it had been accomplished before – or since.

When you’d lost as many elections as we had, you believed right until the end that some unforeseen event could derail us

Drawing on conversations with the key players who propelled Blair and Gordon Brown into power – Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson, Ed Balls, David Miliband, Anji Hunter, Jonathan Powell and others – it’s possible to glimpse again that extraordinary day when Britain turned its back on 18 years of Conservative rule and stepped into an unknown future, led by a group of people who, as one puts it now, had “no idea what the inside of government even looked like”. They tell stories of jubilation and mild panic as the results came in – and of landmark achievements and enduring regrets, as that victory turned into a 13-year spell in government.

On the day itself, no one was allowed to celebrate, not until all the votes were counted. For Blair, it was part superstition (don’t jinx it by taking it for granted), part bitter experience. “When you’d lost as many elections as we had by 1997, you believed right until the end that some unforeseen event could derail us,” says Mandelson, then MP for Hartlepool and campaign director.

Blair had been in that frame of mind throughout. When he saw the front page of the Observer on the Sunday before polling day – with its headline, above a portrait of himself, “Starting this week: a new era” – he was “appalled”, remembers Hunter, who until 2001 served as the leader’s gatekeeper and unofficial voice of middle England. Blair had refused to say or do anything that smacked of presumption or complacency, even when every poll showed he was on course for Downing Street.

On 1 May, he allowed himself a small exemption: since there was no more campaigning to be done, he agreed to discuss tentative plans for the Labour government that might – all conversations had to be framed in the conditional – begin the next day. At Myrobella, the former pit manager’s house he had in his Sedgefield constituency, he took his first peek at the document chief of staff Jonathan Powell had drafted, outlining a plan for Labour’s first 100 days in office. Until then, Powell says, “He hadn’t wanted to look.”

Blair alternated between pacing inside the house and sitting in the garden. “He was apprehensive,” Powell recalls. “He’d call Sally [Morgan, a senior political aide] and say, ‘What’s going on?’ She’d make stuff up: ‘Oh, turnout’s good in the East Midlands.’ It was complete nonsense. Anything to get him to shut up.”

Mandelson, Campbell, Powell and Hunter were all there. John Prescott came over from Hull, before heading back to his own count. In the garden, “We permitted ourselves a theoretical discussion of who might fill various posts,” Mandelson remembers. But mainly they remained in the same curious state of limbo, halfway between opposition and government. “There was a sense that everything was happening in slow motion,” he says.

“I was completely exhausted,” recalls Campbell, then Blair’s spokesman and right-hand man. The campaign had been relentless and Campbell had been fierce about maintaining discipline, including over his own emotions. But the night before, he had been on the phone with his 10-year-old son, Callum, who asked, “Are we going to win?” That “we” was too much. “I put the phone down and I started crying. I cried for about half an hour.”

Meanwhile, on the streets of Enfield Southgate, David Miliband, then Blair’s head of policy, was canvassing with Stephen Twigg, a former student leader whose hopeless task was to take on the Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo. They’d been leafleting big houses: obviously solid Tory ground. Eating lunch at a pub, Twigg laughingly revealed that Millbank, Labour HQ in those days, had sent him a draft victory speech. “No chance of that happening,” he said, unaware that a matter of hours later his sheepish grin, alongside a shell-shocked Portillo, would become one of the defining images of the election.

Eventually, evening came. A BBC contact had leaked to Hunter the details of the exit poll. But Blair shooed her away. “He didn’t want to hear it.”

At 10pm, David Dimbleby forecast an enormous Labour win. The early results confirmed it. But still the inner circle was counting no chickens. At one point, hearing that champagne corks were popping at Millbank, Campbell got on the phone to give the London team a carpeting. Not the right look for the cameras, he barked. Press officer David Hill told him, “We are about to win the biggest victory in our history and end 18 consecutive years of Tory government. I think it’s going to be a little hard to tell them all to look sombre.”

My pager kept going off: Labour gain, Labour gain, Labour gain, Labour hold, Labour gain, Labour gain…

Blair once told me of the moment Bruce Grocott, his parliamentary private secretary, came to him and said, “I’ve got good news and bad news. The good news is, you’ve won by a landslide. The bad news is, landslides happen.” Even the prospect of massive victory was tainted by the familiar Labour angst: they might be voting you in, but they could just as easily throw you out.

Soon, John Major rang, conceding defeat. Blair took the call in the house’s small study; Campbell and Powell huddled around, trying to listen in. Campbell remembers that Blair was “wearing a rugby shirt, shorts and these ridiculous fluffy slippers. It didn’t feel like a historic moment.”

It was time to head to Blair’s count. His son, Nicky, couldn’t be woken and had to be carried to the car; this team of political sorcerers were still young. Campbell, who had intimidated the entire Westminster press corps, was 39; Blair was not yet 44. As he went into the sports centre where the Sedgefield votes were being tallied, Campbell gave a TV interview, again stressing that nothing could be taken for granted. His demeanour was downbeat. His pager, state-of-the-art technology at the time, started buzzing as colleagues asked the same question: “What is wrong with you?”

Mandelson flew to London alongside novelist Robert Harris, granted access for an insider’s account. “As we flew down, we listened to the radio – we must have been flying low – as one after another of these southern coastal seats began falling like dominoes.” Campbell was on another flight, with Tony and Cherie Blair. “My pager kept going off: Labour gain, Labour gain, Labour gain, Labour hold, Labour gain, Labour gain…”

Meanwhile, Ed Balls, then right-hand man to Brown, was dozing in the back of a car as he was driven to London from Castleford where his wife, Yvette Cooper, had just been elected as MP for the first time. At one point, Balls woke with a start: the driver, a trade union volunteer, had let out a roar on hearing the news of Portillo’s defeat.

I refuse to list Iraq as an upfront regret, because I don’t believe it

Once in London, the Blair team headed towards the victory party at the Royal Festival Hall. They arrived to a crowd of activists, MPs, trade unionists, celebrities and party workers in a state of near ecstasy. I remember it well: I was there, notebook in hand, watching as Richard Branson mingled with John Edmonds of the GMB, and as a delighted, relieved Neil Kinnock danced with Peter Mandelson. As the sun came up, Blair ad-libbed that line with its oddly Majoresque cadence: “A new dawn has broken, has it not?”

But the euphoria of the crowd, felt across much of the country on that Friday morning, did not fully extend to those on the inside. “I was scared,” Blair wrote in his memoirs. Hunter thinks “the weight, the awesome responsibility” pressed in on him. What was going through her mind? “Tony needs to have a sleep, that’s what I was thinking.”

The Blairs went back to their Islington home to get a few hours rest – a drowsy Cherie famously snapped by a waiting press pack as she opened her front door - but the others either got much less sleep or none at all. Powell went to Downing Street, charged with performing in a few hours a transition from one administration to another that in the US takes three months. Mandelson went to Millbank, partly to mug up on a parliamentary Labour party now boosted to 418, including scores of new MPs “who we’d frankly not heard of and knew nothing about”. Brown and Balls headed for the Treasury, where they handed stunned civil servants a letter announcing their intention to make the Bank of England independent. Immediately.

At around 6am, David Miliband and his wife, Louise, walked across Waterloo Bridge, stopping to watch the morning sun glinting on Big Ben. “I guess I thought, ‘What do we do now?’” he recalls.

***

I asked these key players in New Labour to name three things they were proudest of in the years after the great landslide, and three regrets. The positives were easy, though not entirely what I predicted.

Naturally, Powell offered the Good Friday agreement, in which he was intimately involved, while Campbell cited the military intervention in Kosovo. (Campbell was sent to get a grip on the communications effort for Nato during that war in 1999, and has retained his interest: he’s lost count of the young adults he has met in Albania called Tony Blair, named for the man their parents believe saved their lives.) Balls was proud of the decision to keep Britain out of the euro, as well as the post-2001 rise in national insurance to fund the NHS, a tax rise levied explicitly to pay for a public service: “No left-of-centre government had done that.”

Others ticked off signature New Labour achievements, the kind that used to be listed on giant TV screens as the warm-up video for the leader’s speech at party conference: increased investment in schools and hospitals; devolution to Scotland, Wales and London; the minimum wage; civil partnerships; sharp reductions in poverty among pensioners and children; a massive redistribution of wealth to the worse off through the creation of the tax credit system.

Miliband said he was proud that the 1997 government created the Department for International Development, while speechwriter and strategist Peter Hyman says he still admires the fact that Blair “never pandered on immigration”, and that, in those years, the country felt, broadly, tolerant, inclusive and optimistic: “It was the best time to be British.” All of them cite Labour’s three consecutive election wins, a sustained success that, again, outstrips Attlee’s. “The 1945 government was a shooting star: it had lost all of its energy by 1950,” Miliband says.

Twenty years on, the regrets are harder to talk about. Balls is critical of himself and his colleagues over the “searing event” of the 2008 financial crash. Like their fellow governments around the world, he says, Labour failed to see the “building problem” in the financial institutions until it was too late.

Nothing is more damning than the fact that, 20 years on, Jeremy Corbyn is leader and Labour is about to be annihilated

Others speak of the 2003 invasion of Iraq that devoured Blair’s second term and destroyed his premiership – though not without prompting. Defiantly, Powell says that, in terms of its impact on Britain, “Iraq will be forgotten in five or 10 years.” Likewise, Campbell says, “I refuse to list that as an upfront regret, because I don’t believe it.”

Thanks to Brexit, self-criticism comes more easily over Europe. “We didn’t talk Europe up enough,” Hunter says. “Everybody slightly pandered to the Daily Mail agenda on Europe – ‘the gravy train’ and all that. We didn’t fight that.” Miliband puts it succinctly: “We won arguments in Europe, but didn’t win the argument for Europe.”

Most of the class of 1997 reject the idea that it was their actions that stored up so much of the current trouble, starting with the suggestion that it was the arrival of 1.5m eastern European immigrants after 2004 that ultimately led to last year’s Brexit vote. No, they say: while it would obviously have been better to have managed that influx more gradually, it did not lead ineluctably to Brexit. The case for migration could have been made more effectively; David Cameron could have got a better deal from his renegotiation with Brussels. (Blair would have, Hyman says.) Balls is more unforgiving: “We thought globalisation would be all about the movement of goods and services; we didn’t anticipate that it would mean the mass movement of people.”

Only in one area are the founders of New Labour ready to see a direct line of responsibility and blame, and that is in the area that wounds them most deeply: the current plight of the Labour party, a few weeks out from what promises to be a very different general election.

“We have to take some responsibility for the state Labour is in today,” Campbell says. “We can’t say Corbyn happened in a vacuum. We didn’t cement the legacy.” Hyman goes further: “Nothing is more damning than the fact that, 20 years later, Jeremy Corbyn is leading the party and Labour is about to be annihilated.”

There have always been parts of the Labour party that find the discipline of government, of compromise, hard

The architects of New Labour watched as their record was first questioned and then rubbished. For that, many of the 1997 veterans blame Ed Miliband, about whom they can be scathing – and not just for making the rule change that meant party members alone, including ones who’d just signed up, could now elect the party leader, with no extra weight given to the views of MPs. They say that, by declaring New Labour “dead”, Miliband prepared the ground for Corbyn.

And so now Labour is led by a man who either never speaks of the last Labour government or, if he does, seems to regard it as an embarrassment requiring atonement. While the Tories exult in their victories, lionising their winners and boasting of their time in office, Blair is mainly cast as a source of shame. For his part, as if to confirm how much the political landscape has changed since 1997, Blair now suggests that people vote in June for the most anti-Brexit candidate – even if that means voting Tory.

Part of New Labour’s failure was one of personnel. Most agree that they failed to bring on a new generation, that fresh talent struggled to grow in the shade cast by Blair and Brown. But it goes deeper than that. Balls thinks New Labour was, in part, a victim of its own success. “There have always been parts of the Labour party that find the discipline of government, of compromise, hard. I think the party was quite exhausted by government. But, to be fair to Ed Miliband, that discipline held for another five years.” When 2015 brought a second election defeat, Balls says, “People said, ‘Oh God, can’t we just get back to dreaming? Can’t we be outsiders?’ So, in some ways, the success of Blair and Brown, being in power that long, caused a pent-up resentment about all the discipline and compromise.” After a long, hard hike on the road to power, electing Corbyn felt like sinking into a warm bath.

Some of the New Labour team wonder how things might have been had their bosses, Blair and Brown, been able to repeat in government the effective working relationship they had during the 1997 campaign, instead of allowing the tension between them to gnaw at New Labour from the inside. Powell’s big regret is that nothing came of the “project” of convergence – maybe even merger – with the Lib Dems.

As for the future, no one – not even the truest believer – suggests a simple resurrection of New Labour. They know that the world of late 1990s Britain has gone and is never coming back. But it’s worth remembering all the same. David Miliband says that if the party keeps disdaining its 13 years in power, if “we forget why it’s worth having a Labour government, we end up not having one”.

New Labour’s mistakes and misdeeds were legion – and, whatever Campbell and Powell say, Iraq surely belongs at the top of that list. Still, its key insight – that Labour could do radical things, but only once it had reassured the electorate it was fit to hold power – holds as true now as it did in 1997.

The founders of New Labour look back with pride at the victory they won two decades ago, but the memory is bittersweet. For they know the prize eventually slipped out of reach – as bright and brief as a glorious May afternoon.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/renamed-and-shamed-taking-on-britains-slave-trade-past-from-colston-hall-to-penny-lane,"Buildings, streets and statues across Britain commemorate men who may have been philanthropists, but also owned and traded slaves. Now a number of cities are starting to face up to their histories

Edward Colston is, says Katie Finnegan-Clarke, “almost like a cult figure” in Bristol. There is a Colston Street, and Colston Tower is on Colston Avenue. There is even a Colston bun, which you might eat on Colston’s Day. Finnegan-Clarke, one of the activists in the Countering Colston campaign, went to Colston’s Girls’ school, where “there are statues everywhere, and we had three ceremonies every year to celebrate his life.” Colston was a 17th-century philanthropist who gave great sums of money to the city – money he had made from slavery. This week it was announced that there would be one less Bristol institution bearing his name. The concert venue Colston Hall – which has been a target for activists for decades – will reopen in 2020, after its refurbishment, with a new name.

“We knew it was the right thing for the organisation,” says Louise Mitchell, the chief executive of the trust that runs the venue. “It’s very important to us as a progressive forward-looking arts organisation that we include everybody, and people felt uncomfortable entering the building because of the perception that it had in some way profited from the slave trade.”

That wasn’t technically true, she says – it was built nearly 150 years after Colston’s death, and was unimaginatively named after its address, Colston Street, but its name still stands as a memorial to the man. It has seen performances from giants such as Ella Fitzgerald, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and David Bowie, but the Bristol band Massive Attack have famously boycotted the venue because of its name.

“There are very strong views on both sides; we always knew there would be a backlash,” she says. “Some people are cheering, some are booing, but what I had to do was take the right decision for the organisation. We can’t be inclusive if people won’t come into the building.”

A poll for the Bristol Post had found that people opposed renaming the venue two to one, and there have been accusations of airbrushing history. “I think the organisations that hold him up in that honorary position are the ones who are airbrushing history,” says Finnegan-Clarke. “He was one of the most powerful slave traders in Britain: 85,000 Africans were kidnapped and enslaved while he was running the Royal Africa Company. I think by honouring him, that’s airbrushing history.”

The renaming of Colston Hall “is probably the first significant change in the UK,” says Nicholas Draper, director of the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at UCL. “There will be others. It’s a wider process that’s unfolding in the US, and is probably true in France to a degree. Anywhere there is the significant imprint of slavery, and maybe the wider imprint of colonialism, then this will happen more and more. We’ve had, in the end, a public culture that has been relatively unreflective of the post-colonial moment, and that’s no longer a tenable position.”

There are other campaigns in Bristol, a city built on wealth accrued through the slave trade. Countering Colston has its sights set on the large bronze statue in the city centre, which it wants moved to a museum. At the University of Bristol, there is a campaign to rename the Wills Memorial Building. Henry Overton Wills was from the tobacco-giant family, and Wills “symbolises the great wealth acquired through the enslavement of individuals of African descent,” says Asher Websdale, one of three students who started a petition. “It’s not a name that the student body can unanimously state they are proud to stand as a centrepiece in the university. Our history lacks the commemoration of women and people of colour; a name change could allow us to take a step toward rectifying this injustice.”

In February, a city councillor in Glasgow proposed – temporarily, but symbolically – renaming Buchanan and Dunlop Street, named in honour of tobacco magnates. Nina Baker, a Green party councillor, acknowledges it would take a huge effort to rename them permanently, but, she says, “I thought we could start the ball rolling by raising awareness. I’d seen something about Spain doing this, renaming streets that had been named after fascist-era people after women freedom-fighters.”

The same was proposed in Liverpool in 2006, about Tarleton Street, Manesty’s Lane and Clarence Street, but the idea was dropped – partly because it would have meant renaming Penny Lane, which was named to commemorate slave ship-owner James Penny, but is now more famous as the title of a Beatles song.

The US is ahead of Britain on this. This week, Confederate monuments were removed from streets in New Orleans. “The removal of these statues sends a clear and unequivocal message to the people of New Orleans and the nation: New Orleans celebrates our diversity, inclusion and tolerance,” says mayor, Mitch Landrieu. “Relocating these Confederate monuments is not about taking something away from someone else. This is not about politics, blame or retaliation. This is not a naive quest to solve all our problems at once. This is about showing the whole world that we as a city and as a people are able to acknowledge, understand, reconcile – and most importantly – choose a better future. We can remember these divisive chapters in our history in a museum or other facility where they can be put in context – and that’s where these statues belong.” Forrest Park in Memphis – originally named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Confederate general and first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan – was renamed in 2013; the KKK protested.

There are particularly strong campaigns around universities. In February, following a long wrangle, Yale announced it would change the name of Calhoun College (named after John Calhoun, a US vice-president and supporter of slavery,) but it will not remove symbols of him around the campus. In 2015, there were student-led protests at Princeton to remove former president and segregationist Woodrow Wilson’s name from the university (the university refused). Last year, Harvard Law School dropped its seal, which was based on the family crest of a slave-owner, Isaac Royall. The Rhodes Must Fall movement started in 2015 at the University of Cape Town, to remove a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes, and spread to other universities, including Oxford, which has a statue of Rhodes at Oriel College. Earlier this year, there was discussion about removing eugenicist Francis Galton’s name from a lecture theatre and laboratory at UCL.

Not everyone thinks renaming is the answer – and renaming, anyway, is only a small part of ongoing discussions about how countries should deal with their involvement in slavery. “The danger is we end up erasing the past rather than problematising it,” says John Oldfield, director of the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation at Hull University. “An alternative strategy might be to use these names as a way of drawing attention to the complexities. You should use those names to discuss the past, because that informs how we understand the present.”

He points to the way Brown University in the US has acknowledged its past. Brown is considered the leader on this issue: president Ruth Simmons commissioned a report on the university’s history, and as a result introduced a number of measures including establishing the Centre for the Study of Slavery and Justice, and an endowment fund to support disadvantaged children.

In Bristol, many say that it is not possible to forget the city’s connection to the brutal trade in human beings. “It cannot be airbrushed. There are so many other things in Bristol that remind us about the slaving past,” says Olivette Otele, a historian at Bath Spa university. The issue is that a name given to a place or building is “a recognition of a contribution, it’s a celebration”.

What is happening in Bristol, she says, “is important because it means Bristolians themselves are shaping their own present, and how they want to remember the past and write the future. It’s their decision, and I’m excited about the whole thing.”

Things get more complicated when one considers where such moves should stop. Draper likes to think of it in terms of a hierarchy, or concentric circles, where slave-traders would be the “bullseye”, with owners of enslaved people closely following, and people who benefited from the trade, the bankers who financed it, and people who had connections, however remote, in the outer rings. “We’d need to have some sense of where the boundaries are, or could be. But I think ‘slave-trader’ is something very difficult to push away.”

Does it matter if most people passing a statue or a place name have no idea who the commemorated person is? “Isn’t that exactly the point?” he says. “That we’re celebrating people, and have forgotten what they did?”

The writer Amit Chaudhuri was invited to address Rhodes Must Fall activists at Oxford in 2015. In a piece he wrote for the Guardian, he remembered how he hadn’t noticed the Rhodes sculpture when his wife was at Oriel College in the early 1990s, and recalled once looking in on a talk given by Enoch Powell, not with horror, but a feeling that the once-divisive politician was now irrelevant, a relic; it seemed to him as though we were heading towards genuine equality and diversity. But two decades on, he argues that something else entirely is going on, and points to “how narrow the culture has become in Britain, in a very insidious way”.

Over the last 20 years, and particularly since 9/11, he says, there has been a turn against multiculturalism – some people have become seen as a threat to “our” way of life, resulting in a kind of closing down. It was there in Theresa May’s vans targeting “illegal” migrants, he says, in fears over immigration and the nostalgia for past British “glories” that stoked Brexit, and in the government’s pitiful response to the refugee crisis.

The other thing that has happened, he argues, is a widening economic gulf between the rich and those who have suffered most from the economic crash. “The affluent of the past, who became affluent out of exploitation – statues of those people begin to kind of chafe.”

The statues and names, and the history they stand for, “seem to be in collusion with the closing down that’s happening, and the [class] who are protecting themselves. I think that’s part of why it has become more urgent today. I don’t know what the solution is, in terms of removing statues or renaming places, but at the same time, I can understand why it’s happening.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/29/marilyn-stafford-photography,"Marilyn Stafford’s photographs depict a century of change, from shifting dress shapes to the impact of world conflicts. Today they are also proof of the long and varied life of a unique artist.

The chic and the shabby: Paris in the 1950s by Marilyn Stafford Read more

Stafford, 91, who lives in Sussex, was born in Ohio in 1925 and launched her career with a 1948 amateur portrait of Albert Einstein, before going on to work alongside the famed photographers Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa. A new exhibition dedicated to her work opens on Saturday in St Leonards-on-Sea near Hastings, before coming to the Art Bermondsey Project Space in London in late June.

The show at the Lucy Bell Gallery features 67-year-old images remastered from damaged originals by the renowned darkroom printer Robin Bell. Many of the photographs highlight the poverty in 1950s Paris, where Stafford was living with her first husband, a British foreign correspondent. In the poor quarters of Bastille and Boulogne-Billancourt, Stafford found street children living around the notorious slums of Cité Lesage-Bullourde, now the site of the Paris Opera Bastille.

She took the models out on to the boulevards and squares. “Fashion photography was a double-edged thing,” she said. “On the one hand it was marvellous, all the beauty of the designs and the fabrics was delightful. But the business end of it had its dicey side.”

Stafford’s first front-page picture was taken for the Observer from North Africa in 1958, showing fleeing Algerian refugees. “I was very involved with the Observer. Either I was sent out on assignment and did what I had to do, or I instigated my own projects. My particular interest was to see humanitarian issues through my camera and draw attention to them. The picture I loved most is of a refugee mother holding this poor little infant. That image meant more than anything else. I wanted to do a story about the refugees. I believe that documentary work should raise social issues, and was very happy when other photographers and journalists were commissioned to go out and record the situation.”

Growing up during the Depression in America, Stafford was aware, she said, not just of the poverty of hungry migrants from the Dust Bowl, but also of those fleeing Germany to safety before the second world war.

“I congratulate myself for surviving so long, but I have never put myself in positions of real danger. I was very friendly with Bob Capa, and once he suggested that I go to work with Chim, the working name of another Magnum photographer, David Seymour, as an assistant. But I knew he was a war correspondent, so I said I would not go. And, of course, both of them were killed covering conflicts.”

Stafford has launched an award in her name for young female photographers. “The object is to give women a little bit of money towards building up a photo essay that addresses important issues. I am doing it in conjunction with the arts organisation FotoDocument [submissions by 26 May],” Stafford said. “Life has been good to me, so I felt I should try to give something back. When I started out it was very hard for a woman in Fleet Street, and I am sure, although it has improved, that that is still true.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/29/new-labour-20-years-on-tony-blair-david-miliband-peter-mandelson-alastair-campbell,"They all remember the sunshine. Talk to those who were there on 1 May 1997, and everyone mentions the way the whole country seemed to glow under bright blue skies and a warm sun. It had been that way for much of the campaign, but those at the centre had barely had a chance to enjoy it. Now, on polling day, time at last seemed to slow down. For those few hours, there was nothing more that the small, tight group at the heart of New Labour could do, except wait.

Thanks to Theresa May’s decision to call an early election, the campaign of 2017 will encompass a poignant milestone: the 20th anniversary of the biggest landslide in British political history. On Monday, two decades will have passed since Tony Blair led Labour to a triumph so complete it eclipsed even the groundbreaking win of 1945. While Clement Attlee racked up a Commons majority of 145 seats, Blair managed 179. Nothing like it had been accomplished before – or since.

When you’d lost as many elections as we had, you believed right until the end that some unforeseen event could derail us

Drawing on conversations with the key players who propelled Blair and Gordon Brown into power – Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson, Ed Balls, David Miliband, Anji Hunter, Jonathan Powell and others – it’s possible to glimpse again that extraordinary day when Britain turned its back on 18 years of Conservative rule and stepped into an unknown future, led by a group of people who, as one puts it now, had “no idea what the inside of government even looked like”. They tell stories of jubilation and mild panic as the results came in – and of landmark achievements and enduring regrets, as that victory turned into a 13-year spell in government.

On the day itself, no one was allowed to celebrate, not until all the votes were counted. For Blair, it was part superstition (don’t jinx it by taking it for granted), part bitter experience. “When you’d lost as many elections as we had by 1997, you believed right until the end that some unforeseen event could derail us,” says Mandelson, then MP for Hartlepool and campaign director.

Blair had been in that frame of mind throughout. When he saw the front page of the Observer on the Sunday before polling day – with its headline, above a portrait of himself, “Starting this week: a new era” – he was “appalled”, remembers Hunter, who until 2001 served as the leader’s gatekeeper and unofficial voice of middle England. Blair had refused to say or do anything that smacked of presumption or complacency, even when every poll showed he was on course for Downing Street.

On 1 May, he allowed himself a small exemption: since there was no more campaigning to be done, he agreed to discuss tentative plans for the Labour government that might – all conversations had to be framed in the conditional – begin the next day. At Myrobella, the former pit manager’s house he had in his Sedgefield constituency, he took his first peek at the document chief of staff Jonathan Powell had drafted, outlining a plan for Labour’s first 100 days in office. Until then, Powell says, “He hadn’t wanted to look.”

Blair alternated between pacing inside the house and sitting in the garden. “He was apprehensive,” Powell recalls. “He’d call Sally [Morgan, a senior political aide] and say, ‘What’s going on?’ She’d make stuff up: ‘Oh, turnout’s good in the East Midlands.’ It was complete nonsense. Anything to get him to shut up.”

Mandelson, Campbell, Powell and Hunter were all there. John Prescott came over from Hull, before heading back to his own count. In the garden, “We permitted ourselves a theoretical discussion of who might fill various posts,” Mandelson remembers. But mainly they remained in the same curious state of limbo, halfway between opposition and government. “There was a sense that everything was happening in slow motion,” he says.

“I was completely exhausted,” recalls Campbell, then Blair’s spokesman and right-hand man. The campaign had been relentless and Campbell had been fierce about maintaining discipline, including over his own emotions. But the night before, he had been on the phone with his 10-year-old son, Callum, who asked, “Are we going to win?” That “we” was too much. “I put the phone down and I started crying. I cried for about half an hour.”

Meanwhile, on the streets of Enfield Southgate, David Miliband, then Blair’s head of policy, was canvassing with Stephen Twigg, a former student leader whose hopeless task was to take on the Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo. They’d been leafleting big houses: obviously solid Tory ground. Eating lunch at a pub, Twigg laughingly revealed that Millbank, Labour HQ in those days, had sent him a draft victory speech. “No chance of that happening,” he said, unaware that a matter of hours later his sheepish grin, alongside a shell-shocked Portillo, would become one of the defining images of the election.

Eventually, evening came. A BBC contact had leaked to Hunter the details of the exit poll. But Blair shooed her away. “He didn’t want to hear it.”

At 10pm, David Dimbleby forecast an enormous Labour win. The early results confirmed it. But still the inner circle was counting no chickens. At one point, hearing that champagne corks were popping at Millbank, Campbell got on the phone to give the London team a carpeting. Not the right look for the cameras, he barked. Press officer David Hill told him, “We are about to win the biggest victory in our history and end 18 consecutive years of Tory government. I think it’s going to be a little hard to tell them all to look sombre.”

My pager kept going off: Labour gain, Labour gain, Labour gain, Labour hold, Labour gain, Labour gain…

Blair once told me of the moment Bruce Grocott, his parliamentary private secretary, came to him and said, “I’ve got good news and bad news. The good news is, you’ve won by a landslide. The bad news is, landslides happen.” Even the prospect of massive victory was tainted by the familiar Labour angst: they might be voting you in, but they could just as easily throw you out.

Soon, John Major rang, conceding defeat. Blair took the call in the house’s small study; Campbell and Powell huddled around, trying to listen in. Campbell remembers that Blair was “wearing a rugby shirt, shorts and these ridiculous fluffy slippers. It didn’t feel like a historic moment.”

It was time to head to Blair’s count. His son, Nicky, couldn’t be woken and had to be carried to the car; this team of political sorcerers were still young. Campbell, who had intimidated the entire Westminster press corps, was 39; Blair was not yet 44. As he went into the sports centre where the Sedgefield votes were being tallied, Campbell gave a TV interview, again stressing that nothing could be taken for granted. His demeanour was downbeat. His pager, state-of-the-art technology at the time, started buzzing as colleagues asked the same question: “What is wrong with you?”

Mandelson flew to London alongside novelist Robert Harris, granted access for an insider’s account. “As we flew down, we listened to the radio – we must have been flying low – as one after another of these southern coastal seats began falling like dominoes.” Campbell was on another flight, with Tony and Cherie Blair. “My pager kept going off: Labour gain, Labour gain, Labour gain, Labour hold, Labour gain, Labour gain…”

Meanwhile, Ed Balls, then right-hand man to Brown, was dozing in the back of a car as he was driven to London from Castleford where his wife, Yvette Cooper, had just been elected as MP for the first time. At one point, Balls woke with a start: the driver, a trade union volunteer, had let out a roar on hearing the news of Portillo’s defeat.

I refuse to list Iraq as an upfront regret, because I don’t believe it

Once in London, the Blair team headed towards the victory party at the Royal Festival Hall. They arrived to a crowd of activists, MPs, trade unionists, celebrities and party workers in a state of near ecstasy. I remember it well: I was there, notebook in hand, watching as Richard Branson mingled with John Edmonds of the GMB, and as a delighted, relieved Neil Kinnock danced with Peter Mandelson. As the sun came up, Blair ad-libbed that line with its oddly Majoresque cadence: “A new dawn has broken, has it not?”

But the euphoria of the crowd, felt across much of the country on that Friday morning, did not fully extend to those on the inside. “I was scared,” Blair wrote in his memoirs. Hunter thinks “the weight, the awesome responsibility” pressed in on him. What was going through her mind? “Tony needs to have a sleep, that’s what I was thinking.”

The Blairs went back to their Islington home to get a few hours rest – a drowsy Cherie famously snapped by a waiting press pack as she opened her front door - but the others either got much less sleep or none at all. Powell went to Downing Street, charged with performing in a few hours a transition from one administration to another that in the US takes three months. Mandelson went to Millbank, partly to mug up on a parliamentary Labour party now boosted to 418, including scores of new MPs “who we’d frankly not heard of and knew nothing about”. Brown and Balls headed for the Treasury, where they handed stunned civil servants a letter announcing their intention to make the Bank of England independent. Immediately.

At around 6am, David Miliband and his wife, Louise, walked across Waterloo Bridge, stopping to watch the morning sun glinting on Big Ben. “I guess I thought, ‘What do we do now?’” he recalls.

***

I asked these key players in New Labour to name three things they were proudest of in the years after the great landslide, and three regrets. The positives were easy, though not entirely what I predicted.

Naturally, Powell offered the Good Friday agreement, in which he was intimately involved, while Campbell cited the military intervention in Kosovo. (Campbell was sent to get a grip on the communications effort for Nato during that war in 1999, and has retained his interest: he’s lost count of the young adults he has met in Albania called Tony Blair, named for the man their parents believe saved their lives.) Balls was proud of the decision to keep Britain out of the euro, as well as the post-2001 rise in national insurance to fund the NHS, a tax rise levied explicitly to pay for a public service: “No left-of-centre government had done that.”

Others ticked off signature New Labour achievements, the kind that used to be listed on giant TV screens as the warm-up video for the leader’s speech at party conference: increased investment in schools and hospitals; devolution to Scotland, Wales and London; the minimum wage; civil partnerships; sharp reductions in poverty among pensioners and children; a massive redistribution of wealth to the worse off through the creation of the tax credit system.

Miliband said he was proud that the 1997 government created the Department for International Development, while speechwriter and strategist Peter Hyman says he still admires the fact that Blair “never pandered on immigration”, and that, in those years, the country felt, broadly, tolerant, inclusive and optimistic: “It was the best time to be British.” All of them cite Labour’s three consecutive election wins, a sustained success that, again, outstrips Attlee’s. “The 1945 government was a shooting star: it had lost all of its energy by 1950,” Miliband says.

Twenty years on, the regrets are harder to talk about. Balls is critical of himself and his colleagues over the “searing event” of the 2008 financial crash. Like their fellow governments around the world, he says, Labour failed to see the “building problem” in the financial institutions until it was too late.

Nothing is more damning than the fact that, 20 years on, Jeremy Corbyn is leader and Labour is about to be annihilated

Others speak of the 2003 invasion of Iraq that devoured Blair’s second term and destroyed his premiership – though not without prompting. Defiantly, Powell says that, in terms of its impact on Britain, “Iraq will be forgotten in five or 10 years.” Likewise, Campbell says, “I refuse to list that as an upfront regret, because I don’t believe it.”

Thanks to Brexit, self-criticism comes more easily over Europe. “We didn’t talk Europe up enough,” Hunter says. “Everybody slightly pandered to the Daily Mail agenda on Europe – ‘the gravy train’ and all that. We didn’t fight that.” Miliband puts it succinctly: “We won arguments in Europe, but didn’t win the argument for Europe.”

Most of the class of 1997 reject the idea that it was their actions that stored up so much of the current trouble, starting with the suggestion that it was the arrival of 1.5m eastern European immigrants after 2004 that ultimately led to last year’s Brexit vote. No, they say: while it would obviously have been better to have managed that influx more gradually, it did not lead ineluctably to Brexit. The case for migration could have been made more effectively; David Cameron could have got a better deal from his renegotiation with Brussels. (Blair would have, Hyman says.) Balls is more unforgiving: “We thought globalisation would be all about the movement of goods and services; we didn’t anticipate that it would mean the mass movement of people.”

Only in one area are the founders of New Labour ready to see a direct line of responsibility and blame, and that is in the area that wounds them most deeply: the current plight of the Labour party, a few weeks out from what promises to be a very different general election.

“We have to take some responsibility for the state Labour is in today,” Campbell says. “We can’t say Corbyn happened in a vacuum. We didn’t cement the legacy.” Hyman goes further: “Nothing is more damning than the fact that, 20 years later, Jeremy Corbyn is leading the party and Labour is about to be annihilated.”

There have always been parts of the Labour party that find the discipline of government, of compromise, hard

The architects of New Labour watched as their record was first questioned and then rubbished. For that, many of the 1997 veterans blame Ed Miliband, about whom they can be scathing – and not just for making the rule change that meant party members alone, including ones who’d just signed up, could now elect the party leader, with no extra weight given to the views of MPs. They say that, by declaring New Labour “dead”, Miliband prepared the ground for Corbyn.

And so now Labour is led by a man who either never speaks of the last Labour government or, if he does, seems to regard it as an embarrassment requiring atonement. While the Tories exult in their victories, lionising their winners and boasting of their time in office, Blair is mainly cast as a source of shame. For his part, as if to confirm how much the political landscape has changed since 1997, Blair now suggests that people vote in June for the most anti-Brexit candidate – even if that means voting Tory.

Part of New Labour’s failure was one of personnel. Most agree that they failed to bring on a new generation, that fresh talent struggled to grow in the shade cast by Blair and Brown. But it goes deeper than that. Balls thinks New Labour was, in part, a victim of its own success. “There have always been parts of the Labour party that find the discipline of government, of compromise, hard. I think the party was quite exhausted by government. But, to be fair to Ed Miliband, that discipline held for another five years.” When 2015 brought a second election defeat, Balls says, “People said, ‘Oh God, can’t we just get back to dreaming? Can’t we be outsiders?’ So, in some ways, the success of Blair and Brown, being in power that long, caused a pent-up resentment about all the discipline and compromise.” After a long, hard hike on the road to power, electing Corbyn felt like sinking into a warm bath.

Some of the New Labour team wonder how things might have been had their bosses, Blair and Brown, been able to repeat in government the effective working relationship they had during the 1997 campaign, instead of allowing the tension between them to gnaw at New Labour from the inside. Powell’s big regret is that nothing came of the “project” of convergence – maybe even merger – with the Lib Dems.

As for the future, no one – not even the truest believer – suggests a simple resurrection of New Labour. They know that the world of late 1990s Britain has gone and is never coming back. But it’s worth remembering all the same. David Miliband says that if the party keeps disdaining its 13 years in power, if “we forget why it’s worth having a Labour government, we end up not having one”.

New Labour’s mistakes and misdeeds were legion – and, whatever Campbell and Powell say, Iraq surely belongs at the top of that list. Still, its key insight – that Labour could do radical things, but only once it had reassured the electorate it was fit to hold power – holds as true now as it did in 1997.

The founders of New Labour look back with pride at the victory they won two decades ago, but the memory is bittersweet. For they know the prize eventually slipped out of reach – as bright and brief as a glorious May afternoon.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/renamed-and-shamed-taking-on-britains-slave-trade-past-from-colston-hall-to-penny-lane,"Buildings, streets and statues across Britain commemorate men who may have been philanthropists, but also owned and traded slaves. Now a number of cities are starting to face up to their histories

Edward Colston is, says Katie Finnegan-Clarke, “almost like a cult figure” in Bristol. There is a Colston Street, and Colston Tower is on Colston Avenue. There is even a Colston bun, which you might eat on Colston’s Day. Finnegan-Clarke, one of the activists in the Countering Colston campaign, went to Colston’s Girls’ school, where “there are statues everywhere, and we had three ceremonies every year to celebrate his life.” Colston was a 17th-century philanthropist who gave great sums of money to the city – money he had made from slavery. This week it was announced that there would be one less Bristol institution bearing his name. The concert venue Colston Hall – which has been a target for activists for decades – will reopen in 2020, after its refurbishment, with a new name.

“We knew it was the right thing for the organisation,” says Louise Mitchell, the chief executive of the trust that runs the venue. “It’s very important to us as a progressive forward-looking arts organisation that we include everybody, and people felt uncomfortable entering the building because of the perception that it had in some way profited from the slave trade.”

That wasn’t technically true, she says – it was built nearly 150 years after Colston’s death, and was unimaginatively named after its address, Colston Street, but its name still stands as a memorial to the man. It has seen performances from giants such as Ella Fitzgerald, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and David Bowie, but the Bristol band Massive Attack have famously boycotted the venue because of its name.

“There are very strong views on both sides; we always knew there would be a backlash,” she says. “Some people are cheering, some are booing, but what I had to do was take the right decision for the organisation. We can’t be inclusive if people won’t come into the building.”

A poll for the Bristol Post had found that people opposed renaming the venue two to one, and there have been accusations of airbrushing history. “I think the organisations that hold him up in that honorary position are the ones who are airbrushing history,” says Finnegan-Clarke. “He was one of the most powerful slave traders in Britain: 85,000 Africans were kidnapped and enslaved while he was running the Royal Africa Company. I think by honouring him, that’s airbrushing history.”

The renaming of Colston Hall “is probably the first significant change in the UK,” says Nicholas Draper, director of the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at UCL. “There will be others. It’s a wider process that’s unfolding in the US, and is probably true in France to a degree. Anywhere there is the significant imprint of slavery, and maybe the wider imprint of colonialism, then this will happen more and more. We’ve had, in the end, a public culture that has been relatively unreflective of the post-colonial moment, and that’s no longer a tenable position.”

There are other campaigns in Bristol, a city built on wealth accrued through the slave trade. Countering Colston has its sights set on the large bronze statue in the city centre, which it wants moved to a museum. At the University of Bristol, there is a campaign to rename the Wills Memorial Building. Henry Overton Wills was from the tobacco-giant family, and Wills “symbolises the great wealth acquired through the enslavement of individuals of African descent,” says Asher Websdale, one of three students who started a petition. “It’s not a name that the student body can unanimously state they are proud to stand as a centrepiece in the university. Our history lacks the commemoration of women and people of colour; a name change could allow us to take a step toward rectifying this injustice.”

In February, a city councillor in Glasgow proposed – temporarily, but symbolically – renaming Buchanan and Dunlop Street, named in honour of tobacco magnates. Nina Baker, a Green party councillor, acknowledges it would take a huge effort to rename them permanently, but, she says, “I thought we could start the ball rolling by raising awareness. I’d seen something about Spain doing this, renaming streets that had been named after fascist-era people after women freedom-fighters.”

The same was proposed in Liverpool in 2006, about Tarleton Street, Manesty’s Lane and Clarence Street, but the idea was dropped – partly because it would have meant renaming Penny Lane, which was named to commemorate slave ship-owner James Penny, but is now more famous as the title of a Beatles song.

The US is ahead of Britain on this. This week, Confederate monuments were removed from streets in New Orleans. “The removal of these statues sends a clear and unequivocal message to the people of New Orleans and the nation: New Orleans celebrates our diversity, inclusion and tolerance,” says mayor, Mitch Landrieu. “Relocating these Confederate monuments is not about taking something away from someone else. This is not about politics, blame or retaliation. This is not a naive quest to solve all our problems at once. This is about showing the whole world that we as a city and as a people are able to acknowledge, understand, reconcile – and most importantly – choose a better future. We can remember these divisive chapters in our history in a museum or other facility where they can be put in context – and that’s where these statues belong.” Forrest Park in Memphis – originally named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Confederate general and first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan – was renamed in 2013; the KKK protested.

There are particularly strong campaigns around universities. In February, following a long wrangle, Yale announced it would change the name of Calhoun College (named after John Calhoun, a US vice-president and supporter of slavery,) but it will not remove symbols of him around the campus. In 2015, there were student-led protests at Princeton to remove former president and segregationist Woodrow Wilson’s name from the university (the university refused). Last year, Harvard Law School dropped its seal, which was based on the family crest of a slave-owner, Isaac Royall. The Rhodes Must Fall movement started in 2015 at the University of Cape Town, to remove a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes, and spread to other universities, including Oxford, which has a statue of Rhodes at Oriel College. Earlier this year, there was discussion about removing eugenicist Francis Galton’s name from a lecture theatre and laboratory at UCL.

Not everyone thinks renaming is the answer – and renaming, anyway, is only a small part of ongoing discussions about how countries should deal with their involvement in slavery. “The danger is we end up erasing the past rather than problematising it,” says John Oldfield, director of the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation at Hull University. “An alternative strategy might be to use these names as a way of drawing attention to the complexities. You should use those names to discuss the past, because that informs how we understand the present.”

He points to the way Brown University in the US has acknowledged its past. Brown is considered the leader on this issue: president Ruth Simmons commissioned a report on the university’s history, and as a result introduced a number of measures including establishing the Centre for the Study of Slavery and Justice, and an endowment fund to support disadvantaged children.

In Bristol, many say that it is not possible to forget the city’s connection to the brutal trade in human beings. “It cannot be airbrushed. There are so many other things in Bristol that remind us about the slaving past,” says Olivette Otele, a historian at Bath Spa university. The issue is that a name given to a place or building is “a recognition of a contribution, it’s a celebration”.

What is happening in Bristol, she says, “is important because it means Bristolians themselves are shaping their own present, and how they want to remember the past and write the future. It’s their decision, and I’m excited about the whole thing.”

Things get more complicated when one considers where such moves should stop. Draper likes to think of it in terms of a hierarchy, or concentric circles, where slave-traders would be the “bullseye”, with owners of enslaved people closely following, and people who benefited from the trade, the bankers who financed it, and people who had connections, however remote, in the outer rings. “We’d need to have some sense of where the boundaries are, or could be. But I think ‘slave-trader’ is something very difficult to push away.”

Does it matter if most people passing a statue or a place name have no idea who the commemorated person is? “Isn’t that exactly the point?” he says. “That we’re celebrating people, and have forgotten what they did?”

The writer Amit Chaudhuri was invited to address Rhodes Must Fall activists at Oxford in 2015. In a piece he wrote for the Guardian, he remembered how he hadn’t noticed the Rhodes sculpture when his wife was at Oriel College in the early 1990s, and recalled once looking in on a talk given by Enoch Powell, not with horror, but a feeling that the once-divisive politician was now irrelevant, a relic; it seemed to him as though we were heading towards genuine equality and diversity. But two decades on, he argues that something else entirely is going on, and points to “how narrow the culture has become in Britain, in a very insidious way”.

Over the last 20 years, and particularly since 9/11, he says, there has been a turn against multiculturalism – some people have become seen as a threat to “our” way of life, resulting in a kind of closing down. It was there in Theresa May’s vans targeting “illegal” migrants, he says, in fears over immigration and the nostalgia for past British “glories” that stoked Brexit, and in the government’s pitiful response to the refugee crisis.

The other thing that has happened, he argues, is a widening economic gulf between the rich and those who have suffered most from the economic crash. “The affluent of the past, who became affluent out of exploitation – statues of those people begin to kind of chafe.”

The statues and names, and the history they stand for, “seem to be in collusion with the closing down that’s happening, and the [class] who are protecting themselves. I think that’s part of why it has become more urgent today. I don’t know what the solution is, in terms of removing statues or renaming places, but at the same time, I can understand why it’s happening.”",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/29/tiny-homes-boom-stressed-townies,"Anyone who has spent a long weekend cooped up in a caravan bickering with their family might question the desirability of holidaying in a confined space, but a new trend in the UK aims to make a virtue of just that. In meadows and woodland clearings across the country, small wooden cabins, some not much bigger than garden sheds, are springing up to offer stressed city dwellers a way of reconnecting with nature.

The tiny homes movement began in America in the 1990s and champions the idea of “pared-down” living as a means of escaping from consumerism and the shackles of mortgages, and leading more fulfilled lives. It has also been touted as an affordable solution to the housing crisis. But now tourism is waking up to the potential of tiny homes to give people a taste of the simple life without having to commit to a permanent lifestyle change.

Modern tribes: the staycationer Read more

On a peaceful smallholding on the Isle of Wight, Helen Cunningham is putting the finishing touches to three wooden cabins which she will rent out under the banner Tiny Homes Holidays. The cabins are designed to sleep four people and will have king-size beds, a kitchen, shower room and toilet, and dining area – all shoehorned into a space no bigger than 6x4 metres.

“We’ve been fans of micro-living for some time, having downshifted from a four-storey London townhouse to a small two-bedroom house on the Isle of Wight,” says Cunningham. “We just wanted to see if we could offer something with the same ethos for holidays that might spark people’s imaginations.”

Cunningham insists that the compact nature of the houses is part of their charm. “Being cosied up together is a great way to reconnect with your friends and family,” she says. “And I think people genuinely do have an interest in responsible tourism and like the idea of having a low footprint on holiday.”

She says the cabins will feel uncluttered and airy with lots of space-saving tricks, such as multi-purpose furniture and a mezzanine sleeping area. Eco-friendly measures include solar power, composting lavatories and water recycling, while guests will be able to try their hands at gardening, yoga and workshops in everything from creatively reusing clothes to breadmaking. A two-night stay will start from £185.

Builder Mark Burton was one of the first to spot the potential of micro homes and launched Tiny House UK six years ago, selling handcrafted wooden two-storey cabins. He originally saw them as an affordable way for students and young people to get on the property ladder, but says that 50% of his business now comes from clients wanting to offer holiday accommodation, from farmers looking to diversify to homeowners wanting to make a bit of extra money by renting out a space in the garden on Airbnb. His recent commissions include a 2.4x4.5-metre cottage on the Fresh Winds campsite in East Sussex and an off-grid cabin on a remote croft in Clashnessie Bay in Scotland.

The idea of a cabin in the woods to escape to at weekends is one that is well entrenched in parts of North America, Scandinavia and eastern Europe, but has never really caught on in the UK, largely due to a lack of affordable land. Tom Dixon of Canopy and Stars, which specialises in quirky accommodation from yurts to treehouses and cabins, believes this explains why “glamping” holidays have taken off in this country more than any other.

“We’re a very populated country and land is expensive, but I think that people still want that weekend escape and that’s why we are seeing people booking multiple weekends with us. Last year we had someone book with us eight times in a single year.”

Cabins are by far the most popular option in the Canopy and Stars collection and the company has doubled the number of cabins featured on its website since 2015. Prices range from around £80 a night for the simple Caban Cader, sleeping four, on a farm in Powys, up to £155 a night for Idaho Cabin, a romantic couples retreat in Sussex. Canopy and Stars also has a consultancy business, Timber!, to help would-be cabin owners realise their dreams.

The founder of Go Glamping website, Garri Rayner, reports a similar story. He has taken on 30 new glamping clients in the last month, most of whom are offering cabins or shepherd’s huts.

The love affair with cabins shows no sign of waning with televisions shows such as George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces and websites such as Cabinporn.com.

“The log cabin in the woods is a dream for a lot of people,” says Dixon. “It’s a chance to reconnect with what’s important, to switch off, to enjoy each other’s company, to play and to rejuvenate. It’s such a positive thing. And the built structure is only a part of the experience. What’s outside is just as important. We’re promoting a holiday in nature.

https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/29/quentin-tarantino-reservoir-dogs-tribeca,"Director tells Tribeca Festival first public screening of his debut was ‘a fucking disaster’ but revels in memory of dancing when Harvey Keitel came onboard

When Reservoir Dogs hit theaters in 1992, it rocketed a young filmmaker from obscurity and reinvented independent film. On Friday night, to mark the 25th anniversary of Quentin Tarantino’s gritty, violent and groundbreaking tale of crime and betrayal, the director and cast members Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel reunited for a screening at the Tribeca Film Festival.

“There are so many things about this movie where I didn’t know anything,” Tarantino said, onstage at the Beacon Theatre in New York. “If I could do it all again, I’d do it slightly differently.”



The screening was a jewel of this year’s Tribeca line-up. In contrast, Tarantino said of the film’s premiere at Sundance in 1992, “the first time we screened it was a disaster.

“It was our very first public screening. They didn’t have a scope lens for the projector and it’s a scope movie and I let them show it anyway. That would have been bad enough.”

The problems only escalated from there, he said. “It gets to the final climax and all of the sudden the lights come up. They go back down, and then almost as if on purpose as far as suspense is concerned, right at the height of the movie there’s a power outage and all the power goes out.

“So, [I thought] ‘OK, that’s what it’s like to watch your movie in public.’ It was a fucking disaster.”

According to Tarantino, things didn’t get much better when he went on the film festival circuit.

“It was great because [at the time] I had barely left Los Angeles county, let alone visiting other continents. The thing is, at a film festival screening sometimes people don’t know what they’re about to see. They read the program and hear a synopsis and that’s it, so it’s understandable that at a film festival that maybe this is not what they want to see and they have to leave.

“So I started counting the walkouts.”

At one such screening, Tarantino said, he counted 33 people leaving the theater.

Perceptions quickly shifted, the movie becoming a breakout hit at Sundance, being picked up for distribution by Miramax and quickly growing into a genuine cult hit. It also attracted its fair share of controversy thanks to its brutal violence. Until 1995, the film was barred from release on home video in the UK.

The shock value seemed to work. Tribeca co-founder Jane Rosenthal, in attendance on Friday, said Reservoir Dogs was the first time audiences noticed Tarantino.

“We’ve been noticing him and have been thrilled by him ever since,” she said.

The film is also known for making stars out if its cast, with early roles for Buscemi, Madsen and Roth, the last of whom called the film “a complete shift in my life”.

Keitel, however, was already a star. Tarantino was a fan of the actor and managed to get his now-legendary script into his hands. The movie’s producer, Lawrence Bender, had an acting teacher whose wife knew Keitel.

“It worked,” said Tarantino, who still gets excited talking about how his debut coalesced. “The next thing we knew, Harvey was leaving a message saying, ‘I read the script, I love it, I’d even love to produce it to get it going. Give me a call back.’

“It was an amazing experience and I think we danced around. That was the beginning of the beginning.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/michael-ignatieff-fight-academic-freedom-hungary-central-european-university-refugees,"Michael Ignatieff is living life in reverse. Most people opt for their most demanding roles early on, then a quieter life. But after a career in philosophy, novel-writing and journalism, Ignatieff chose politics in his native Canada, followed at the age of 69 by his most difficult role to date: rector of the Central European University in Budapest. It is a task that has led him into battle to defend academic freedom against the onslaught of the Hungarian government, as its populist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, strives to bring the CEU to heel through a new education law.

Under recent Hungarian legislation aimed at overseas-registered universities, staff will have to acquire work permits, which the CEU says will restrict its ability to hire staff. The government is also demanding that the university open a wing in America and that it no longer teach US-accredited courses.

Hungary’s liberals find a hero in their battle against Viktor Orbán Read more

Ignatieff and the university have secured the support of the European Union, which has launched legal action against Hungary over its new law. Brussels says it breaches the CEU’s right to exist and serve its students. Last week, as Orbán came out fighting when he addressed the European parliament, defending his law and claiming the real clash between him and the EU was about refugees, Ignatieff was in London, also talking about refugees.

Orbán has refused to take Hungary’s allocated number of refugees under an EU plan to deal with the exodus of people fleeing strife in Africa and the Middle East. Ignatieff, who was giving a lecture at the University of East London, described how the CEU, founded 25 years ago by the financial speculator George Soros , has striven to educate refugees, offering them the chance to transform their fortunes.

Some say that it is this work in particular that has provoked Orbán’s ire, and Ignatieff told his London audience that outreach operations with asylum seekers marooned in camps on the Hungarian border had been a point of conflict with the Orbán administration.

But – perhaps mindful of how the Hungarian government might monitor his every word – the CEU’s rector was at pains to point out: “We do not work with illegal immigrants. Every government has the right to protect its borders and its country’s sovereignty. The issue here is demonisation of people, the ‘othering’ of others.”

Before he took up his post at the university last year, Ignatieff had been teaching at Harvard. In 2011 he had stepped down from the leadership of the Liberal party of Canada.

“If you want to see hunger for learning, you see it in refugees,” he says. “We are proud to provide them with the education we can offer, albeit limited. Our hope is that by educating refugees, others will regard these folks as human beings.”

At the start of the refugee crisis, this recognition of the essential humanity of asylum seekers was apparent in the response of ordinary Europeans. Ignatieff recalls that the police in Munich asked on Twitter for extra food and blankets for refugees; people turned up with supplies within 20 minutes. The same happened at first in Hungary, he said.

“Now politicians are making a wilful attempt to confuse economic migrants with refugees – that is a distortion of the facts,” he says indignantly.

As he notes, refugee crises are not new in Europe. They happened after the first and second world wars, as well as after the Russian revolution, which brought his grandparents to Dover in 1919, where they were welcomed by the British. Ignatieff was born in Canada and had a peripatetic childhood while his father worked for the Canadian diplomatic service.

After an early academic career which brought him to King’s College, Cambridge, he moved into writing and broadcasting in Britain, which brought a Booker prize nomination for his novel Scar Tissue, a stint as a presenter of BBC2’s The Late Show, and a column in the Observer. In those London years he became a public intellectual, Renaissance-man pin-up, thanks to a shock of black hair, an educated Canadian drawl and a laidback persona. In 2003, Maclean’s magazine named him Canada’s sexiest cerebral man.

The dirty tricks that demonise George Soros | Nick Cohen Read more

Today, the hair is greyer and this is a far more impassioned Ignatieff. “I have done many things in my career but one thing I had not done was run an institution. When I arrived in Budapest, at first the government was very welcoming. But the geopolitical scene has changed and this is a fight I care about tremendously. If it is my job to defend academic freedom, then I will do it.”

It is also a chance for Ignatieff to reinvent himself as a darling of the progressives, who were dismayed by his take on international relations after 9/11. In 2003, he published Empire Lite: Nation-Building in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan, which argued that the US had a responsibility to create a humanitarian empire through nation-building and even force. That same year, this philosophy led him to support the invasion of Iraq, causing him to be criticised by human rights activists. Later, Ignatieff wrote a mea culpa.

Now he is on the frontline of the consequences of that invasion and the other recent traumas in the Middle East, as refugees make their way through Europe. But while his defence of academic freedom might please them, progressive thinkers may be surprised by his take on the refugee crisis, for his critique includes the theory that human rights law does not work as a solution. He points to the way that human rights of different groups now compete with one another and, faced with refugees, others counter the new arrivals’ rights with their own. The solution, he says, is to not depend on such a legalistic approach but to return to a concept of hospitality, found in religions.

“There is a deep tradition of welcoming the stranger in many religions, but while you have that culture you also have people struggling against fear. And this is genuine fear, it is not racist. You can’t just lecture people about doing their moral duty. Somehow we have to recover a sense of solidarity.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/30/timberlake-wertenbaker-playwright-renaissance-winter-hill-interview,"After 10 years of self-imposed exile, the playwright is enjoying a renaissance. However, she says that female dramatists are still being disregarded

Playwright Timberlake Wertenbaker was once one of Britain’s most celebrated female creative voices. Her best-known work, the modern classic Our Country’s Good, earned her an Olivier award when it opened at the Royal Court in 1988. It went on to scoop six Tony nominations on Broadway, and was followed by other theatrical successes including the highly acclaimed art world drama Three Birds Alighting on a Field. Wertenbaker’s path to sustained West End glory seemed a foregone conclusion. Then, inexplicably it seemed, the doors banged shut and the phone stopped ringing.

“I got to feel nobody wanted me. We are told that women limit their own ambitions, but how many offhand remarks should you take?” she asks. “Eventually you feel out of step with what’s going on.”

The pioneering playwright is busy enjoying a popular renaissance, with revivals of her work and a new play, Winter Hill. But, she argues, the situation for most women dramatists has not much improved during her absence. “It might seem there are more women playwrights today, but looking at the statistics it has not really altered. There’s perhaps more attention paid to young women now.”

The work of female writers continues to be restricted to smaller theatres, Wertenbaker believes. “The question of the bankability of women writers is like passenger attitudes to female pilots. Some feel they would rather not fly.”

It was this sense of inequality that lay behind her decision to desert the British stage for a decade: “I felt nothing was happening and got discouraged. I am a little shy and I have never been able to storm into a theatre and demand my play is put on, so maybe it was partly me.”

Wertenbaker, who lives in north London with her husband, the author John Man, has been described as both uncompromising and reclusive. She certainly guards her privacy carefully, but spoke to the Observer about her period of disaffection with British theatre.

“You can quite often have a play with a cast of 15 men, yet a play with mainly women is unusual. I write plays about men too, but can’t see why a theatre should feel that as it has one woman’s play programmed for a particular season, it doesn’t need two. It makes it difficult to survive long term.”

During the fallow years that followed a run of less successful plays, Wertenbaker went to America, where she was born, to lecture on drama in Washington DC. After returning to England in 2006, she used her linguistic skills (she speaks four languages) to adapt and translate a series of works for radio and theatre. In the last couple of years, however, she has found herself once more at the centre of original writing for the stage. “Theatres have started coming to me again. The Royal Shakespeare Company has been good and I am writing something for them about a stateswoman at the moment. And I had My Father, Odysseus on at the Unicorn.”

Her 2015 play Jefferson’s Garden, staged at the Watford Palace Theatre, was described by Guardian critic Michael Billington as “a stirring show about differing definitions of freedom and the nature of America”, and Wertenbaker is now planning another play for Watford’s artistic director, Brigid Larmour. In the same year, Our Country’s Good was revived at the National Theatre to much praise. The story about convicts sent to Australia in 1788, who put on a production of Farquhar’s Restoration comedy The Recruiting Officer, is based on Thomas Keneally’s book The Playmaker and has entered the repertory canon, as well as the school syllabus.

“It’s popular because it is about theatre and so theatre people like putting it on,” she says. “I am not complaining, but I have written other plays as good.”

Her new play, which premieres at the Octagon Theatre in Bolton on 11 May, tackles the boundary between political activism and extremism. Wertenbaker spent much of her childhood living in the Basque country, so says she has done a lot of thinking about social dissent. The theme of Winter Hill, she argues, is more relevant than ever. “There has been an increasing shutdown of lines of public resistance, and we are in a much more authoritarian world suddenly. I wanted to ask how you resist. How far can you go? And at what point do you go for violence, and at what cost?”

Inspiration came from a walk on the hill above Bolton that gives the play its title. “You are suddenly in moorland, with the Pennines stretching infinitely in front of you. You can look down on Bolton and Manchester and yet it feels very wild somehow, despite the transmitter on top of it. It is full of configurations and quite beautiful. I am not sure everybody knows how precious it is,” she says.

In her play, this hill is threatened with commercial development and a group of women attempt to defend it. “I would not call them environmentalists. They are just women and not politically engaged when the play starts. They have different attitudes to protest.”

Her own pedigree of dissent derives more from her Basque childhood than the few hours she spent with protesters at Greenham Common in the 1980s. “Basque separatists have only just formally laid down their arms a few weeks ago. Friends I grew up with were involved and they talked to me about it. Now they have moved towards a cultural expression of their passions.”

The play does not take a didactic line about protest, she says. “I am not a pamphleteer. I wanted to present people with all the valid arguments, and that is just as well because I change my mind all the time.”

If Wertenbaker appears to be riding a comeback wave this spring, this is not the way she sees it. Her translation and adaptation work has never stopped. In 2015 she was behind BBC Radio 4’s high-profile New Year’s Day 10-hour version of Tolstoy’s War and Peace, and she is also the first writer to adapt the Italian literary star Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan books for performance, with the third title coming to Radio 4 soon.

Wertenbaker’s productivity, she says, is enhanced by drinking green tea and by periods holed up in her Basque mountain cottage. “I work bankers’ hours and I don’t really believe in inspiration. A commission for a play is three quarters of the battle. It makes you focus. What really does it though is a production date!”

Looking back at her rise to fame in the mid-1980s after her first hit, The Grace of Mary Traverse, there is not much trace of nostalgia. “I was not really ‘there’ when Our Country’s Good first went on in 1988. I had just lost my partner and I managed to write the play, but that was all.” There is, though, the memory of a hopeful moment for women’s writing. “I wasn’t alone, of course. There was Caryl Churchill, and other women who later got discouraged. There was one season at the Royal Court Theatre that was almost all written by women. Little did we know that would not happen again in the following decade.”

For now, she takes comfort in the work of younger female dramatists she admires, such as Lucy Kirkwood, Alice Birch and EV Crowe. She has also mentored a few absolute beginners through the women’s theatre company Damsel Productions.

Does Wertenbaker think she earned her reputation as “a difficult woman”? “Some people say I am arrogant and I probably am, intellectually. But people in the theatre find me easy to get on with, I think. I am not very diplomatic, so that may have put some people off. But a playwright should be a bit difficult, of course.”

https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/apr/29/maxine-peake-corbyn-supporter-need-coup,"She used to be told she was too fat, too northern, too political. Decades into a stellar career, Maxine Peake is on fighting form

Maxine Peake looks at me and rolls her eyes. “Last time we met, you got me into trouble,” she says.

“Really?” I say, confused.

“Yes! I said there were no working-class actresses in Hollywood. And I took a load of flak for that. People were going, ‘Well, maybe if you acted a bit better, you might be there.’ Are you going to get me into trouble again?”

To be fair, Peake can barely open her mouth without saying something controversial. When I interviewed her six years ago, she was beginning to establish herself as one of the best actors of her generation. She had moved on from playing loud, blousy, funny girls on television (Twinkle in Dinnerladies with Victoria Wood, and Veronica in Shameless) to complex, heavy-duty characters (Myra Hindley in See No Evil) and sophisticated, career-driven women (barrister Martha Costello in Peter Moffat’s Silk).

Today, she is on the verge of becoming a great. In recent years, she has dominated Manchester’s Royal Exchange Theatre: as the shape-shifting fairy in Caryl Churchill’s The Skriker; as Strindberg’s fallen aristocrat Miss Julie; as self-deluding alcoholic Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire; and as a puckish but ferocious Hamlet, all directed by Sarah Frankcom.

Now, she has returned to TV in a powerful BBC drama. Three Girls is about Rochdale’s grooming scandal, which finally resulted in the conviction of nine Asian men for sexually abusing white teenage girls. It’s a difficult story to tell, one that could be sensationalist or inflammatory. But Three Girls is beautifully written by Nicole Taylor. It does not focus on the abusers, but the abused: three working-class girls betrayed by the council, the police, and the Crown Prosecution Service, as well as the men who stole their lives. The girls were written off by the agencies that should have protected them, because their lives were chaotic and they did not present as ideal victims.

But they are not the only victims. Peake plays Sara Rowbotham, the sexual health worker who repeatedly reported her concerns to the police that the girls were being abused – and was repeatedly ignored.

At one point, Peake’s Rowbotham is approached by a female officer who tells her that Greater Manchester police have decided to reinvestigate the abuse, years after dropping the case. The scene lasts only a few seconds, but stays with you. “Fuck off,” she tells the officer. “No, really, I mean it, fuck off. I’ve been in here, sat in here, for years, and what you’re demanding off me now I couldn’t pay you lot to look at for years. You swan in here with your Prada handbag, asking me to hand it over like you’re checking my gas meter.”

She displays an astonishing mix of emotions: fury, contempt, shock, heartbreak. Throughout, you see a single tear lodged in her eye which she never allows to fall. It is Peake at her very best: not flash, not actorly, just viscerally real.

“Philippa [Lowthorpe], the director, restored my faith in television,” she says. Apart from two series of The Village, an early 20th-century period piece in which she played long-suffering farmer’s wife Grace Middleton, Peake has been conspicuous by her absence from television. Why did she lose faith in TV? “Because there’s no time or money. I’d done a few jobs where I thought, ‘I need to step away from it now, because I don’t want to become one of those actors you meet who works a lot but are very unhappy and moans a lot.’ As soon as you arrive on a job, they let you know they’re unhappy. Certain actors forget they’re really lucky to be doing what they’re doing.” Names, please. She grins, looks tempted, then shakes her head. “I did a series, and it wasn’t Silk – I loved Silk – and after that, I thought, ‘You know what? It’s time to sit and contemplate.’”

We’re at a photo studio in Kentish Town, north London. Peake lived in London for a decade, but now she’s back in the north-west (in Salford) – her true home. Peake is a stylish, androgynous dresser. For years, she used to gad around in her grandad’s brogues, bought from the Co-op in the 1950s. Today she arrived wearing high-waisted brown cords, brown shoes, brown socks and a brown cashmere jumper. Every brown is a distinct shade, yet they all complement each other. She says her agent describes the way she dresses as the “Pilgrim father look”.

She grew up in Bolton, a dozen miles from Rochdale, to working-class parents who divorced when she was nine. She was 15 when her mum moved several miles away with a new boyfriend, and Maxine chose to move in with her beloved communist grandad, Jim, who became her mentor and gave her a political education.

In some ways, she was a rough-and-ready girl: she played rugby for Wigan Ladies, scrapped her way through school, was partial to a bit of inept light thieving. “We all did a bit, going into Bolton on Saturday. I wasn’t good at it, though. I had too much of a conscience. I used to think the store detective had followed me all the way home and would knock on the door and go, ‘Hello, is this your daughter? She’s got three blue lipsticks and a moisturiser from Boots in her bag.’ We just used to nick crap. Not even stuff we wanted.”

When I was young, I thought I’d never have a boyfriend. I was fat and people took the mickey. My armour was to be funny

Yes, she says, had life taken a wrong turn, she could have been one of the teens in Three Girls. “I had two friends who were fostered, and they went through this. We used to hang around street corners at 12, 13, and cars would pull up, driven by men aged 26, 27. I witnessed young girls getting in the cars, and coming back and not talking about what had happened. I was quite prudish. I had friends who lost their virginity at 13, and I’d be like, ‘Disgusting!’”

Despite her prudishness, as soon as Peake started to act, she was stereotyped. “They think if you’re from up north, you’re up for it. Good-time girls. ‘Ooh, she likes a laugh!’ You mean, ‘She’s promiscuous.’ And again, it all ties into class, doesn’t it? Northern working-class women are obviously a bit loose. This is what this drama is about: how people perceive these young girls.”

Peake says she always wanted to be an actor, but didn’t think it was feasible, so set her heart on being a comedian. “That seemed more possible than acting, because I didn’t think I looked like an actor.” Why? “I didn’t see dumpy 11-year-olds with basin haircuts. I was quite big, and got bigger.” Did it worry her? “No, I thought that was just the way I was. I thought, ‘I’m not going to have a boyfriend, no one will fancy me, and I’m fat and people take the mickey out of me.’ But that was my armour as well. I could be the funny girl.”

She didn’t become a comedian. In fact, she went to study drama at Rada, ironically thanks to a scholarship handed out by the Daily Mail, which she despised. At Rada she was told she would never play Juliet if she didn’t lay off the chips. “I went, ‘What would I want to play Juliet for? She’s well boring. I mean, killing yourself at 14 for love? Ridiculous!’” At Rada, she became known as Red Max.

By the age of 23, she was 15 stone and starring as tardy, sarky Twinkle in Dinnerladies (“All right, keep your scrotum on,” she would tell canteen manager Tony). It was the show’s creator, Victoria Wood, who gave her the warning that changed her life: “She said, ‘You’re big, you’re blond – take it from me, you’ll get typecast.’ Despite all her amazing work, I think Vic wanted to be taken seriously as an actor.” Peake did Weight Watchers, lost five stone, and her career blossomed.

She says she has experienced pretty much every ism going: blondism, sexism, sizeism, northism. “I was talking to a young actor from Hull, and she was telling me what people say to her in auditions. I said you could have people in front of a tribunal if it was another line of work. Now, people are like, ‘Oh, she’s a proper actress’, but if I had taped the way they challenged your intellect. They’d say, ‘She’s been educated, she’s been to university: can you lose the accent.’ Or, ‘Have you read the script?’ and I’d go, ‘Yes’, and they’d say [whispering], ‘You do know she’s not from the north.’ I can read, we’ve got schools up north, we’ve got electricity.” Did she always respond in that way? “No, did I heck. I’d just sit there and go, ‘Yes, I know. Please give me a job.’”

She seems easy in her skin these days, I say. “It’s because I don’t care now.” Really? “I don’t care as much. I care about my work, but I don’t care about getting it wrong. The more you do, the more you realise nobody’s going to die.”

So many actors angst about everything. “Yes, because they think too highly of themselves. People go, ‘Oh, I’m so unconfident, I’m so damaged.’ Well, that’s because they love themselves far too much. And I go, ‘Look, this is what I’ve got, I don’t particularly like myself, and I don’t hate myself, just get on with it.’”

Another reason she’s stopped caring, she says, is because she’s become immune to criticism. “I’ve taken so much flak.” What for? “My politics. The Bolton News is the best place for online comments. They say I’m an absolute idiot and a communist anarchist.” And this really does outrage her. “I was never an anarchist, I was a communist!” She joined the party when she was living with her grandfather, and quit when she was 21 and at Rada. “I left because I became self-obsessed and got wrapped up in drama school and acting.” How would she define herself today? “I’m a socialist. In the Communist party, we always said a communist is a socialist who means it!”

Her critics have another misconception, she says: that she’s loaded. “Everybody thinks you’re a multimillionaire, so I’m not allowed to have an opinion on society, because, obviously, I’m far too rich and above it!” Does that piss her off? “Well, yeah, it does. That’s why I don’t do Twitter and Facebook, because I’d spend my time going, ‘F you. Where d’you live, let’s have this out in person, shall we?’”

But these are small gripes. Success has been great. It has given her the confidence to say yes to new things, rather than running away from the unknown. Peake has just finished directing her first short film, set in the 1960s, about a young couple with a child affected by thalidomide, and wants to make a full-length feature. When she was asked by the Guardian to write a short film about Brexit, she instinctively said yes, even though she didn’t have a clue what she was going to do. She’s learned so much from the great writers she has worked with (Paul Abbott, Carol Morley, Wood, Peter Moffat) that these days she is convinced she’ll be able to busk it.

“What’s that Andy Warhol quote? ‘Art is getting away with it.’ ” The funny thing is, she says, now she’s being stereotyped because of the smart women she has played. “People think I’m clever, which is hilarious. I’m like, ‘When did this happen? People used to think I couldn’t string a sentence together.’”

She talks about working with Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch – both Eton-educated “and probably the nicest people I’ve worked with” – and how they have an innate self-belief. “Why can’t we give people that at comprehensive schools, that sense of entitlement, that you can. We were taught, ‘You can’t, it’s going to be hard’, whereas they’re taught, ‘You can, it’s possible.’ That’s what I feel now, because I’ve got to that privileged place. I think, ‘Course I can, why not?’”

This is how she came to play Hamlet. “We’d done Miss Julie, they asked, ‘What do you want to do next?’ and I thought, ‘Balls, why not? Let’s have a go at Hamlet.’ I’d never had a burning desire to do Shakespeare, because it was like, ‘It’s not really for you, it’s difficult.’”

She thinks of her mother, Glenys, who died eight years ago and worked in a department store and as a carer. Peake says Glenys was talented, but never had the opportunity to fulfil her potential. “She was brilliant at drawing and one day she said, ‘I wish I’d gone to art school.’ And the way she dressed; it was all charity shops, but people always said, ‘Your mum looks really sophisticated.’ She had that eye.”

She says her mother would have loved to have been middle class – as indeed she would have back then. “Middle class to me was books. We didn’t have books in our house. Middle class was the kids whose parents were teachers, and they’d have carvings from Africa and loads of books and vinyl, and their mum and dad liked Fleetwood Mac.”

Could she have a relationship with a Tory? 'No.' A Lib Dem? 'No!' A New Labourite? 'God, no! I’d rather be with a Tory'

Peake says she learned from seeing her mother thwarted. Not least with men. “That’s why I moved in with my grandad, because she met a guy and moved to Leyland, and I didn’t want to move and I didn’t like the guy. She went for obnoxious men. I don’t know why. She was a caring person. She’d pick everyone up at the bus stop if it was raining. But I’d say, ‘Stop letting these men shape your opinions.’ After she got out of her last disastrous relationship, she got proactive and vocal. And I thought, ‘Wow, that’s the woman I knew was there.’”

Did it affect Peake’s own attitude towards men? “Yes – even with my dad. I thought, ‘I don’t know if that’s something I really want to give myself over to’, because it was like her entire life was spent servicing these men.”

Peake, 42, lives in Salford with her partner, television art director Pawlo Wintoniuk, whom she calls her soul mate. “He’s better informed than I am, and he thinks I’m a lot better informed than I am. Which makes me laugh.”

Do they always hold a party line? “Usually. We never row about politics.” Could she have a relationship with a Tory? “No.” A Lib Dem? “No!” A New Labourite? “God, no! I’d rather be with a Tory. Well, same thing.”

Peake and Wintoniuk have tried to have children (they underwent IVF treatment unsuccessfully) and Peake has been appalled by the things people have said to her about not being a mother. “After Mum’s generation, it felt like we’ll get a career off the ground, and now it feels as if it’s gone back to the role of wife and motherhood. You’ve got to have five kids to fill your 4x4. It’s a middle-class thing: they’re having these huge broods.”

She talks about the highly qualified women who devote themselves to competitively bringing up children because their partners have well-paid jobs. “When society gets like this, it turns insular. It becomes about the family, the little unit. Where does this cult of motherhood come from? We’ve gone so far back. We shouldn’t still be asking, ‘Have you got children? Why’ve you not got children? Ooh, you must have children!’ Bog off, d’you know what I mean?”

Actually, Peake says, she has never been convinced she wanted kids anyway. “We have talked about adopting, but then something comes along and I go, ‘Oh, but I’ve got this project to do.’ Somebody said yesterday, ‘Your work’s your babies’, and I thought, ‘Yeah, it is.’”

And there is so much more she wants to achieve work-wise. Would she like to work in Hollywood? “No. I was talking yesterday about actresses who’ve gone over there, and they don’t come back unscathed.” Has she been offered stuff. “No!” she shouts. Not even American Shameless? “No! Because I don’t register over there. I’d have to start again, and I don’t want to do crappy parts to get into something good. If I don’t care about what I’m doing, I can’t do it. I’m not that good an actor. That’s why I did Three Girls, because I cared about it.”

Would she go into politics? Long silence. “That’s one thing Pav said to me: ‘Please don’t go into politics, because I don’t see you enough as it is. I’ll never see you if you do that.’” She sounds as if she’s given it consideration. “The misogyny in that world, and the way you’re supposed to present yourself, I wouldn’t last.”

What does she think of Theresa May? “A terrible politician. How can you like her? And I can’t buy into this thing, ‘Oh, but she’s a woman.’ I don’t care.” What upsets her about May’s politics? “Her lack of care. I mean, we’re talking about another £30 being cut off disability benefits. I cannot believe the callousness. Why are we not in the streets rioting? Why are we not in the streets going, ‘You cannot treat people in this country like that’? It’s absolutely distressing when you go to Manchester and see the homeless people on the street. Every time I go back, there’s more.”

How does she feel about Labour? “I am a Corbyn supporter. My mind boggles why people treat him like the anti-Christ, but it goes to show people are a lot more right-wing than they like to believe. People say he’s not been vocal, but he is out at grassroots. Every time I go somewhere, he’s there.”

How does she feel about the snap election? “I am an eternal optimist, and I had a surge of excitement when the election was announced. This is a real opportunity to try to repair the devastating damage that the Tories have inflicted. I hope more than anything that their arrogance is completely misguided and they tumble dramatically.”

Peake says she can’t wait for a fightback to start. Would her ideal be peaceful revolution or violent revolution? “A bit of both. You can’t have a peaceful revolution now. Terrible thing to say. But we need a coup!” She gives me a look. “Have I got myself in trouble again? Oh, who cares, eh?” And off Citizen Max goes to fight the good fight.

The world treats your children as you have treated them,’ Neel once observed. And when she came to paint children, she was always concerned to treat them as equals. She also had some tricks to keep their attention. ‘She would suddenly miaow like a cat to keep the children interested while they were sitting,’ says Als. ‘I love this painting as a kind of perversion of a Sunday-school portrait. There is a kind of fierceness to the girls. Alice liked that. She wanted girls who would stand up to the challenge of being painted.’
