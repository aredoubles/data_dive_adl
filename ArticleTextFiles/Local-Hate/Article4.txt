Letters were rearranged on a message board welcoming back students into an anti-gay statement in Morris Hall between 9 p.m. Thursday and 8 a.m. Friday, police said, and anti-gay slurs were discovered drawn on a bulletin board in Reed Hall at 10:30 a.m. Friday and on a student's dorm room door at 10 a.m. Saturday.
Authorities don't know if the incidents were related, police said.
