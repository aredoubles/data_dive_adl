The Southern Poverty Law Center has announced a settlement of its federal lawsuit alleging that gay students were routinely bullied in a south Mississippi school district.
In a statement Wednesday, the law center says the Moss Point School District has agreed to adopt and implement new anti-bullying and discrimination policies and procedures, as well as equal educational opportunity policies to prohibit bullying and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
SPLC staff attorney Anjali Nair says complaints by students, parents and guardians will now quickly be brought to the attention of teachers and administrators.
