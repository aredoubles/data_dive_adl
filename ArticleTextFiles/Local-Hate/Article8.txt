Jackson State University officials called an act of vandalism in which racial epithets were spray-painted on an on-campus fraternity plot  "an isolated incident" not believed to be "racially motivated."
Images of the defacement to the Kappa Alpha Psi marble marker and bench, including the n-word, another racial slur, and a crude drawing, circulated widely on social media Tuesday.
Olivia Goodheart, director of public relations, said campus police are investigating the incident which is believed to have occurred sometime between late Monday evening and early Tuesday morning.
She cautioned that the act is not believed to be "racially motivated."
"We don't want the community in fear," or "to create any type of false impression," said Goodheart.
Assistant Chief of Police Dee McClendon said authorities do not have a suspect, but security footage is being reviewed.

"We don’t have any other crime or incidents that would make us think that this was anything other than an isolated incident," said McClendon.
Goodheart said that the university's facilities department has removed most of the graffiti and is in the process of restoring the marble obelisk.
