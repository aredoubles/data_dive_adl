A young man wearing a top hat cuts a cigar with a red sickle. His nose is distended into a hook. He is surrounded by images of French politicians under the heading: “The truth about Macron’s galaxy.” It doesn’t take much fluency in racist propaganda to see what is going on: here is the liberal candidate in France’s presidential election as archetypal Jewish conspirator at the hub of global capitalism and communism. The cartoon was posted a few weeks ago from the official Twitter account of Les Républicains, the party of François Fillon, a conservative rival for the presidency. It was quickly deleted. Fillon apologised and said errant staff would be disciplined. The election caravan moved on to bigger scandals. Emmanuel Macron is Catholic but that doesn’t confer immunity from vintage antisemitism. He worked for Rothschild, the investment bank, which every Jew-spotting paranoiac knows is synonymous with Israelite global manipulation. In the early 1990s, when I was studying in Moscow, there was a conspiracy theory doing the rounds that Boris Yeltsin’s real name was Baruch Yeltzer. For militant Soviet nostalgists and neo-Nazis it was unthinkable that the man who broke the USSR, thus humiliating Russia, could be a true-blooded Russian. So they rebranded him as a Jew. The end of the cold war stoked enmities that had been tranquillised for decades. Russians made crushing rebellion in the Caucasus sound like unfinished business from the wars of Tsar Alexander I. In the Baltic states, politics was steeped in recrimination over who had collaborated with whom in the competition for control between Nazis and the Red Army 50 years earlier. There were fears of a spiral into expulsions, plunder and genocide, as had happened when Yugoslavia’s national scars split open.

Photograph: Eliot Blondet/AFP/Getty Images   We tend to presume that history is formed at an even rate. If the passage of time is a constant, the past should always be getting further away. But it doesn’t work like that. At times of upheaval and disorientation, the past has a way of invading the present. When structures that looked immutable start to mutate, when political assumptions that were frozen solid begin to melt, forgotten layers of identity are revealed. The putrescent carcasses of buried conflicts are exposed, poisoning the air. The current crisis of confidence in western democracies does not equal the dissolution of the Eastern bloc. The European Union isn’t about to unravel as the Soviet Union did because, outside the lurid fantasies of Brexit provocateurs, the two entities are not alike. The EU is a collaborative project that respects human rights and political pluralism. The USSR was a one-party authoritarian superstate.     Europe in crisis? Despite everything, its citizens have never had it so good | Natalie Nougayrède           Read more       Yet the economic order that has prevailed without substantial challenge since the early 1990s looks brittle. Frustration at the impotence and self-absorption of a professional political class is epidemic. So is the perception that a financial elite has captured the proceeds of growth and that opportunities available to the next generation are more paltry than those enjoyed by their parents. The future of the west is shrouded in despondency – a feeling of epochal stagnation underscored by the relative dynamism of wrecker candidates preaching political sabotage. Perhaps collective inability to imagine what comes next is a factor reanimating the past. Or maybe at times of stress whole cultures, like individuals, fall back on gut reactions, fears and prejudices that rational cognition might overrule in calmer moments. Whatever the cause, there is something visceral and subliminal about the way politics across the west is fidgeting with anti-Jewish idioms. Whether intentional or not, there is antique spite lurking in the fashionable analysis that laments the excessive influence of “metropolitan elites” and “citizens of nowhere”. Soviet propaganda queried the patriotism of “rootless cosmopolitans”. When a Facebook army of the radical left rushes to defend Ken Livingstone from accusations of antisemitism, while depicting him as the victim of a campaign by “Zionists” or a shadowy “Israel lobby” that dictates the media’s script, it is worth pondering the etymology of that rhetoric. Nor has the normalisation of Islamophobia happened overnight. There are complex currents of anxiety arising from terrorist attacks in recent years and their conflation in public discourse with refugee flight from the Middle East and north Africa. But the deliberate misrepresentation by nationalists of an entire religion as a fifth column, harbouring who knows what level of murderous impulse, conjures a different spectre. Marine Le Pen in France and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands activate centuries-old reflexes of Christian recoil against the idea of encroaching Islam. When Brexit campaigners deployed posters suggesting Turks massing at the EU’s gates, they were probing dark recesses of the European psyche.

It isn’t much older than the 1707 Act of Union between England and Scotland, which is still pretty current in UK politics. And that was six years before the treaty of Utrecht in which Spain ceded sovereignty over Gibraltar. It is easy to dismiss the recent spasm of jingoism over the Rock as a silly ritual performed by a country that is jumpy ahead of tricky negotiations. But Brexit makes old agreements negotiable and that makes historical disputes more recent, which is a step towards making them dangerous. The more recently a conflict was frozen, the faster it defrosts. Taking evidence from Irish politicians, parliament’s Brexit select committee heard blunt testimony about the historical proximity of the Troubles. “The Good Friday agreement is … still a process and not a finished product,” notes the subsequent report. “If there are border posts and physical controls, they will become targets.” The blood stopped flowing recently enough that a botched EU deal can rip off the scab.     Northern Ireland's EU exit will destroy peace deal, says Gerry Adams           Read more       Maybe this sounds overwrought. We live in turbulent times but there are still boundaries to contain a surge in tribal European feuding and systematic racial scapegoating, aren’t there? I no longer know for sure. The sky is not falling. The ground beneath our feet is firm. But there is a whiff in the air, stale and sulphurous, as if rising from the soil after a thaw. It might pass. Or it might be the waking of dormant volcanoes.

It’s all too easy to blame Brexit for last week’s horrific assault in Croydon (Report, 3 April) that has left a teenage Kurdish-Iranian asylum seeker fighting for his life, but problems in this London borough are more longstanding. In July 1992, Ruhullah Aramesh, an Afghan refugee living in the Thornton Heath area of the borough, was beaten to death in a racist attack by six white youths armed with iron bars and lumps of wood. Many other racist assaults occurred there during that decade. In 2011 a woman was filmed delivering a racist rant against black people and Poles on the Croydon tram. In January 2014 the English Defence League began targeting an Islamic community centre in Croydon as an “illegal mosque”. In June 2015 a woman had her hijab violently pulled off in a Croydon street. In October that year there was a high-profile immigration raid on Croydon works premises which resulted in seven arrests. Six of those arrested were transferred to detention centres pending their deportation. The immediate responsibility for the recent sickening attack lies with the perpetrators, but a share of responsibility surely also may lie with every media outlet, political organisation and government institution that has fuelled a toxic atmosphere against minorities and asylum seekers. And that includes the last home secretary, Theresa May, who sent her vans with anti-immigrant threats around the streets of areas such as Croydon until they were withdrawn. Even the local Tory MP, Gavin Barwell, welcomed their withdrawal.David RosenbergLondon • On behalf of Young Roots, I want to express how devastated I am about the attack on the young asylum seeker in Croydon on Friday. We are heartbroken by this brutal crime. Many young asylum seekers have fled war, torture and other atrocities. They have survived dangerous journeys here and face loneliness, worries about the rest of their family, and the challenge of navigating the complex immigration system. A large number have post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet the young people we work with in Croydon are a delight. They are bright, warm, friendly and so keen to learn. They are endlessly supportive and kind. Our thoughts are with the victim of this alleged hate crime, and we will continue to work hard to support the young refugee and asylum-seeking community in Croydon to be safe and come to terms with this terrible attack.Jo CobleyDirector, Young Roots – helping young refugees reach their potential • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters

The attack on a teenage asylum seeker in Croydon last Friday comes as reports of abuse directed at refugee children are becoming more frequent, charities and experts have warned. As Reker Ahmed, the 17-year-old Kurdish Iranian who was attacked, recovered in hospital on Monday, those involved in supporting asylum-seeking children expressed dismay at the attack.     Toxic political agenda is dehumanising entire groups, Amnesty warns           Read more       Andy Elvin, chief executive of the fostering organisation Tact, which has looked after hundreds of asylum-seeking children across the country, said he was aware of a number of children in his organisation’s care who had been verbally abused in the streets, and he believed this was a growing problem. “It is verbal abuse – about their status, what they are doing in this country, why they don’t go back,” he said. The organisation runs support groups, advising newly arrived asylum seeking children on how to respond to negative experiences. It was particularly an issue which young people encountered on public transport, he said.  “We have made several reports to the police of hate crimes. We think it is rising. It is entirely linked to the environment that has been created by the public discourse about people coming to this country from overseas ... Asylum seekers are all seen as bogus – not as children, not traumatised, not in need, just freeloaders coming here to take advantage of the system.” Usually the abuse came as a complete surprise to the young people, Elvin added. “They didn’t expect to be targeted in this way. The perception of the UK abroad is still that it is a fair equitable country, where people are treated decently.”  Croydon currently has just over 400 unaccompanied child asylum seekers, a higher number than most local authorities, because it is the location of Lunar House, the government office where people must go to claim asylum.But a council spokesperson said: “This type of incident is extremely rare and our experience has been that the vast majority of young asylum seekers have been welcomed into the community.” Most of the younger child refugees in Croydon and elsewhere are accommodated by the council in foster families, and will go to school in the borough. The older ones, aged 16 or 17, are more likely to be found beds in supported accommodation, and may attend English classes, but will not be in school. Some councils provide acclimatisation sessions for newly arrived refugee children, educating them about British laws, the risks posed by drugs and their personal safety, but often the older arrivals are left largely unsupported to fend for themselves. Liz Clegg, who worked with child asylum seekers in Calais and is now helping child refugees to settle in the UK, said most were entirely unprepared for hostility. “They think: ‘Oh, now we’re in the UK, we’re completely safe.’ They have fled conflict zones and think they have arrived in the promised land; they have a very positive outlook. We have to educate them that there are still serious dangers, that they need to be careful for their personal safety.” Gulwali Passarlay, author of The Lightless Sky, an account of coming to the UK as a lone child asylum seeker from Afghanistan, said that attitudes towards refugees had hardened in recent months.  He highlighted the negative effect of the reporting of the arrival of child refugees from Calais last October (where the ages of the asylum seekers were questioned in some parts of the media), stoking cynicism about child refugees’ asylum claims, and dramatically souring a popular mood of support for child refugees that had followed the drowning of the three-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi in 2015. “The environment has changed. People with rightwing views think it is OK to insult asylum seekers. There are a lot of good people in the UK but the mood is changing. Asylum seekers need to be cautious; it’s not always safe to walk around UK cities,” he said. Josie Naughton, co-founder of Help Refugees, said the attack demonstrated “the level of fear and prejudice which is taking hold of parts of British society”. Rabbi Janet Darley, who works with Citizens UK’s Safe Passage project, which supports unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, said: “This is a sobering reminder of the importance of the need to create a welcoming society, where refugees feel welcomed and accepted.” Donations to a crowd-funding site for the victim had reached over £10,000 by Monday afternoon. Bridie Watson, who launched the fundraising drive, had no personal contact with the victim, but was liaising with the police and social services to make sure the victim received the money. “It was so horrific. We wanted to help people put their shock and love into something positive. We want to show that this is not what the UK is about,” she said.

A white suspect accused of the fatal stabbing of a black man on a Manhattan street has been indicted on a charge of murder as an act of terrorism. James Harris Jackson, 28, appeared briefly in court on Monday and did not speak. Prosecutors had previously also charged him with murder as a hate crime. Jackson’s attorney had no comment.     White veteran 'regarded fatal stabbing of black man as practice for larger attack'           Read more       Jackson is accused of killing Timothy Caughman, 66, a stranger to him. Caughman was attacked from behind last week as he was collecting bottles for recycling. An arraignment on the indictment has been set for 13 April. Speaking with a reporter for the Daily News at New York City’s Rikers Island jail complex, Jackson said he had intended it as “a practice run” in a mission to deter interracial relationships. He said he envisioned a white woman thinking: “Well, if that guy feels so strongly about it, maybe I shouldn’t do it.” Caughman, who was remembered as a gentleman and a good neighbor, was alone when he was attacked from behind with a sword. He staggered, bleeding, into a police station and later died at a hospital. “Tim Caughman did not deserve to die like that,” said Portia Clark, a childhood friend who grew up in Queens and attended the hearing with Caughman’s other friends on Monday. “Nobody does. I mean, come on, we’re black, white, yellow, brown – that’s ridiculous. We’re trying to get along.” Carl Nimmons wept outside court after seeing Jackson. “It really hurt me to see that man, because I can’t do nothing about it. I don’t have the power to do anything about it,” he said. In the Rikers interview, Jackson said in retrospect that he would rather have killed “a young thug” or “a successful older black man with blondes ... people you see in Midtown. These younger guys that put white girls on the wrong path”. He complained that on television, “it’s like every other commercial in the past few years has a mixed-race couple in it”. “The white race is being eroded ... No one cares about you. The Chinese don’t care about you, the blacks don’t care about you,” he said. Jackson, who was raised in what was described as a churchgoing, liberal family in a Baltimore suburb, said his ideal society was “1950s America”. Jackson was in the army from 2009 to 2012 and worked as an intelligence analyst, the army said. Deployed in Afghanistan in 2010 until 2011, he earned several medals and attained the rank of specialist. The military training, Jackson said, helped him plan the bloodshed. “I had been thinking about it for a long time, for the past couple of years,” he said. “I figured I would end up getting shot by police, kill myself, or end up in jail.” His attorney, Sam Talkin, has said if the allegations are anywhere close to being true, “then we’re going to address the obvious psychological issues that are present in this case”.

A white military veteran accused of a hate crime for the stabbing death of a black man in New York regarded the attack as “practice” for a larger assault he hoped to carry out in Times Square, court documents claim. James Jackson, 26, was arrested hours after allegedly stabbing Timothy Caughman to death in Manhattan on Wednesday. According to prosecutors, Jackson, a Maryland resident, traveled to New York for his attack with the intention of killing “as many black men as possible”. “Mr Jackson regarded the killing as practice prior to going to Times Square to kill additional black men,” according to court documents obtained by the New York Daily News. Police investigators said Jackson admitted to the murder during questioning. Prosecutors said Jackson plunged a 2ft sword into the chest of Caughman, a self-described “can and bottle recycler”, as Caughman bent over a trash bin near his home. The 66-year-old, whose social media accounts are full of pictures with celebrities such as Beyoncé and Oprah, managed to stagger into a nearby police station, from which he was transported to a hospital and later died. “The defendant was motivated purely by hatred,” said the assistant district attorney Joan Illuzzi, who added that the charges could be upgraded, “as this was an act most likely of terrorism”. Prosecutors said Jackson hated black men, especially those who dated white women. According to investigators, Jackson, a decorated veteran of the Afghanistan war, had harbored his beliefs for at least a decade – at one point having been recorded on tape stalking black men. Dr Scott Krugman, chairman of pediatrics at Franklin Square medical center in Baltimore and a friend of the Jackson family, said the allegations were out of character with his family’s beliefs and the way he was raised. Jackson’s parents, David and Patricia Jackson, are active members of Towson Presbyterian church and have two other sons. Patricia Jackson is a former teacher of English-language students in the Baltimore County school system and worked for Well for the Journey, a Christian not-for-profit organization that helps people “integrate spirituality into their daily lives in a safe, inclusive space”. “They’re liberal as liberal can be,” Krugman said. “We were at a dinner party with them and everybody was complaining about the current administration and very open about rights for everybody and making sure we’re not excluding immigrants, everything like that. I’m just beyond shocked right now.” In a statement, the Jackson family extended condolences to Caughman’s family and said it was “shocked, horrified and heartbroken by this tragedy”.

A photographer and artist behind a red-triangle warning sign depicting the silhouette of an Orthodox Jewish man has apologised for causing offence after a Jewish neighbourhood watch group reported it as a hate crime. Franck Allais, a freelance photographer, said the contentious sign was part of an artistic project, which includes depictions of a woman pulling a shopping trolley, a man pushing his wheelchair and a cat. Allais said he intended the project to be a comment on identity and that the sign in Stamford Hill, one of the largest Hasidic communities in Europe, was not an antisemitic statement. He said he was left shaken by the offence he had caused. He said: “It was a project about crossing the road … how everyone is different, everyone has an identity. There is not only one sign in the street. I put more signs up in the street, but only this one got noticed. I am sorry for any offence caused.” Shomrim, a Jewish neighbourhood watch group that reported the sign to the Metropolitan police and Hackney council, said earlier it had caused “alarm and distress to local people”. Stamford Hill is at the centre of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish and mainly Hasidic community estimated to number about 30,000 people. Barry Bard, Shomrim’s operational supervisor in the area, said: “The people of Stamford Hill are very sadly used to instances of antisemitic hate crime, but most of those times it will be verbal abuse or even assault. A lot of the time it will be more of a person-to-person kind of thing, or graffiti, which is more unprofessional.” Allais, who has done work for Guardian Weekend, the Saturday and Sunday Telegraph, FT Weekend magazine, the Independent on Sunday, Newsweek and Time Out, said he had created the signs based on real people he saw crossing the road in the areas where the signs were later hung and photographed. Some of the other signs have since been spotted.    Jonathan Savage  (@JSavageTweets) Here's one of the other signs - put up in Egerton Road N16 pic.twitter.com/cnUcs12Xp9  March 15, 2017   Hackney council was expected to remove the Stamford Hill sign on Wednesday. The number of antisemitic incidents in the UK rose by more than a third to record levels in 2016, according to data released by the Community Security Trust. The CST, which monitors antisemitism and provides security to Jewish communities, recorded 1,309 incidents of anti-Jewish hate last year, compared with 960 in 2015, a rise of 36%. The previous peak was in 2014, when 1,182 incidents were recorded.

Crowds who gathered for the funeral of an Indian man killed in an apparently racially motivated shooting in Kansas last week have shouted: “Down with Trump” and held up placards that read: “#DownWithRacism.” Srinivas Kuchibhotla, a 32-year-old aviation engineer, was cremated in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad on Tuesday.  Family members performed the last rites on his body, which had been brought to his home state of Telangana from Kansas on Monday night.  Kuchibhotla’s mother, Parvatha Vardhini, said she would not allow her younger son to return to the US. “I had asked him [Srinivas] to return to India if he was feeling insecure there. But he used to say he was safe and secure,” she said.     Have you seen or been a victim of a hate crime since Trump's election? Tell us           Read more       “Now I want my younger son, Sai Kiran, and his family to come back for good. I will not allow them to go back. My son had gone there in search of a better future. What crime did he commit?” The funeral was held hours after Adam Purinton, 51, a navy veteran, appeared in court in Houston, charged with Kuchibhotla’s murder, the attempted murder of his friend Alok Madasanim and a third man, Ian Grillot, 24, who was wounded when he tried to intervene. Kuchibhotla and Madasanim went to the US to study and worked as engineers at GPS maker, Garmin. Witnesses said Purinton shouted “get out of my country” before opening fire. According to a bartender who called 911, Purinton said he had shot “two Iranian people”.  The FBI is investigating whether the shooting constitutes a hate crime, the maximum sentence for which is death penalty. The incident has raised concerns about the treatment in the US of immigrants, who feel targeted by Donald Trump’s promises to ban certain travellers and build a wall along the Mexico border, and left India and the Indian community in the US in shock. The Telangana American Telugu Association urged its members to speak English in public places. “Much as we love talking in our mother tongue, it can often be misconstrued. Please see if you can communicate in English in public places,” a statement from the organisation said. Last week, Kuchibhotla’s widow, Sunaya Dumala, appealed to the US government to do more to prevent hate crimes. “We’ve read many times in newspapers of some kind of shooting happening. And we always wondered, how safe? I need an answer from the government … What are they going to do?” she said. Hillary Clinton, the losing Democratic candidate in last year’s election, tweeted a link to an article about the shooting and wrote: “With threats & hate crimes on rise, we shouldn’t have to tell @POTUS to do his part. He must step up & speak.” Trump has not commented on the killing. The White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, said last week that linking the death to Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric was “absurd”.

Following one of the most divisive elections in US history, reports have indicated a surge in hate crimes around the country. From acts of antisemitic vandalism and religious discrimination in the workplace to the allegedly targeted shooting of two Indian immigrants and a plot to bomb a refugee community, evidence anecdotally suggests this alarming trend may continue throughout 2017. That’s why Guardian US, along with other major American newsrooms, advocacy groups and academic institutions, is joining the Documenting Hate project. Led by the not-for-profit news organisation ProPublica, Documenting Hate will attempt to better record these instances and provide rigorous analysis, data-driven investigation, and deep reporting on the issue. The federal government keeps a flawed and heavily time-lagged record of hate crimes in the US. Much like its monitoring of the number of people police kill every year, the FBI relies on information supplied voluntarily by the 18,000 police departments around the country, meaning thousands of departments report no data at all, while others may simply not be submitting a complete record. Guardian US is asking readers to submit information, through the form below, if you have witnessed or been the victim of a suspected hate crime, defined by the FBI as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity”.  We would also like to hear from you if you have experienced an incident driven by hatred and prejudice, which may not constitute a crime. Reporters at Guardian US and other news organisations will work to verify submissions and will not share your name and contact information with anyone outside the project. The incidents will be added to a national database of hate crimes and targeted intimidation, which will inform our broader reporting of the issue.

Toxic political rhetoric with echoes of 1930s hate speech is stirring up violence worldwide – including in the UK and US, Amnesty International has warned. Kerry Moscoguiri, Amnesty UK’s director of campaigns, said that campaigning for the Brexit referendum “was a particular low point, with all too real consequences” – pointing to a 57% spike in reported hate crime the week after the vote. She accused the British government of “creating a hostile climate for refugees and migrants” as it shirked its responsibilities to them, particularly unaccompanied children. But the UK was not alone in seeing vicious rhetoric targeting the most vulnerable, as 2016 saw leaders worldwide peddling “the dangerous idea that some people are less human than others”, according to Amnesty’s director of crisis research Tirana Hassan.     FBI reports hate crimes against Muslims surged by 67% in 2015           Read more       She pointed particularly to violence stirred up by Donald Trump, right-wing Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, who called a controversial referendum on refugees, and the Philippines leader Rodrigo Duterte who has launched a war on drugs that has cost thousands of lives. “This report documents the very real human consequences of politicians like Trump, Orbán, Duterte, wielding a toxic agenda that hounds, scapegoats and dehumanises entire groups of people,” Hassan said. The attacks threaten not just human lives but the value system enshrined in international law after the second world war, warned the NGO.  “When language around ‘taking our country back’ and ‘making America great again’ is coupled with proposals to treat EU migrants like bargaining chips or to ban refugees on the grounds of religion, it fosters deep hatred and mistrust and sends a strong message that some people are entitled to human rights and others aren’t,” said Kate Allen, Director of Amnesty International UK. “Have we forgotten that human rights protections were created after the mass atrocities of the second world war as a way of making sure that ‘never again’ actually meant ‘never again’?”     Politicians fuelled rise in hate crimes after Brexit vote, says UN body           Read more       It was a year filled with contempt for those ideals, Amnesty warned, from the almost “routine” bombing of hospitals in Syria and Yemen, to violent suppression of dissent and attacks on refugees and migrants.  Worldwide, 36 countries broke international law and forced refugees back into conflict zones or places where their rights were at risk, it said.  The report was particularly damning of the failure to halt the brutal bombing of rebel-held east Aleppo, in the final stages of a Russian-backed campaign, when chemical weapons and bunker-buster bombs were used against civilians. That inaction “called to mind similar failures in Rwanda and Srebrenica in 1994 and 1995”, the report said, and was a damning indictment of major powers and the UN, paralysed by their rivalries as civilians suffered. “Never have these failures been as apparent as in December 2016, when we all witnessed the graphic and brutal bombardment of Aleppo, when war crimes were essentially beamed into our living rooms,” Moscogiuri said.                Facebook        Twitter        Pinterest         The far right in Britain - video explainer    The British government is criticised in the report for stepping up digital surveillance with the new “snooper’s charter”, which allows the state disturbing access to private lives of its citizens. “By introducing one of the broadest regimes for mass surveillance of any country in the world, the UK took a significant step towards a reality where the right to privacy is simply not recognised,” the report said. It was not all bleak. Amnesty also noted how fierce repression had inspired courage and resistance around the world, from the people of the Gambia who threw off 22 years off dictatorship in a peaceful election, to the Olympic protest of Ethiopian marathon medallist Feyisa Lilesa, and the young “clown of Aleppo”. Lilesa drew attention to the struggles of his Oromo tribe by crossing his arms over his head as he reached the finish line, a gesture of defiance that could potentially have cost him the medal.  The 24-year-old entertainer Anas al-Basha chose to stay in besieged Aleppo to bring some distraction and relief to its children, and died there in an airstrike in December. “Ultimately, the charge that human rights is a project of the elite rings hollow,” the report said. “People’s instincts for freedom and justice do not simply wither away.”

The number of antisemitic incidents in the UK rose by more than a third to record levels in 2016, according to data released by the Community Security Trust. The CST, which monitors antisemitism and provides security to Jewish communities, recorded 1,309 incidents of anti-Jewish hate last year, compared with 960 in 2015, a rise of 36%. The previous record number of incidents was in 2014, when 1,182 were recorded.     How are you tackling antisemitism on social media? Share your stories           Read more       The CST’s chief executive, David Delew, said: “While Jewish life in this country remains overwhelmingly positive, this heightened level of antisemitism is deeply worrying and appears to be getting worse. Worst of all is that, for various reasons, some people clearly feel more confident to express their antisemitism publicly than they did in the past.” The 2014 spike in incidents was attributed to the war in Gaza, deemed to be a “trigger event”. However no such trigger was identified for 2016. Instead, the CST said, there may have been a “cumulative effect of a series of events and factors that, taken together, have created an atmosphere in which more antisemitic incidents are occurring”. The factors included terrorist attacks in Europe, high profile allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party and a perceived increase in racism and xenophobia following the Brexit referendum, as well as the 2014 Gaza war. The 1,309 antisemitic incidents recorded in 2016 included 107 violent assaults, up 29% on the previous year; 65 incidents of damage and desecration to Jewish property; and 1,006 incidents of abusive behaviour, including verbal abuse, graffiti and on social media. Social media had become “an essential tool for coordinated campaigns of antisemitic harassment, abuse and threats directed at Jewish politicians, student activists and other individuals, perpetrated by transnational networks of online antisemitic activists, some of whom are involved in extremist politics,” the CST said. Over three-quarters of incidents were recorded in Greater London and Greater Manchester, where the majority of British Jews live. Greater London saw a 65% increase incidents on the previous year. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the government would continue “to do all we can to stamp out these vile attacks and encourage those who experience them to come forward”. Antisemitism was “a deplorable form of hatred that has absolutely no place in a tolerant, open and diverse Britain that works for everyone”. Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, said the CST’s findings were “extremely distressing”. He added: “I don’t want to live in a country where any member of the Jewish community feels unsafe, afraid or discriminated against … We must root out antisemitism whenever it takes place and wherever it exists, as a party and a country.”

Pakistan’s television regulator has banned a well-known talkshow host for hate speech, after he hosted shows accusing liberal activists and others of blasphemy, an inflammatory allegation that could put their lives at risk.  Blasphemy is a criminal offence in Muslim-majority Pakistan that can result in the death penalty. Even being accused of blasphemy can provoke targeted acts of violence by religious rightwing vigilantes.  Aamir Liaquat Hussain, who describes his programme aired on Bol TV as the country’s leading television show, had been at the forefront of a campaign to discredit liberal activists who went missing this month, as well as those defending them. In a document sent to Bol TV and seen by Reuters, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority said Liaquat’s show “wilfully and repeatedly made statements and allegations which (are) tantamount to hate speech, derogatory remarks, incitement to violence against citizens and casting accusations of being anti-state and anti-Islam.”  Liaquat did not answer calls to his mobile telephone on Thursday and representatives of Bol TV were not immediately available for comment.  He had blamed several prominent Pakistanis for an anti-state agenda and being either sympathetic to, or directly involved in, blasphemy against Islam’s founder, the prophet Muhammad.  In 2011, the governor of Punjab province, Salman Taseer, was assassinated by one of his bodyguards after he called for reform of the country’s blasphemy laws.

At least 65 others have been murdered over blasphemy allegations since 1990, according to figures from the Center for Research and Security Studies thinktank and media.  Liaquat, famous for combining religion and gameshows, has often courted controversy. He once gave away abandoned babies during a broadcast and caused uproar by airing vitriolic hate speech against the Ahmadi minority.  One of the targets of Liaquat’s show was activist lawyer Jibran Nasir, who filed a police complaint under Pakistan’s anti-terrorism law on Thursday charging him with “running a defamatory and life-threatening campaign”.  Classical dancer Sheema Kirmani received death threats after Liaquat targeted her on his 19 January broadcast.  Classical dance was banned and associated with obscenity under the regime of military dictator Zia ul Haq, who pushed for greater “Islamisation” of Pakistan in the 1980s.  The situation is potentially worse now than during the Zia era, Kirmani said. “Previously the government could close the auditorium, or arrest you, but now anyone sitting in the audience can decide ‘I am not going to allow this.’”

The mayor of London has urged a zero tolerance attitude to hate crimes in the capital as he met genocide survivors.  Sadiq Khan said the city remained inclusive and global, following four antisemitic attacks over the weekend. He made the remarks as he met genocide survivors at City Hall at the first in a series of events in the lead-up to Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January. A spokesperson for Scotland Yard said on Sunday that officers were investigating four hate crime allegations aimed towards north London’s Jewish community.  Speaking after Monday’s event, Khan said: “I ask all Londoners to report any form of hate crime, no matter how trivial. A brick with a swastika on it thrown through a window of a Jewish home is not a trivial matter and needs to be addressed.” The other incidents being probed by police include a woman having eggs thrown at her by the occupants of a passing car and offensive graffiti, including a swastika.  The mayor met several people who survived periods of mass murder, including a second world war Holocaust survivor, Mala Tribich, and Sokpal Din, who lived through the Cambodian genocide.  This year’s theme for the memorial is “how can life go on?” aiming to highlight the difficulties faced by survivors.  Tribich, who was 12 when the Germans invaded her Polish home town, described how she lost most of her family and suffered a severe illness in the concentration camps. She told the audience: “Living a normal life is the biggest challenge for Holocaust survivors.” Din gave a message of hope, saying: “The only thing we had was hope and that was something I never gave up on.”

Britain should prepare for a fresh spike in hate crimes against EU citizens when the article 50 process triggering Brexit begins, the human rights watchdog has said. David Isaac, chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), told a hearing of MPs he was worried the start of formally leaving the bloc could cause a backlash against EU citizens, similar to the period of increased hate crime that followed the EU referendum, and was calling on police to be prepared for such an eventuality. Theresa May has promised to trigger article 50 before the end of March but it could come earlier than that now she has set out her plans to leave the single market in order to secure immigration controls and remove the UK from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.      Poles in UK fear spike in hate crimes when Brexit process begins           Read more       The government is now awaiting the outcome of a supreme court decision about whether parliament will have to pass an act approving Brexit before it can go ahead. Ahead of that ruling, Isaac told MPs on the women and equalities committee that the EHRC was “hugely concerned about what might happen in relation to an increase in hate crime” when article 50 is triggered.  “And so, to give you examples of what we are seeking to do, we are meeting with groups, we are seeking to ensure that there is as much police protection and understanding in relation to hate crimes as is possible,” he said. “And, I think, given our role, I believe, we are uniquely placed to be doing all of this at a time when Britain needs guidance in relation to huge anxiety that resides, not just in relation to non-UK citizens and our visitors, but actually many of our own citizens.”  Highlighting the rise in hate crime over the summer, he said: “One of the things that concerns us greatly is the position in relation to the spike in hate crimes since 23 June. I’ve met with the Polish ambassador, my opposite number in Poland, because of the large number of attacks against the Polish community, but I am also in touch with various other groups.”  The prime minister’s spokeswoman said the government would “certainly not want” a surge in hate crimes, when asked if May shared Isaac’s concerns. “The prime minister has taken a very strong and clear stance on our commitment to continuing to be an open and tolerant nation and to stamp out hate crime wherever it exists,” she said. “What is important is the approach we have taken of consistently and repeatedly saying that hate crime is completely unacceptable, and that the outcome of the referendum was not a vote to become inward-looking and to stop being an open and tolerant nation. We will continue to champion those values and stand up for them.” Joanna Mludzinska, a Polish community leader, warned last week that a “wave” of hate crimes against European migrants could follow the start of Britain’s exit from the EU. The chair of the Polish Social and Cultural Association told MPs on the Commons home affairs committee that triggering article 50 could act as a “flashpoint” for new xenophobic attacks. Mludzinska said: “Where those people who for whatever reason thought everything would be resolved by Brexit find that doesn’t miraculously happen ... there might be another wave of response... ‘Why aren’t we getting what we wanted, and why are they still here?’” At the hearing, Yvette Cooper, the committee’s chair, said details of hate crime incidents heard by her committee were appalling. “Hate crime is appalling, un-British and should have no place in our country,” she said.

A speech about foreign workers given by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, at the Tory party conference in October has been officially recorded as a hate incident, police have confirmed. Rudd said in her speech that she wanted to make it harder for British companies to employ migrants and to ensure foreign workers “were not taking jobs British workers could do”. The speech was followed by a background briefing by an aide who suggested firms could be required to publish lists of foreign workers. Rudd herself confirmed the next day that such lists were an option, but the idea was quickly dropped.     When the Tories talk about curbs on foreign workers, they don’t mean me. Or do they?           Read more       Media coverage of the speech so alarmed an Oxford University physics professor, Joshua Silver, that he complained to the police. “I felt politicians have been using hate speech to turn Britons against foreigners, and I thought that is probably not lawful,” he told the Times. His complaint was dealt with by West Midlands police as the Tory conference took place in Birmingham.  National police reporting rules introduced in 2014 and endorsed by Rudd herself require all complaints of hate crime incidents to be recorded “regardless of whether or not those making the complaint are the victim and irrespective of whether or not there is any evidence to identify the hate crime incident”. West Midlands police have now written to the professor saying they have concluded an assessment of his complaint and they will not be investigating Rudd’s speech as a hate crime. “The matter has been recorded in line with the National Police Chiefs’ Council manual as a non-crime hate incident,” the force told the professor. A Home Office spokesperson said: “This was not a hate crime. The home secretary has been crystal clear that hatred has absolutely no place in a Britain that works for everyone. She’s made countering hate one of her key priorities; indeed, one of the first public interventions she made was to launch the hate crime action plan.” The policy of blanket recording of all complaints of hate crime incidents was drawn up by the College of Policing in 2014 with the justification that increased reporting would help police to tackle hate crime more effectively.

Poles and other eastern Europeans living in Britain fear there will be a fresh spike in hate crime when the Brexit process is formally triggered before the end of March, MPs have been told. Polish community leaders told the Commons home affairs committee that since the EU referendum a small minority of people in Britain had been emboldened to launch verbal and physical attacks against migrants in public places, at work and in schools. “Every statement and every political activity around Brexit negotiations brings a spike in inquiries to our organisation. We expect when article 50 is triggered it will bring another level of discontent,” Barbara Drozdowicz, of the East European Resource Centre, told the MPs. Police figures show reports of hate crime rose by 46% in the immediate aftermath of the vote last June and a second spike occurred in the last week of July, before incidences settled back to a weekly level 16% above those seen in 2015. Community leaders say complaints to the police receive a mixed response and some schools turn a blind eye to incidents on their premises. Joanna Mludzinska, chair of the Polish Social and Cultural Association, told MPs of her shock when her west London cultural centre was covered in graffiti, and said only a government guarantee on the post-Brexit status of the 3 million EU nationals in Britain would give them the confidence to reply to such attacks. Tadeusz Stenzel, the chair of trustees at the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, said of those responsible for the attacks: “They feel there is a less of a brake on them and they think if the people involved are migrants it is not a racist situation.” Drozdowicz said her resource centre had experienced an “explosion of calls” since the referendum result. She said there were incidents of teams of Polish construction workers being told to “go home”. A mother with a child in a buggy in the street had been told to “take your Polish bastard back home”. In a secondary school in west London, teachers had seen a Polish boy being beaten and had failed to respond. When his mother had complained to the school she was told that if he had been black it would have been treated as a racist incident. Drozdowicz said not all police forces were ready to respond to those who wanted to report hate crime. “They are sometimes waved away as employment issues about discrimination. Others are told that if they do not speak fluent English they are partially to blame for what happened,” she said. Drozdowicz said the pace of change had been too much for some communities, and people were turning on their neighbours. She said integration policies were not yet in place to help them respond, with east European communities often regarded as a problem rather than an asset. She stressed that hate crime victims were more likely to be poor east Europeans who were working in low-skilled jobs rather than middle-class professionals such as doctors, managers and lawyers. Yvette Cooper, the committee’s chair, said the details of hate crime incidents they had heard were appalling. “Hate crime is appalling, unBritish and should have no place in our country,” she said.

A man who made antisemitic death threats to a Labour MP has admitted further charges after sending abusive messages on Twitter. John Nimmo, 28, from South Shields, sent two emails to Luciana Berger in which he said she would “get it like Jo Cox” and “watch your back Jewish scum”. The second message to the MP for Liverpool Wavertree included a picture of a large knife and came just three weeks after MP Jo Cox was killed. In a separate incident he also admitted sending offensive emails to an anti-hate crime organisation including threatening to blow up a mosque. Newcastle crown court heard the three further charges related to tweets he sent that included messaging someone saying, “watch your back you Jewish inbred you’re dead meat, National Action”. Berger, the former shadow minister for mental health, said the messages had caused her “great fear and anguish”. She said the incident had left her in a state of “huge distress” and “it caused me to feel physically sick being threatened in such a way”. “I was extremely concerned for my safety and I felt completely under threat. I had previously received antisemitic messages and threats but the reference to Jo Cox was terrifying,” she said. “The biggest concern was not knowing who this was, for all I knew the offender could have resided next door to me.” Nimmo was jailed in 2014 for eight weeks for sending abusive messages on Twitter to feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and MP Stella Creasy. It came after Criado-Perez led a campaign using social media for a female figure to appear on a Bank of England note. It included Nimmo telling Criado-Perez to “shut up” and made references to rape followed by: “I will find you (smiley face)”. Nimmo was remanded in custody and told he would be sentenced for all three cases on 10 February.

Poles living in Britain are so anxious about their right to remain after Brexit that they are failing to report hate crimes, according to the head of the Polish Social and Cultural Association. Joanna Młudzińska, who will give evidence on Tuesday to a home affairs select committee inquiry on the issue, said EU nationals felt so disenfranchised at being used as “pawns” in Brexit negotiations that they were opting to keep a low profile, rather than contact the authorities. The situation has become so acute that the London-based East European Resource Centre (EERC) is launching a pilot scheme to encourage EU nationals to report hate crimes. Młudzińska, who was born in London to Polish parents, said the government’s failure to clarify the standing of the UK’s 2.9 million EU citizens was “immoral” and was putting Polish and other EU migrants living in Britain in an impossible position. “Very few people are reporting hate crimes at the moment. People are very scared, because often this occurs in the workplace and they are scared they might lose their job. Or it’s from a neighbour and they don’t want to cause more problems.” Młudzińska added: “They can’t turn around and say: ‘No, I don’t have to go home because your government has said I am allowed to stay.’ That puts you in a weaker position, doesn’t it? It makes people vulnerable. It makes them scared to stand up for themselves, to properly report things.” Last year the number of Polish-born UK residents was estimated at 831,000, making Poles the largest overseas-born group in the country and Polish the second most spoken language in England. Various agencies have documented that incidents of hate crime soared in the aftermath of June’s EU referendum vote. On Friday, a 15-year-old boy appeared in Chelmsford youth court charged with the manslaughter of a Polish man who was attacked in Essex weeks after the UK voted to leave the EU. The death of Arkadiusz Jóźwik, 40, in Harlow was initially reported as a possible hate crime, becoming one of the most high-profile incidents of violence linked to the result of the EU referendum, although it is understood that prosecutors are not treating it as such. A number of sources recorded an increase in hate crime in the wake of the Brexit vote. Racist or religious abuse incidents recorded by police in England and Wales jumped 41% with 5,468 such crimes being logged in the month after the UK voted to quit the EU, according to the Home Office. The uncertainty facing EU nationals living in Britain has been highlighted by a series of cases, including that of Dom Wolf, born in London to German parents, who told the Guardian on Thursday that he could not get a British passport unless he took a UK citizenship test because he could not prove his mother had been in England legally when she gave birth to him. The 32-year-old said he felt betrayed by the country in which he was born. His parents arrived in 1974, when his mother worked for the University of London as a lecturer and his father was self-employed. Other examples include Monique Hawkins, a Dutch woman who has lived in the UK for 24 years and has two children with her British husband, but has been told by the Home Office that she should make arrangements to leave the country after applying for citizenship. Professor Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics at the University of Kent, said that, despite the apparent rise in hate crimes following the referendum, there were inherent difficulties in quantifying the issue. “The police measures for recording hate crime and how it is categorised have only recently become more sophisticated, so we’re not really able to say whether things are actually getting worse or better,” he said. “Historically, it’s been an area where we haven’t really invested much.” Goodwin, who will also appear before the select committee hearing, said that monitoring the far right was problematic because easily identifiable organisations, such as the EDL and BNP, had fractured into small, disparate factions. “This has made it harder for researchers, as well as the security services, to keep on top. There are 20 tiny groups and it’s quite difficult to know what they are doing and how,” he said.

Are we the nation suggested by the 41% spike in hate crimes that followed the Brexit vote? Where non-white Britons are abused in the street and people harangued for wearing the wrong clothes or presuming that they might speak in anything but English? Where Nadiya Hussain’s popularity after winning The Great British Bake Off could not save her from being confronted by the boor on a train who declared “I ain’t sitting near a Muslim”? Where women wearing the hijab are attacked in the street. Where a dark-skinned woman exercising her constitutional legal right to challenge the executive is threatened and bullied by assailants who tell her – not that she may be wrong – but that she should leave the country? It feels close to that now. The spike has fallen from its peak; still equilibrium seems distant: the air seems toxic.     Wartime Britain’s welcome for black GIs was complicated | Letters           Read more       And what is extraordinary is that no one in any position of power and authority is doing anything meaningful about it. Were the markets careering out of control, the chancellor would be touring television and radio stations trying to calm them. Were there to be a terrorist atrocity, the prime minister would rush to the scene. The procedures for dealing with these big-ticket emergencies are well established. Not so the procedure for reacting to a dramatic erosion in the social glue. There is little by way of leadership from No 10. Nothing from the communities secretary to suggest his title is anything other than honorific. There was a statement from Robert Buckland, the solicitor general, declaring saying that levels of hate crimes – 2,778 incidents between 5 and 18 August – had declined to 2015 levels. Some reassurance. In the year to 2015, hate crimes, at 52,000 offences, had jumped more than a fifth.

All the more so because this acridity is not a given. We’re cranky now, with the handbrake off and inhibitions released, but at times more tense and fearful in our history we have been more willing to show kindness to people of difference. We have been better than this.     Wartime Britain and black GIs united through music | Letters           Read more       Recently published in the UK is Forgotten: The Untold Story of D-Day’s Black Heroes, first released in the US, about the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion, an 800-strong unit of black American soldiers whose contribution to the D-day landings had all but been erased from history. After landing on the beaches, they deployed armed balloons and deterred enemy aircraft – a task for which they largely prepared over seven months in the British countryside, having docked in the north of Scotland. Before the arrival of the Empire Windrush and the advent of mass immigration, there was an influx of foreigners at a speed and on a scale to give Nigel Farage a coronary. They were soldiers during wartime, so of course they were met with gratitude, you might say; but the point is more specific for in the era of savagely enforced segregation in the US, white GIs showed a brutal and racist disdain for black GIs posted alongside them in Britain. And the British government, to curry favour with white, predominantly southern soldiers – and a like-minded US military establishment – offered the black GIs scant protection. Author Linda Hervieux located 12 of them, and the most striking thing they recall is the extraordinary extent to which ordinary British people – themselves deprived in a time of penury and rations – were their tigerish supporters, protectors and cheerleaders.        When white GIs objected to black GIs at a village dance, they themselves were ordered to leave        Ollie Stewart, a black American journalist, who reported on the deployment of 1,300 black soldiers to Britain, noted: “The English people show our lads every possible courtesy and some of them, accustomed to ill-will, harsh words and artificial barriers, seem slightly bewildered. They never had a chance to leave their southern homes before and never realised there was a part of the world which was willing to forget a man’s colour and welcome him as a brother.” Arthur Guest, a member of the battalion, recalled: “It was a spark of light. A different way of living.” Hervieux records their billeting in places such as Checkendon, Oxfordshire, Pontypool and Chepstow. “Working-class people in the Welsh villages shared their meagre rations and the yield of their small kitchen gardens. Here they were Americans first.” Compare and contrast. A few weeks ago, I spoke to a Romanian, a driver, who said he has become wary of asking for directions because of abuse triggered by his accent. And the worst place for that in his recent experience? Genteel Tunbridge Wells. We can compare the arrogance of those who bully and smear foreigners now with those who did so years ago; with the white GIs who spread rumours that some of the black soldiers – even the college educated – could only bark and many had tails. We can compare the indolence of our government now with that of Churchill back then. We don’t “want to see lynching begin in England”, noted an aide to Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary. But when Churchill was told of a black GI being hounded from a restaurant by white colleagues, he suggested the soldier acquire a banjo and seek entry as a member of the band.     National anti-hate crime campaign to launch after spike in incidents           Read more       Ordinary people, however, saw things differently. When a vicar’s wife from Somerset urged separatism, she was castigated. “There is and will be no persecution of coloured people in Britain,” thundered the Sunday Pictorial. When white GIs objected to black GIs at a village dance, they themselves were ordered to leave. To drive home the point, local people taunted the expelled GIs by buying the their black guests drinks. George Orwell, as ever, reflected the grassroots mood. “The general consensus of opinion seems to be that the only American soldiers with any manners are the Negroes,” he wrote in Tribune. Of course, the comparison is inexact. There is a difference between an influx of soldiers deployed during wartime and the modern examples of difference: Britons who look, speak and dress differently, economic migrants whose presence undoubtedly has an impact on schools, hospitals, jobs and housing. Those who bully and abuse can seek to justify their behaviour by pointing to the stresses that we know exist. Still there is something to be gleaned from the experience of the black battalion. They were not “othered” as dehumanised symbols, even when their presence caused debate and tension. They were seen as flesh and blood individuals. Jessie Prior, a Welsh woman who had never seen a non-white person before, sent a letter to New Jersey, to the mother of a black GI her family had befriended. “While he is here, we shall take every care of him,” she said. “We look upon him now as our own.” There are modern versions of her in every community. We should be proud of them, but it’s those who preach division who hog the limelight. With every racist act, every catcall, every rancid tweet, they betray Prior and all like her who once set a higher standard. We have been better than this, and can be again.

I was shocked by the letter (17 December) from Tony Greenstein and others about the government adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism. The letter said: “The new definition has nothing to do with opposing antisemitism, it is merely designed to silence public debate on Israel’s crimes against the Palestinians. Antisemitic incidents comprise about 2% of all hate crime. Why then the concentration on antisemitism and not on Islamophobia, which is far more widespread?” Those assertions are all either misleading or false and seem to say that antisemitism in Britain doesn’t matter. It is true that religiously based hate crime represents a very small percentage of all hate crime. In 2015 out of about 66,000 hate crimes in the UK, about 5,000 were on grounds of religion and, of those, about 1,000 attacks each were antisemitic and Islamophobic. Both types of attack are as abhorrent as each other. The British Jewish population is less than 10% of the size of the British Muslim population, so the Jewish community is facing far more frequent racist attacks pro rata than the Muslim community. In fact, the attacks on the Jewish community are concentrated on those who are easily identified as being Jewish, including those going to or from Jewish community centres, events or synagogues. Secular Jews are frequently unaware of such attacks. The new definition of antisemitism that the government has adopted specifically states that “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic”. It does, however, define “applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation” as antisemitic. Is that what they want to do? There is nothing in the new definition that would stifle legitimate criticism of Israel. When unjustified criticism of Israel is published in the media, such as the false report of a massacre in Jenin, antisemitic attacks in the UK increase, so this new definition is needed. Islamophobia does not increase in response to reports of the Israel-Palestine dispute. It does increase in response to reports of jihadi attacks in the west. That is also unfair on Muslims in Britain who are strongly opposed to terrorism. But it is no reason to make light of antisemitism in Britain.Stephen FranklinLondon • Deplorable though the Netanyahu government’s settlement policy is, the description by the usual pro-BDS suspects of Israel as “an apartheid state” is ludicrous. This is a country whose minority Arab citizens have, and exercise, the vote, are represented in the Knesset, local government, the judiciary, academia and the press, and whose religion, whether Muslim or Christian, is freely practised. That is not to say more does not need to be done to enhance provision for Israel’s Arab citizens, especially the Bedouin, but it would be a welcome change if those who constantly denounce Israel for failings real, exaggerated or imagined spent a fraction of their energy protesting about the slaughter in Syria, many of whose citizens are being treated in Israeli hospitals, or the actions of Hamas and Hezbollah.Jeremy BeechamLabour, House of Lords • My question to the letter’s signatories is simple: how many of you have actually visited Israel? If you have had any kind of in-depth visit to Israel, you must have noticed how many Arabs study at its universities. How many of the doctors and teachers are Arab. How many checkout staff in the supermarkets are Arab, working side by side with Israelis. Do you see separate seating on buses and in public places for Arabs and non-Arabs? No. That is what apartheid was, and it is not practised in any shape or form in Israel.Ann LevinRa’anana, Israel • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters

Germany is to consider new laws that would force social media platforms such as Facebook and search engines such as Google to take a more active role in policing illegal hate speech on their sites. Measures considered by Angela Merkel’s coalition government include forcing companies to set up clear channels for registering complaints, to publish the number of complaints they receive and to hire legally qualified ombudsmen to carry out deletions.     Facebook's plan to tackle fake news raises questions over limitations           Read more       Online platforms that fail meet such legal requirements could be hit with fines calculated on the basis of their global annual turnover, or face on-the-spot fines of up to €500,000 if they neglect to remove posts in breach of German hate speech law within 24 hours. Concerns over social media’s power to fire up populist narratives and boost conspiracy theories has increased after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump’s shock election in November, with politicians across Europe looking anxiously ahead to elections in France and Germany next year. In Germany, which has some of the toughest laws around hate speech – including prison sentences for Holocaust denial and inciting hatred against minorities – political frustration with tech companies’ refusal to take responsibility for content posted on their sites has increased markedly in recent months. A hate speech taskforce including representatives from Google, Facebook and Twitter, set up by German justice minister Heiko Maas in autumn 2015, vowed to aim to delete illegal postings within 24 hours. But a government report published in late September this year found that tech companies were still struggling to react adequately to breaches of law, with Facebook only deleting 46%, YouTube 10% and Twitter 1% of illegal content flagged up by normal, non-privileged users. According to a investigation by Süddeutsche Zeitung, Facebook currently employs about 600 people via the service provider Arvato to each carry out 2,000 deletions per day on its German-language accounts. But German officials say they have received no such information from the tech companies themselves. If another report due at the start of next year showed no further improvement, the German government would take steps towards sanctioning companies, Maas told The Observer. “We are already looking in detail at how we can make providers of online platforms criminally liable for undeleted content that breaks German law. Of course, if other measures don’t work we also need to think about fines. That would be a strong incentive for quick action.” While German law currently sets an upper limit of €10 million for the amount companies can be fined for criminal offences, the justice ministry is independently looking into whether fines in the future can be calculated on the basis of a company’s global annual turnover. “We urgently need more transparency,” said Maas, a member of the centre-left Social Democratic party. “We could imagine obliging social networks to publish at regular intervals how many complaints they have received about illegal hate speech and how they dealt with them. That way it would be visible for everyone how many complaints there are and how many deletions. That too would increase the pressure on Facebook, Twitter, Google and others. “Companies that make money with their social networks have social obligations – it cannot be in any company’s interest that their platform is used to commit crimes”, he said. While the debate in Germany has mostly focused on postings on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, such law changes would also have wide-ranging consequences for the Google search engine. Last Sunday, an Observer article pointed out that the top Google search result for the question “Did the Holocaust happen” linked to an article on a neo-Nazi website. While typing the same question in German into German Google does not yield this link, the first page of results still includes links to Holocaust-denial articles. According to Christian Solmecke, a Cologne lawyer specialising in hate-speech offences, such statements are “unequivocally” covered by section 130, paragraph 3 of the German criminal code, which states that “whosoever publicly or in a meeting approves of, denies or downplays an act committed under the rule of National Socialism [...] in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding five years or a fine.” While Google does not have to seek out illegal content out of its own accord, it has to react to any complaint, whether by deletion or by blocking access, Solmecke said: “According to German law, a complaint would immediately oblige Google to delete such content and avoid a future repeat of such a violation”. Unlike the three social media sites at the heart of the German government’s current investigation – Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned Youtube – the search engine itself does not offer a prominently displayed channel for lodging complaints, such as Facebook’s abuse button. A “send feedback” window at the bottom of Google’s search page allows ordinary users to message the search engine, but since there is no separate field for contact details, the process is a one-way street. The Guardian used the feedback box to Google about a link to a website by Ursula Haverbeck – a prominent German holocaust denier who has been repeatedly sent to prison under the incitement of hatred law – but the website was still listed as one of the engine’s top search results 24 hours later. Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called on Google and other tech companies to take a more active role in stopping the spread of hate speech online. “Websites that deny the Holocaust, stoke antisemitism and resentments against minorities, or spread other inhuman messages, are completely unacceptable”, Schuster said.
