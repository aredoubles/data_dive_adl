NHS workers will have had their pay cut by 12% by the end of the decade because of a government-imposed wage restraint that is now exacerbating chronic understaffing, new research reveals. The 625,000 health service staff who earn at least £22,000 will have seen their income fall by 12% between 2010-11 and 2020-21 as a result of years of below-inflation 0% and 1% pay rises eroding their spending power, according to a report by the Health Foundation thinktank The real-terms drop in pay will hit NHS personnel across the UK who are on band five or above in the service’s pay scales, which includes all 315,000 nurses. The Royal College of Nursing’s 270,000 members are currently being polled on whether they should strike – for the first time in their history – in protest at the government holding down their pay by limiting rises to 1% every year until 2020. Staff salaries have already been cut by 6% since the coalition came to power in 2010, more than the 2% seen across the economy as a whole in that time, the report found. Midwives have seen their pay shrink by 6%, but doctors and health visitors have been hit by 8% and 12% drops respectively. The Health Foundation also found that England could face a shortfall of 42,000 nurses by 2020, and almost half of all nurses believe that current staffing levels are already dangerously stretched. Staff pay has fallen back so much that it is now causing major problems, the thinktank said. “The current phase of national NHS pay bill control began at a time of economic recession, with low inflation and high unemployment. However, this is increasingly being replaced by greater numbers of staff shortages and the likelihood of higher inflation.” It adds: “Having contained NHS staff earnings growth in recent years, UK governments now face a situation where recent trends and future projections highlight that earnings in the broader economy are growing more rapidly, and inflation is at a level that will erode the purchasing power of NHS staff.”                                Facebook        Twitter        Pinterest         Thousands of nurses are projected to leave the profession. Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Observer   NHS pay caps have gone as far as they can, but are no longer sustainable and should be replaced, argued the thinktank: “The need for staffing growth, internal skills shortages, the search for productivity improvements, the ageing of the NHS workforce, and external labour market changes and unknowns – for example, the impact of Brexit on NHS staffing – all point to the need to better align the total reward package of NHS staff with organisational priorities.” The likelihood of inflation being around 2-3% and workers generally receiving 3% pay rises means NHS staff’s earnings will continue to decline, the thinktank believes. “This means that NHS pay is likely to continue to reduce relative to both inflation and the wider economy over the period. Health unions said the findings vindicated their warnings that wage control had been applied for so long that it was prompting staff to quit and potential recruits to choose to pursue other careers. “Nurses should not have to fund the NHS deficit from their own pay packets. Every year that the government holds NHS pay below inflation, hundreds of thousands of nurses get another real-terms cut to their salary. Too many are struggling to make ends meet, turning to food banks and hardship grants in desperation,” said Janet Davies, the RCN’s chief executive and general secretary. The government pay cap is fuelling a recruitment and retention crisis that is also damaging patient care, she said. “A growing number feel they can no longer afford to work in the profession and others are deterred from joining by the meagre pay on offer.” She called on Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, to scrap the 1% pay cap that the government has already said it intends to impose on public-sector workers until 2020. The NHS has about 25,000 nursing vacancies lying unfilled across the UK, especially in hospitals, the RCN estimates.     Brexit could make NHS shortage of nurses worse, says report           Read more       Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation, said: “By 2019, people working for the NHS will have had their pay capped for nine consecutive years. The result is that earnings will have fallen by at least 12% over a decade when accounting for inflation. The NHS doesn’t have enough nurses and is struggling to retain staff. As earnings across the economy pick up, the government can’t continue to hold down pay indefinitely and secure the workforce the NHS needs.” The Conservatives dismissed the findings. “We disagree with these figures. They speculate on future pay awards, which are based on independent recommendations. Investment in our NHS, in additional staff and indeed in their overall pay is founded on the strong economy only Theresa May and the Conservatives can provide,” a party spokesman said.

Theresa May has fuelled accusations she has been “hiding from the public” during the general election campaign after she held her latest rally in a tiny community hall in the depths of a forest with such poor phone reception that live coverage of the event was impossible. About 200 Conservative campaigners crammed into Crathes town hall, a tin-roofed single-storey building at the heart of a swath of woodland in rural north-east Scotland, from where journalists were unable to tweet or broadcast. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, was quick to make political capital of the event on Twitter:    John McDonnell MP  (@johnmcdonnellMP) Been out all day on the campaign trail in Mansfield. Can someone please explain to me why our Prime Minister is hiding in a forest? https://t.co/Yj5bscvn6x  April 29, 2017   The prime minister has come under fire in recent days for supposedly dodging any chance of unscripted encounters with members of the public. After she delivered a speech in a community centre in Leeds to a select group of supporters rather than the users of the building on Friday, Jeremy Corbyn accused her of hiding from the public. “She won’t take part in TV debates and she won’t talk to voters,” Corbyn said. “Refusing to debate Labour in this election isn’t a sign of strength, it’s a sign of weakness. What is she afraid of? Voters deserve to know what political parties are offering.” When journalists were eventually able to report on May’s speech it emerged she had told her supporters that she was the only leader capable of providing “strong and stable leadership” for Britain as the country headed towards Brexit. “At this election, people will have a clear choice between five years of strong and stable leadership with me and my team or a coalition of chaos led by Jeremy Corbyn,” she said. “That’s what’s on offer of course, if you look at the other parties, they’re lining up to prop up Jeremy Corbyn. We see it from the Liberal Democrats and we see it from Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists.” Aberdeenshire was one of the most strongly pro-union regions of Scotland in the independence referendum with a yes vote of over 60%. Reminding her supporters of the potential of another independence vote in the near future, she said: “There is only one party that is committed to the union. There is only one candidate for prime minister who will stand up to defend the United Kingdom.” May said she would strengthen the union by “standing up against the separatists who want to break up our country”.  Asking voters in Scotland to back her vision for a post-Brexit Britain she said: “Give me the mandate to lead Britain, give me the mandate to speak for Britain, give me the mandate to fight for Britain and give me the mandate to deliver for Britain. “My message to the people of Scotland is clear: every vote for me and my team will strengthen my hand in the Brexit negotiations. That will strengthen the union, strengthen the economy, and the UK and Scotland together will flourish because if Scotland is flourishing the rest of the United Kingdom is flourishing too.”  A Conservative source said May also did door-knocking and visited a business for a roundtable in Aberdeenshire, and campaigned in Maidenhead where she met voters on the high street. “The PM has visited cities, large and small towns and today she visited a rural community,” the source said. “She has been in the three nations of Great Britain since the start of the campaign. In contrast Corbyn today ventured all of two miles from his own house to give a speech about himself.”

Secondary schools in England are facing a “perfect storm” of pressures that could have severe consequences for children, headteachers have said. Budget cuts, changes to exams, problems recruiting teachers and Brexit are causing major upheaval, according to the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT).      'Schools are in jeopardy': teachers renew funding plea in run-up to polls           Read more       The union is also expected to argue against government proposals to expand grammar schools at its annual conference this weekend.  Speaking ahead of the Telford meeting, the NAHT general secretary, Russell Hobby, said: “The combination of challenges facing secondary schools and their students has never been greater.  “Many school leaders are concerned about maintaining high standards in the face of simultaneous upheaval on so many fronts. It’s a perfect storm. The government is loading more uncertainty onto the secondary system than ever before. There is a real risk it will break.” Hobby repeated warnings that schools are facing “unacceptable levels of financial pressure”, with an NAHT survey showing that 72% of headteachers believe that school budgets will be unsustainable in two years’ time.  “This is a result of the government’s choice to freeze spending and keep it at 2010 levels for each pupil. The 2010 cash isn’t going as far as it used to. You can’t expect it to. But the government is flatly refusing to admit the reality.”      Crammed in like sardines? Share your experiences of school class sizes           Read more       Ministers have argued that school funding is at record levels, and that this will increase further as pupil numbers rise. The outgoing NAHT president, Kim Johnson, attacked suggestions that schools need to make efficiency savings. “It’s quite insulting to have ministers say to you: ‘You need to renegotiate your photocopying contract, perhaps think about the paper you’re getting in, club together with six other schools and you’ll get it cheaper.’”  Schools are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain staff, the NAHT said, particularly in key subjects such as maths, science and languages. “Year after year, the government has missed its own targets for teacher recruitment,” Hobby said. “Thirty per cent of new teachers leave the profession after five years.  “NAHT’s own research shows school leaders have struggled or failed to recruit in eight out of 10 cases this year. Recruitment has never been more challenging.” Schools are also dealing with exam changes this summer, including a new GCSE grading system. There are also concerns about a government expectation that 90% of pupils will study English Baccalaureate subjects – English, maths, science, history or geography and a language - narrowing the curriculum, the NAHT said, and uncertainty about how Brexit will affect the thousands of EU nationals who work in schools. The NAHT’s motion on selective schools says the union should “campaign vigorously to reject the proposed expansion of selection” in the absence of “any compelling evidence that it promotes social mobility”. Theresa May has said the policy will help to create a place at a good school for every child and argued that many children’s school choices are determined by where they live or their parents’ wealth.

EU leaders have unanimously agreed tough negotiating guidelines for Brexit talks with the UK, suggesting they will demand that Britain agrees on payments to the bloc before considering a new trade deal. The heads of the remaining 27 EU countries agreed to adopt the draft guidelines issued by Donald Tusk last month less than 15 minutes into a special summit in Brussels on Saturday. The European council president tweeted that a “firm and fair political mandate” for the negotiations was now ready. A senior EU source said the leaders’ decision took only one minute of discussion.     Weak pound melts the British dream of a place in the sun           Read more       When the formal negotiations between the EU and the UK begin in June, the British government will be told it needs to resolve the key divorce issues of citizens’ rights, the estimated €60bn (£51bn) divorce bill and the Irish border before any talks on a future trade deal can begin. As he arrived at the summit earlier in the day, the French president, François Hollande, said: “There will inevitably be a price and a cost for Britain, it’s the choice they made. “We must not be punitive, but at the same time it’s clear that Europe knows how to defend its interests, and that Britain will have a less good position outside the EU than in the EU.” The comments were echoed by the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, who said there was no such thing as a “free Brexit”. Asked about the British prime minister’s claim that she will be strengthened by an election victory, Hollande, who is now in his last week as president, said: “That is an election argument that I can understand, but this is not an argument against the European Union. Why? Because the bases, the principles, the objectives are already fixed. These will be the lines that will be chosen by the negotiators and there will be no others.” Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, also ruled out the idea of Theresa May gaining any advantage from an election win. “It’s an internal problem she wants to resolve in the Conservative party, to have not a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit, but Theresa’s Brexit,” he said. “We are very united. You seem surprised, but it’s a fact.” The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it was in Britain’s interests for the EU to be unified, as it would boost the chances of a deal.     EU leaders to insist UK pays its Brexit bills as precursor to trade talks           Read more       “This extraordinary meeting shows the unity of the 27 on a clear line, but this unity is not directed against Britain, I think that it is also in its interest,” he said. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said that only once there was sufficient trust between the EU nations and Britain on the core issues could both sides proceed to discuss future relations. Rutte, who stressed the importance of Britain to the Dutch economy, told reporters that “as you get to a certain level, as far as possible, and say now we are confident about this, then we have to swiftly start talking about the future relationships trade and also politics”. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had earlier in the week accused some in the UK of being deluded about the consequences of leaving the EU, but offered a softer tone in Brussels. “We want to have good relations with Great Britain in the future, but we want to represent our interests as the 27. So far this has been a real success,” she said. “We will hold the negotiations on separation first and then at a certain point when the substantive points in the separation negotations we will come to a point when we can talk about the future. “The separation negotiations on the rights of citizens of our states in the UK and of UK citizens in the EU. Also financial questions are part of the separation questions.” There is some pessimism in Brussels about the prospect of a deal being struck over the next two years, though some EU officials have taken heart from the fact that May has not recently repeated her claim that “no deal is better than a bad deal” despite being pushed to do so by politicians in favour of a hard Brexit. “We are convinced that no deal is in no one’s interest. We appreciate the fact that the tone of the debate in the UK on this issue has changed,” said a senior EU official on Friday. Asked, however, to respond to May’s claims on the general election campaign trail that member states were preparing to “line up to oppose us”, one senior EU diplomat said: “She’s right. She should not underestimate the commitment to unity.” Key negotiating points for the EU27 1. There will be no “cherry picking” of the four core single market freedoms, which are “indivisible”. This rules out government’s hope of keeping “elements of a single market” without free movement of people. 2. The 27 countries will negotiate with Britain as a unified block, relying on the principle that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”. No individual countries will be allowed backchannel chats on future trade deals while the transition is still being talked through. 3. There should be a phased approach to Britain’s withdrawal. The first phase will set out to “avoid disruption” from an “abrupt change”, and the main priority will be to give certainty to EU citizens about their legal status. Once that is decided, the European council will give the go ahead for next phase of withdrawal, which would involve working out a framework for the future relationship. 4. Citizens’ rights will be the “first priority of the negotiations”. The rights of EU and UK citizens will be protected when the UK formally leaves, which at this point looks as if it will be around March 2019. This means that any EU national who has been living in the UK for five years by that point will be protected. 5. “Flexible and imaginative solutions” will be sought to the thorny issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which has been fluid since the Good Friday agreement. Negotiations will aim to avoid establishing a hard border, which it is feared could trigger a return to violence. 6. No final figure for the divorce has been given, but the bloc will pursue one “single financial settlement”, meaning the UK will continue budget payments until 2020.

The doomed plan for a garden bridge across the Thames has been defended by one of the project’s strongest proponents, the actor Joanna Lumley. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, effectively pulled the plug on the controversial plan on Friday, announcing that he would not provide the vital financial guarantees needed for construction to begin.     The garden bridge is dead – now £37m of public money must be repaid           Read more       The Garden Bridge Trust, which is responsible for realising Thomas Heatherwick’s design, vowed to fight on despite Khan’s decision, pinning its hopes on persuading another public body, such as the Department for Transport, to step in as guarantor. Lumley, who is well known as Patsy in BBC sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, originally devised the proposal for a garden over the Thames featuring hundreds of trees and thousands of other plants, winning support from Boris Johnson, Khan’s predecessor as mayor and the then chancellor, George Osborne. Speaking to the Times newspaper, Lumley said Khan’s decision to remove financial backing was “absolutely shattering, devastating”. “The negativity troubles me in my heart. I hope we’re not turning into the sort of country that instantly says no before it considers saying yes,” she said. “A nation that just pulls the shutters down. The silent majority still love the bridge, but of course they were not asked what they think.” Osborne committed £60m of public funding to the scheme when he was in office. The Department for Transport has already given £30m and Transport for London contributed £30m, £20m of which structured as a loan.

Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA   In a study of the project commissioned by city hall, the Labour MP Margaret Hodge found the bridge was likely to cost more than £200m, and that £37.4m of public funds had already been spent without any building work taking place. Lumley told the Times the project had been politicised. “There was so much negativity about this £60m of public money,” she said. “All we heard was £60m, £60m, £60m. But . . . it’ll work out at about 32p a person in the UK. It’s not as if we’re stealing bread from people.” In a letter to Lord Davies, the Labour life peer and former government minister who chairs the trust, Khan said the cash had been spent before final land agreements had been sealed. Khan wrote: “It is concerning that a huge amount of effort and expenditure has been expended on other aspects of the project when there is a real possibility that agreement will not be reached before the expiry of planning permission, or at all.” Responding to Khan’s decision, Davies said the trust had received the letter with great regret. “We will study the contents of the letter in detail before responding formally. The Garden Bridge Trust was set up at the request of Transport for London and the Department of Transport to deliver the project which had received public money,” he said. “We have had enormous support from our funders and are very confident we can raise the remaining funds required. But sadly, the mayor of London has taken a different decision to those in place when the project started.”

Hundreds of private patients of a surgeon convicted of carrying out needless breast operations are seeking compensation after nearly £18m worth of claims were made against the NHS. Ian Paterson, 59, was convicted on Friday of 17 counts of wounding with intent and three counts of unlawful wounding against 10 patients, upon whom he conducted “extensive, life-changing operations for no medically justifiable reason”. More than 250 NHS patients have received payouts, and it has now emerged that around 350 patients who underwent treatment at private Spire Healthcare clinics in the West Midlands are also taking civil action against Paterson and the firm. Paterson, described in court by one victim as being “like God”, lied to patients and exaggerated or invented the risk of cancer to convince them to go under his knife. Thompsons Solicitors, a firm representing the private patients, said Spire Healthcare’s treatment of those who complained had been shabby. “We are determined to secure appropriate compensation for every single one of our clients, some of whom found the courage to come forward only as recently as four weeks ago,” said Linda Millband, the lead national lawyer at the firm. “Spire needs to face up to its responsibilities, because they let him operate well after he was suspended by the NHS.” A freedom of information request revealed the NHS had resolved 256 cases, paying out £9.5m in compensation and £8.2m in costs. Another 25 cases are still to be heard. Paterson was suspended by the General Medical Council in 2011. He sobbed as the jury returned the guilty verdicts at Nottingham crown court. He was released on conditional bail ahead of sentencing in May, when he faces a custodial sentence.  One patient who gave evidence in the trial had 27 biopsy cores taken from her healthy right breast and had “absolutely not” received medical best practice. A Spire Healthcare spokesman said: “What Mr Paterson did in our hospitals, in other private hospitals and in the NHS, absolutely should not have happened and today justice has been done. “We would like to reiterate how truly sorry we are for the distress experienced by any patients affected by this case. We can say unequivocally that we have learned the lessons from these events. “We commissioned a thorough independent investigation and have fully implemented all of the recommendations.”

A Metropolitan police officer who has been crawling the London Marathon in a gorilla costume since the race began on Sunday morning has completed the 26-mile route.     Don’t insult gorillas by comparing them to Donald Trump | Ros Coward           Read more       Tom Harrison, who goes by the name Mr Gorilla, is raising money for the Gorilla Organisation. The 41-year-old Londoner started at 10.34am on Sunday and crossed the finish line at 11.45am on Saturday.  He has slept at friends’ houses in the evenings after completing about 10 to 12 hours and 4.5 miles per day and has swapped between crawling on hands and knees and up on hands and feet to save his blistered knees.  Harrison crossed the finish line on the Mall flanked by his two sons and beating his chest. He said: “It was tough at points, but I am really glad I did it.”  The Putney-based police officer said he had run the marathon in the gorilla suit last year, but this time wanted to do “that little bit more”. He said: “The first couple of days, people were giving me weird looks and a wide berth. But by day three more people had started hearing about it: I started getting people beeping their horns and clapping and cheering.” On his unique view of the capital over the past seven days, he said: “One thing I noticed was that being at exhaust height, it was really catching my throat. You just notice the pollution side of things that much more.

I had helpers in front of me telling me to go left, right and so on so that I didn’t hit lamp-posts or trees.”  Harrison said he was most looking forward to getting a massage for his aching shoulders, and having a cup of coffee, as it had upset his stomach during the race. “Your stomach is not used to being in that position, so it gave me a bit of heartburn,” he said.  He was met at the finish line by Gorilla Organisation chair Ian Redmond and conservationist Bill Oddie, who handed him a trophy and a stuffed gorilla.  The Gorilla Organisation is dedicated to conserving gorillas in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Harrison’s JustGiving page for his marathon effort has so far raised more than £23,000 for the charity.  In his costume, the police officer has taken part in a series of fundraisers for the cause, including the Great Gorilla Run, Tough Mudder and running the same marathon last year.  “He’s just this incredible personality who seems to me to be absolutely fearless, but he loves the gorillas.” said Jillian Miller, the charity’s director. “I thought he was mad at first, but you know when Tom sets his heart to do something, he absolutely does it.”

Theresa May has committed to delivering the HS2 high-speed rail link. The prime minister was reportedly coming under pressure from Tory MPs in the south to cancel HS2, which the government projects will cost £55.7bn. Her announcement ends speculation that she was preparing to drop the new north-south railway from the Conservatives’ general election manifesto.  In an interview with the Yorkshire Post, May said: “We remain absolutely committed to HS2. It is a very important infrastructure project for the country. It is important that we increase capacity on this mainline and I believe that HS2 is the right way to do that.  “I’m very keen that we do have a country that works for everyone, and that means every part of the country, and that’s why we’ve introduced the modern industrial strategy, we’ve consulted on that and had very good and positive constructive response from business on that.  “Because we want to ensure that in every part of the country we are identifying the benefits they have, the types of economic development that are best suited. How can we encourage that?  “Infrastructure development is a hugely important part of that, it’s why in the autumn statement we were clear that we we’re putting extra money through to 2020 in infrastructure development.”  The first phase of HS2 is due to open in December 2026 and will see trains travel at high speed between London and Birmingham before running on from Birmingham on the existing west coast mainline. A second Y-shaped phase will open in two stages. Phase 2a from the West Midlands to Crewe will launch in 2027 and phase 2b, from Crewe to Manchester and from the West Midlands to Leeds, South Yorkshire and the East Midlands, will open in 2033. May was more cautious about fully committing to an “HS3” or “northern powerhouse” rail link. In the 2016 budget, the then chancellor George Osborne set aside £60m to develop plans to cut journey times to around 30 minutes between Leeds and Manchester, and to improve transport connections between other northern cities. The PM told the newspaper: “The issue is there are a number of options that are being looked at in relation to HS3 or northern powerhouse rail. But what I would say is those big projects are not the only way in which we are looking to invest in transport in the region.”

Ambitious plans to launch satellites from spaceports in Britain are in danger of being grounded by poor legislation that leaves operators open to crippling insurance costs, MPs have warned. The government hopes to have satellites flown into orbit from UK spaceports by 2020, but a draft version of the spaceflight bill states that companies could face unlimited liability for any damages caused by falling space hardware.     Space race: eight sites shortlisted for UK's first commercial spaceport           Read more       The wording of the new bill appears to counter an amendment to the 1986 Outer Space Act made in 2015, which imposed a €60m cap on the amount that spaceflight companies are required to indemnify the government. “Lax wording in the bill leaves it open that an operator would have to indemnify the government against all losses and that makes it completely impractical,” said Stephen Metcalfe, chair of the cross-party science and technology committee. In a report published on Saturday, the committee calls for revisions to the bill to ensure that Britain’s ambitions in commercial spaceflight are not undermined. The MPs are also seeking clarification on whether a €60m cap on the insurance for missions would apply per launch or to individual satellites “For multiple satellite constellations where you might launch 20 small satellites at once, you couldn’t possibly expect someone to indemnify €60m for each of them,” Metcalfe said. The draft bill sets out the legal framework that will be needed for spaceport and satellite companies to gain a share of the commercial spaceflight market which is estimated to be worth £25bn over the next 20 years. On Friday, the UK Space Agency took bids for £10m of grants for satellite launchers and spaceport operators to build facilities and launch vehicles.     UK Space Agency to create £4m testing facility           Read more       But Stuart McIntyre, chief executive at Orbital Access, a UK satellite launch company, said that questions around liability and insurance should be addressed only once the broad, overarching bill had been introduced. “To delay the passage of the bill would be entirely counterproductive,” he said. “The UK faces a fantastic opportunity right now. Momentum and decisive progress is the key here if we want to capture that opportunity. It is one that does not come round often, and we have to take it.” The committee took evidence from a number of witnesses from the aerospace industry before publishing its report. They included McIntyre and other engineers and scientists hoping to develop revolutionary space planes that could take off and land at British spaceports. Metcalfe said the committee’s report identified areas where the next government “needs to look again” before a final bill is introduced. A number of coastal aerodromes in Scotland, Wales and Cornwall have been proposed as possible sites for spaceports.

Catholic bishops in England and Wales are facing a fresh call for a national commission on the ordination of married men amid mounting concern that the church’s celibacy requirement is contributing to a shortage of priests. The call for a review of celibacy as a condition of priesthood comes after Pope Francis signalled last month he was open to the possibility of ordaining married men under specific conditions. The issue is expected to raised at a synod next year on vocation. The Movement for Married Clergy (MMaC) is renewing its call for a national commission of bishops, clergy and laity to discuss ways of tackling the shortage of priests. “We’re asking bishops to recognise the issue and examine possible solutions in good faith,” said the MMaC secretary, Chris McDonnell. A recent editorial in the Catholic Times endorsed the call. “What has the church got to lose by establishing such a commission? Or perhaps more importantly, the focus should concentrate on what the church has to gain from such a move,” it said. According to Catholic church figures, 25 men entered training for the diocesan priesthood in 2016 for England and Wales compared with more than 150 in 1985, although the pace of decline has slowed in recent years. “We have a very advancing age profile of serving priests, and low numbers of people going into seminaries,” said McDonnell. “At the moment, it’s just about manageable. But in five years’ time it’s going to be very different. We want to use this window of opportunity to look at what could be done.” Last year it was announced that a third of the 62 Catholic churches in north Wales would close by 2020 because of a shortage of priests under the retirement age. In January, Salford diocese said more than 20 churches across Greater Manchester would close and about 100 parishes would merge, partly because of falling numbers of priests. The MMaC said Pope Francis’s comments suggested a new openness to the idea of married priests. In a separate interview, Cardinal Walter Kasper, a German theologian close to Francis, said the pope wanted to leave the decision up to local bishops’ conferences. “The [vocation] situation differs so widely in different parts of the world that a uniform worldwide solution is not possible,” Kasper told a German church website, katholisch.de. Each bishops’ conference should decide whether it was in favour of married priests and then submit proposals to the pope. “I have the feeling that if their application is well-founded, it will be met positively.” He added: “We simply cannot carry on with the situation as it is at the present … One cannot just go on clustering more and more parishes together into ever larger entities.” Celibacy is a matter of church discipline rather than doctrine, and Catholic priests were often married up until the 12th century. In the UK, married Anglican clergy who joined the Catholic church in disagreement over the ordination of women have continued to serve as priests. “I think the vast majority of lay Catholics would accept married clergy – particularly young people for whom it is a no-brainer,” said McDonnell. “But we want to be very clear that we’re not rejecting celibacy. If a man decides as part of his vocation to be celibate, we’d applaud his dedication. Celibacy and the priesthood should not be considered incompatible.” Two of the church’s 22 serving bishops, Tom Burns of Menevia and Seamus Cunningham of Hexham and Newcastle, and three retired bishops have backed married priests in recent years. However, the bishops’ conference of England and Wales rejected a proposal to ordain married men in 2015. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, archbishop of Westminster and leader of the church in England and Wales, has said he sees no need for change. “I don’t think we are in a [vocations] crisis in England and Wales.” he told the Irish Catholic in February. adding: “I personally value … the celibacy of the priesthood.” Father Christopher Jamison of the Catholic National Office for Vocation said he had “no problem” with the ordination of married men, but “it does not solve the fundamental challenges facing churches today”. He pointed out that the Anglican church ordained married men and women yet still faced a clergy shortage and declining congregations. Pope Francis has said the next synod in October 2018 will discuss the decline in vocations. Reports have suggested the pope wanted the issue of celibacy to be discussed but yielded to objections from his advisers.

Edward Colston is, says Katie Finnegan-Clarke, “almost like a cult figure” in Bristol. There is a Colston Street, and Colston Tower is on Colston Avenue. There is even a Colston bun, which you might eat on Colston’s Day. Finnegan-Clarke, one of the activists in the Countering Colston campaign, went to Colston’s Girls’ school, where “there are statues everywhere, and we had three ceremonies every year to celebrate his life.” Colston was a 17th-century philanthropist who gave great sums of money to the city – money he had made from slavery. This week it was announced that there would be one less Bristol institution bearing his name. The concert venue Colston Hall – which has been a target for activists for decades – will reopen in 2020, after its refurbishment, with a new name. “We knew it was the right thing for the organisation,” says Louise Mitchell, the chief executive of the trust that runs the venue. “It’s very important to us as a progressive forward-looking arts organisation that we include everybody, and people felt uncomfortable entering the building because of the perception that it had in some way profited from the slave trade.” That wasn’t technically true, she says – it was built nearly 150 years after Colston’s death, and was unimaginatively named after its address, Colston Street, but its name still stands as a memorial to the man. It has seen performances from giants such as Ella Fitzgerald, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and David Bowie, but the Bristol band Massive Attack have famously boycotted the venue because of its name. “There are very strong views on both sides; we always knew there would be a backlash,” she says. “Some people are cheering, some are booing, but what I had to do was take the right decision for the organisation. We can’t be inclusive if people won’t come into the building.” A poll for the Bristol Post had found that people opposed renaming the venue two to one, and there have been accusations of airbrushing history. “I think the organisations that hold him up in that honorary position are the ones who are airbrushing history,” says Finnegan-Clarke. “He was one of the most powerful slave traders in Britain: 85,000 Africans were kidnapped and enslaved while he was running the Royal Africa Company. I think by honouring him, that’s airbrushing history.”                                    Facebook        Twitter        Pinterest         A flyer for a Beatles concert at Colston Hall in Bristol in March 1963. Photograph: Alamy   The renaming of Colston Hall “is probably the first significant change in the UK,” says Nicholas Draper, director of the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at UCL. “There will be others. It’s a wider process that’s unfolding in the US, and is probably true in France to a degree. Anywhere there is the significant imprint of slavery, and maybe the wider imprint of colonialism, then this will happen more and more. We’ve had, in the end, a public culture that has been relatively unreflective of the post-colonial moment, and that’s no longer a tenable position.” There are other campaigns in Bristol, a city built on wealth accrued through the slave trade. Countering Colston has its sights set on the large bronze statue in the city centre, which it wants moved to a museum. At the University of Bristol, there is a campaign to rename the Wills Memorial Building. Henry Overton Wills was from the tobacco-giant family, and Wills “symbolises the great wealth acquired through the enslavement of individuals of African descent,” says Asher Websdale, one of three students who started a petition. “It’s not a name that the student body can unanimously state they are proud to stand as a centrepiece in the university. Our history lacks the commemoration of women and people of colour; a name change could allow us to take a step toward rectifying this injustice.” In February, a city councillor in Glasgow proposed – temporarily, but symbolically – renaming Buchanan and Dunlop Street, named in honour of tobacco magnates. Nina Baker, a Green party councillor, acknowledges it would take a huge effort to rename them permanently, but, she says, “I thought we could start the ball rolling by raising awareness. I’d seen something about Spain doing this, renaming streets that had been named after fascist-era people after women freedom-fighters.” The same was proposed in Liverpool in 2006, about Tarleton Street, Manesty’s Lane and Clarence Street, but the idea was dropped – partly because it would have meant renaming Penny Lane, which was named to commemorate slave ship-owner James Penny, but is now more famous as the title of a Beatles song. The US is ahead of Britain on this. This week, Confederate monuments were removed from streets in New Orleans. “The removal of these statues sends a clear and unequivocal message to the people of New Orleans and the nation: New Orleans celebrates our diversity, inclusion and tolerance,” says mayor, Mitch Landrieu. “Relocating these Confederate monuments is not about taking something away from someone else. This is not about politics, blame or retaliation. This is not a naive quest to solve all our problems at once. This is about showing the whole world that we as a city and as a people are able to acknowledge, understand, reconcile – and most importantly – choose a better future. We can remember these divisive chapters in our history in a museum or other facility where they can be put in context – and that’s where these statues belong.” Forrest Park in Memphis – originally named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Confederate general and first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan – was renamed in 2013; the KKK protested.

In February, following a long wrangle, Yale announced it would change the name of Calhoun College (named after John Calhoun, a US vice-president and supporter of slavery,) but it will not remove symbols of him around the campus. In 2015, there were student-led protests at Princeton to remove former president and segregationist Woodrow Wilson’s name from the university (the university refused). Last year, Harvard Law School dropped its seal, which was based on the family crest of a slave-owner, Isaac Royall. The Rhodes Must Fall movement started in 2015 at the University of Cape Town, to remove a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes, and spread to other universities, including Oxford, which has a statue of Rhodes at Oriel College. Earlier this year, there was discussion about removing eugenicist Francis Galton’s name from a lecture theatre and laboratory at UCL. Not everyone thinks renaming is the answer – and renaming, anyway, is only a small part of ongoing discussions about how countries should deal with their involvement in slavery. “The danger is we end up erasing the past rather than problematising it,” says John Oldfield, director of the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation at Hull University. “An alternative strategy might be to use these names as a way of drawing attention to the complexities. You should use those names to discuss the past, because that informs how we understand the present.” He points to the way Brown University in the US has acknowledged its past. Brown is considered the leader on this issue: president Ruth Simmons commissioned a report on the university’s history, and as a result introduced a number of measures including establishing the Centre for the Study of Slavery and Justice, and an endowment fund to support disadvantaged children. In Bristol, many say that it is not possible to forget the city’s connection to the brutal trade in human beings. “It cannot be airbrushed. There are so many other things in Bristol that remind us about the slaving past,” says Olivette Otele, a historian at Bath Spa university. The issue is that a name given to a place or building is “a recognition of a contribution, it’s a celebration”.  Legacies of British slave ownership map infographic  Based on a map provided by the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at UCL   What is happening in Bristol, she says, “is important because it means Bristolians themselves are shaping their own present, and how they want to remember the past and write the future. It’s their decision, and I’m excited about the whole thing.” Things get more complicated when one considers where such moves should stop. Draper likes to think of it in terms of a hierarchy, or concentric circles, where slave-traders would be the “bullseye”, with owners of enslaved people closely following, and people who benefited from the trade, the bankers who financed it, and people who had connections, however remote, in the outer rings. “We’d need to have some sense of where the boundaries are, or could be. But I think ‘slave-trader’ is something very difficult to push away.” Does it matter if most people passing a statue or a place name have no idea who the commemorated person is? “Isn’t that exactly the point?” he says. “That we’re celebrating people, and have forgotten what they did?” The writer Amit Chaudhuri was invited to address Rhodes Must Fall activists at Oxford in 2015. In a piece he wrote for the Guardian, he remembered how he hadn’t noticed the Rhodes sculpture when his wife was at Oriel College in the early 1990s, and recalled once looking in on a talk given by Enoch Powell, not with horror, but a feeling that the once-divisive politician was now irrelevant, a relic; it seemed to him as though we were heading towards genuine equality and diversity. But two decades on, he argues that something else entirely is going on, and points to “how narrow the culture has become in Britain, in a very insidious way”.      Bristol: the city that lauds the slave trader | David Olusoga           Read more       Over the last 20 years, and particularly since 9/11, he says, there has been a turn against multiculturalism – some people have become seen as a threat to “our” way of life, resulting in a kind of closing down. It was there in Theresa May’s vans targeting “illegal” migrants, he says, in fears over immigration and the nostalgia for past British “glories” that stoked Brexit, and in the government’s pitiful response to the refugee crisis. The other thing that has happened, he argues, is a widening economic gulf between the rich and those who have suffered most from the economic crash. “The affluent of the past, who became affluent out of exploitation – statues of those people begin to kind of chafe.” The statues and names, and the history they stand for, “seem to be in collusion with the closing down that’s happening, and the [class] who are protecting themselves. I think that’s part of why it has become more urgent today. I don’t know what the solution is, in terms of removing statues or renaming places, but at the same time, I can understand why it’s happening.”

Alexander Blackman, the Royal Marine sergeant convicted of killing a wounded Taliban fighter, has been enjoying his first hours of freedom but has made it clear he understands his sentence is not complete and has promised to fulfil the conditions of his early release. Blackman was freed from prison after serving half of the seven-year term imposed for manslaughter and was whisked away to a luxury country hideaway arranged by the Daily Mail, which backed his legal fight.  He told the tabloid: “Being out of prison is an immense feeling but I am very conscious that my sentence is not complete. I have been released on licence and there are certain conditions which I must – and will – respect.   “But it is the little things I can enjoy. Suddenly I can sleep when I want, eat when I want, go for a walk ... this freedom of choice over basic things is going to take some getting used to.”  Typically prisoners on licence have to stay in close touch with a supervisor, seek permission before travelling out of the UK and get approval for any work they take on. Misbehaviour can result in a return to jail.  Blackman described his wife, who led the campaign to free him, as a “wife in a million”. He said: “I will be eternally grateful to Claire and I cannot put into words how wonderful she is.  “Other inmates often said how lucky I was to have her fighting so hard for me. I don’t think there is anybody who has witnessed the effort she has gone to who will doubt how she feels about me, and that’s beyond words really. You just can’t imagine anyone cares for you that much.” Claire Blackman told the Mail she had felt a “surge of happiness” when her husband arrived at the country bolthole, describing their reunion as “like a dream”. “We have spent so long on this rollercoaster ride and have always steeled ourselves for the worst-case scenario,” she said. “Now we have got Al out, the result we always hoped for, it is taking time to sink in.” Blackman was convicted in 2013 of murdering a Taliban prisoner while on tour in Helmand province in Afghanistan, and jailed for life. The conviction was quashed when the court martial appeal court ruled he had been suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the shooting in 2011.  His conviction was replaced with manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and his sentence reduced from life to seven years. He was smuggled out of prison in Wiltshire in the early hours of Friday and was taken to a rural hideaway, where according to the Mail, he was treated to Hungarian goose-down duvets, roaring fires and roll-top baths.  He has been offered a job by the former marine John Davies, who also campaigned for Blackman to be freed, as an instructor in his maritime training business.  The Guardian has also learned that Blackman has enjoyed writing while in prison and may try to get a children’s story about a cuddly mole published.  According to his lawyer, Jonathan Goldberg QC, there is also interest from Hollywood in making a film of the saga.   Blackman is still entitled to a military pension and supporters have raised money to help him and his wife set themselves up.  The documentary-maker and honorary marine Chris Terrill, who has become close to the Blackmans, said he believed there would be a tricky transition period for the marine.   He said: “It is going to be a difficult transition. Al hasn’t been a civilian for many years.” Terrill also said there would also be a time of readjustment for husband and wife. “I was joking with Claire that they’ll have to work out who is going to control the television zapper.”  He said the idea of a Hollywood film with a star-studded cast was fanciful. “This is not the time to be talking about Hollywood blockbusters,” he said. “It’s a great time for the Blackmans, but it’s a very serious time, too.” Terrill said it was worth remembering the man Blackman had killed. “He was someone’s son, brother, possibly husband.”  Life will never be the same for the Blackmans. The Guardian revealed last month that police had warned them they could be terrorist targets and they have been advised to take a series of precautions including changing their identities and moving house.  Supporters across the country will celebrate Blackman’s release this bank holiday weekend.   The Justice for Marine A website said: “Al fought for us … we fought for him and and against all odds we won. Thank you all for your amazing efforts.”

A long-serving Conservative MP has said he will not stand in the general election, just hours after A-level students revealed he had told them that he believed “homosexuality is wrong” and “dangerous to society”. Andrew Turner, who has represented the Isle of Wight since 2001, made the comments during a question and answer session at Christ the King College in Newport. One student describing herself as a “passionate campaigner for LGBT rights” asked her local MP if he was involved in the Isle of Wight’s first ever Pride event. In a post on Facebook, Esther Poucher said she was shocked to the point of outrage by Turner’s response. “He told us that he’d been invited, but wasn’t intending to go. This is because (and this is a direct quote) he thinks that homosexuality is ‘wrong’ and “dangerous to society’,” she wrote.                              Facebook        Twitter        Pinterest         Student Esther Poucher Photograph: Facebook   “At this answer, I had to leave. It’s terrifying that in this age and point in our development as a society, there are still people that can’t care enough about a person’s wellbeing to just accept who they are. And the most terrifying thing is that we as an island consistently vote him in to represent us.” Labour’s election campaign chair, Andrew Gwynne, had called on Theresa May to “intervene and investigate immediately” and suspend Turner as a Tory candidate if the allegations were found to be true. “There is no place for bigotry and hatred like this in modern society and no one holding these views is fit for public office.” He said he looked forward to the prime minister speaking out against the suggestion of homophobia in her party to show she was serious about LGBT equality.  The Guardian understands that senior figures in the Conservative party made clear that Turner’s behaviour was unacceptable and that the MP agreed to step aside before he was pushed. One Tory insider said there was “no room in the Conservative party” for homophobic comments. In his statement, Turner did not mention the row. He wrote: “It has been my privilege to serve the people of the Isle of Wight as their member of parliament. “I have been incredibly fortunate to represent such a beautiful constituency. After 16 years I have come to the decision that it is time for a new generation to take up the mantle of representing my fantastic constituents.”     Tim Farron says he doesn't believe being gay is a sin           Read more       He added that he was grateful for the support he had received and would support the Conservative candidate taking his place.  The seat is likely to be popular with Conservative hopefuls given that Turner secured a majority of 13,703 in 2015, representing 41% of the vote. Ukip were in second place with 21%, followed by Labour and the Greens on 13%.  Turner has served on the Conservative’s 1922 committee representing backbenchers and was a vice-chair of the party between 2003 and 2005. His swift decision to step down is in line with an attempt in the Conservative party headquarter’s to keep a close eye on candidates, and try to minimise any sense during the election of elite or extreme views. Sources said that senior aides to May were doing all they could to try to ensure that new candidates most closely matched her desire to appeal to working class communities that traditionally tended to back the Labour party. The prime minister has also reconvened the key figures who supported David Cameron’s 2015 successful campaign led by Sir Lynton Crosby, who is yet to move into Conservative headquarters. She has also brought back Tom Edmonds and Craig Elder who led Cameron’s digital campaign that reached 17 million people a week with bespoke material targeted at key groups of voters. The pair were described as the previous Tory leader’s “secret weapon”. Others back on board include Barack Obama’s former deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina.

The UK government was given details last December of allegedly extensive contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow, according to court papers. Reports by Christopher Steele, a former MI6 officer, on possible collusion between the the Trump camp and the Kremlin are at the centre of a political storm in the US over Moscow’s role in getting Donald Trump elected.  It was not previously known that the UK intelligence services had also received the dossier but Steele confirmed in a court filing earlier this month that he handed a memorandum compiled in December to a “senior UK government national security official acting in his official capacity, on a confidential basis in hard copy form”.     How the Trump dossier came to light: secret sources, a retired spy and John McCain           Read more       The court papers say Steele decided to pass on the information he had collected because it was “of considerable importance in relation to alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election”, that it “had implications for the national security of the US and the UK” and “needed to [be] analysed and further investigated/verified”.  The December memo alleged that four Trump representatives travelled to Prague in August or September in 2016 for “secret discussions with Kremlin representatives and associated operators/hackers”, about how to pay hackers secretly for penetrating Democratic party computer systems and “contingency plans for covering up operations”.  Between March and September, the December memo alleges, the hackers used botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs and steal data online from Democratic party leadership. Two of the hackers had been “recruited under duress by the FSB” the memo said. The hackers were paid by the Trump organisation, but were under the control of Vladimir Putin’s presidential administration. Trump has rejected the allegations of collusion as a smear campaign. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, one of Trump representatives named in the memo, has described the claims in the memo as “totally fake, totally inaccurate”, and has said he had never been to Prague.     Since the memo became public in January, Steele had not spoken about his role in compiling it but he and his company, Orbis Business Intelligence Limited, have filed a defence in the high court of justice in London, in a defamation case brought by Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian venture capitalist and owner of a global computer technology company, XBT, and a Dallas-based subsidiary Webzilla.  Gubarev, who was named along with his company in the December memo as being involved in hacking operation, has denied any such involvement and is also suing Buzzfeed in the US courts for publishing the December memo alongside Steele’s earlier reports on election hacking.  A statement by Steele’s defence lawyers, endorsed by the former MI6 agent, said Orbis was hired between June and November last year by Fusion GPS, a Washington-based research consultancy to look into Trump’s links with Russia. In that period, Steele produced 16 memoranda citing mostly Russian sources as describing a web of alleged contacts and collusion between Trump aides and Russian intelligence or other Kremlin representatives. The document said that he passed the memos to Fusion on the understanding that Fusion would not disclose the material to any third parties without the approval of Steele and Orbis. They did agree to Fusion providing a copy to Senator John McCain after the veteran Republican had been told about the existence of Steele’s research by Sir Andrew Wood, a former UK ambassador to Moscow and an Orbis associate, at a conference in Canada on 8 November.      What we know – and what's true – about the Trump-Russia dossier           Read more       Senator McCain handed a copy of the Steele memos to James Comey, the FBI director, on 9 December.  After delivering these reports, the court papers say Steele and Orbis continued to receive “unsolicited intelligence” on Trump-Russia links, and Steele decided that to draw up another memo with this new information which was dated 13 December.  He handed one copy over to the senior British national security official and sent an encrypted version to Fusion with instructions to deliver a hard copy to Senator McCain.  The defence argues that Steele and Orbis were under a duty to pass on the information “so that it was known to the United Kingdom and United States governments at a high level by persons with responsibility for national security”. Steele and Orbis say they never gave any copies to news organisations although Steele said he gave off-the-record briefings about the dossier to a small number of journalists in late summer and early autumn 2016. The defence brief argues that neither Steele nor Orbis is liable for Buzzfeed’s decision to print the document.  The Steele dossier was referred to in an intelligence briefing provided by the FBI and US intelligence agencies to Obama and Trump in January. Comey has confirmed that counter-intelligence investigations are under way into possible links between Trump associates and Moscow, and CNN has reported that the FBI used the dossier to bolster its investigations.

EU leaders will toughen their stance on Britain paying its Brexit bills when they agree negotiating guidelines at a special summit on Saturday. EU diplomats have agreed unanimously that Britain must settle its bills before embarking on trade talks. The position has been set out by EU leaders from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, but this will be the toughest statement yet from all 27 countries.     Tories’ ‘imperial vision’ for post-Brexit trade branded disruptive and deluded           Read more       “Member states are maximalist on the budget issue, because if Britain doesn’t pay, other member states will have to pay,” an EU diplomat said. Another senior diplomat said he had never seen net payers and recipients “working so closely with each other” in a wry allusion to the perennial tensions between countries that pay most into the EU budget and those that receive the biggest grants. The UK is due to make a net payment of around £20.4bn into the EU pot in 2019-20, in line with a promise David Cameron made in 2012 when he negotiated the EU’s seven-year budget. The European commission, however, believes the bill could come to as much as €60bn (£50bn) once the UK’s contribution to EU liabilities, pensions and special funds is taken into account. Barnier’s team will not present a bill on day one of the talks, but instead hopes to bind Britain to a set of principles on paying its dues, an approach broadly backed by Germany. EU leaders will not get into the specifics of money or the other two issues seen as essential parts of the divorce deal - citizens’ rights and the Irish border - on Saturday. They will focus discussions on what counts as sufficient progress for talks to start on trade. If they agree the UK has made progress on the divorce by the autumn, talks on a trade deal could start from early 2018.     Weak pound melts the British dream of a place in the sun           Read more       Separate to the EU’s negotiating guidelines, the leaders will discuss a text that would affirm Northern Ireland’s right to join the EU if the island were to unite. Diplomats stress that they do not expect Irish unification.  In a letter to EU leaders ahead of the summit, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, reiterated that the bloc would stick to its timetable. “We will not discuss our future relations with the UK until we have achieved sufficient progress on the main issues relating to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU,” he said. “This is not only a matter of tactics, but - given the limited time frame we have to conclude the talks – it is the only possible approach.” EU leaders will also be briefed by Jean-Claude Juncker on his dinner with Theresa May at Downing Street earlier this week. Merkel was given the key points in an early morning phone call with the European commission president on Thursday. A few hours later she told German MPs that British politicians were still living under the illusion that the country could retain its rights and privileges after Brexit.     Britons could lose health cover in Europe after Brexit, report warns           Read more       EU sources have different views on the British government’s approach to Brexit. Some detect a new tone coming from London, with one senior diplomat talking of “much more realism on the negative consequences of no deal”. Others think London has not “engaged with reality”. One EU diplomat put the chances of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal at higher than 50%. “They are not just on a different planet, they are in a different galaxy,” the diplomat said.  EU insiders are also uncertain about who Barnier will face across the negotiating table, whether it will be the Brexit minister, David Davis, or one of Theresa May’s top advisers. “I have no idea,” said one senior source.

The NHS has been forced to pay out almost £10m in compensation to more than 250 patients of a rogue surgeon found guilty of carrying out needless breast operations on patients who were left traumatised and scarred. Consultant surgeon Ian Stuart Paterson, 59, was convicted on Friday of 17 counts of wounding with intent, relating to nine women and one man. He was also convicted of three further wounding charges. Jurors at the seven-week trial at Nottingham crown court decided the surgeon carried out “extensive, life-changing operations for no medically justifiable reason” on the 10 patients between 1997 and 2011. He could have more than 1,000 additional victims, among them hundreds of private Spire Healthcare patients who may never be compensated for botched and unnecessary surgery.     Ian Paterson: the 'likable' breast surgeon who wounded his patients           Read more       Paterson, described in court by one victim as being “like God”, lied to patients and exaggerated or invented the risk of cancer to convince them to go under his knife. The jury at Nottingham crown court heard the surgeon, who saw hundreds of patients a year, carried out the operations for “obscure motives”, which may have included a desire to earn extra money. Paterson, wearing a black suit, blue shirt and red tie, sobbed as the jury returned the guilty verdicts. Judge Jeremy Baker released the surgeon on conditional bail ahead of sentencing in May, telling him he faced a custodial sentence. The maximum sentence for wounding with intent is life. One patient who gave evidence in the trial had 27 biopsy cores taken from her healthy right breast, which one expert told the court were random, and had “absolutely not” received medical best practice.  In tears, Frances Perks told the jury Patterson had conned her into thinking she was high risk and that he had destroyed her life. “He’s a psychopath. Why would anyone in their right mind do operations to people knowing that they didn’t need them?” she said, adding that she hoped he would rot in hell.  A number of Paterson’s former patients have died since being treated by him. Concerns were raised about his practice of carrying out so-called “cleavage-saving mastectomies”, which left behind tissue. This method meant that the chances of a relapse within five years doubled. One patient, Michelle Flavelle, died five years after Paterson treated her when her cancer spread to her liver, though it was not possible to establish a definitive connection.  Paterson denied misrepresenting patients’ test results to dupe insurers into paying for surgery, but other former patients have told the Guardian he exaggerated or invented the risk of cancer and, in some cases, claimed payments for more expensive procedures than those he had carried out. Ch Supt Mark Payne called Paterson a “controlling bully, who played God with people’s lives so he could live a luxurious lifestyle”. “The procedures carried out by Ian Paterson on vulnerable patients were unnecessary and caused physical suffering, scars and wounds to the patients,” he said. “Also, as a result of his greed and arrogance, many of the patients have suffered psychologically, believing they needed to undergo the procedures because they were at risk from breast cancer.”     There were no depths he wouldn't go to, says Ian Paterson surgery victim           Read more       Paterson was employed by the Heart of England NHS trust in 1998 despite having previously been suspended from Good Hope hospital in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. He also practised at Spire Healthcare hospitals in the Midlands over a 13-year period. The NHS has so far paid out around £18m including £9.5m in damages, settling 256 cases, with 25 outstanding, the Guardian has learned. Hundreds of Paterson’s private patients may never see a penny after his insurance company, the Medical Defence Union, said its cover was “discretionary” and had been withdrawn.  Paterson had a limited separate insurance policy of £10m, which solicitors say will not nearly cover the compensation and costs of all private patients. Another 350 people are still suing the NHS and Spire Healthcare over treatment in private hospitals where Paterson also practised. Spire Healthcare, which runs Parkway and Little Aston hospitals have settled some cases, but argue that as Paterson was not technically their employee, they are not responsible for his actions. The company would not divulge any details about the compensation paid. A Spire spokesman said: “What Mr Paterson did in our hospitals, in other private hospitals and in the NHS, absolutely should not have happened and today justice has been done. “We would like to reiterate how truly sorry we are for the distress experienced by any patients affected by this case. “We can say unequivocally that we have learned the lessons from these events. We commissioned a thorough independent investigation and have fully implemented all of the recommendations.” Sarah Jane Downing, who set up a petition demanding compensation for Paterson’s private victims, said she had been left “shocked and appalled” at the lack of redress.                                Facebook        Twitter        Pinterest         Sarah Jane Downing said Paterson’s private patients ‘bought into those promises in the glossy brochures’. Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian   “Many of these people chose private healthcare because they bought into those promises in the glossy brochures. And now we have realised that those promises are not worth the paper they are printed on. It’s utterly devastating,” she said. At a recent coffee morning for former Paterson patients, many described the consultant’s “brilliant” bedside manner. “He was so lovely, I thought I was so lucky. I thought I was being looked after,” said Elaine Diskin, whom Paterson operated on eight times in as many years. Her husband, Mike, also respected for the surgeonto the extent that when he had a pain in his chest, he went to Paterson and did not hesitate when he said he suspected lipoma and that they “had to get it out”. “Sinister was the word he used,” Mike Diskin said. “I had no reason to doubt him because he was looking after Elaine so well.” They trusted Paterson so much that they also recommended his care to a friend, who went on to have a lump removed. “We used to joke that we’d paid for his skiing holidays,” Elaine Diskin said. After the Diskins were recalled for a review of their treatment in 2012, they discovered that at least seven of the eight operations Paterson had performed on Elaine, along with those on her husband and their friend, were unnecessary. A civil case with seven test cases, which will determine to what extent Spire, the Heart of England NHS Trust and Paterson can be held liable, is scheduled to be heard in October, but looks likely to be delayed. The outcome will affect all the private patients who have brought civil claims and fear they may receive nothing. It is believed that Spire has made a handful of payments, the largest about £150,000, including for unnecessary removal of lumps and “cleavage-sparing mastectomies”, a controversial operation that left breast tissue behind after the removal of cancerous cells. Kashmir Uppal of Access Legal has worked with Paterson’s former patients since 2010. She said his actions had terrible consequences for her clients. “I am pleased that the jury have found him guilty and hope that this verdict will start the process of closure for his victims and early settlement of their civil claims,” she said.  “However, we now need a full public enquiry to ensure tighter regulation of patient care in the private sector, and to prevent this happening in the future.” Lesley Cuthbert, who did not feature in the trial but had a series of unnecessary operations carried out by Paterson, said she was “over the moon” about the outcome. “There is no forgiveness. What he has done will always be with us, but at least we can now start to move on.” Concerns about Paterson were raised as far back as 2003, but despite several internal and external investigations and complaints from patients, GPs and other surgeons, the General Medical Council did not suspend him until 2011. “In every profession you get rogue operators, but there are checks and balances to stop terrible things happening,” said Mike Diskin. “Why were there not in this case, or why were they ignored?” Timeline 1998: Paterson is hired as a consultant surgeon at the Heart of England NHS trust, despite being previously suspended from Good Hope hospital. He also sees private patients at Spire Healthcare hospitals of Little Aston and Parkway. 2003: He is investigated because of concerns about cleavage-sparing mastectomies. Recommendations are not followed through. 2007: Breast surgeon Hemant Ingle is appointed and with others raises concerns. Further investigations are carried out and Paterson is told to stop performing cleavage-sparing mastectomies. Mark Goldman, the chief executive of the Heart of England NHS trust, informs Spire that it is investigating Paterson. 2008: Two GPs complain about Paterson’s treatment of a patient, saying he gave misleading information about pathology reports, overtreated patients and disregarded the multidisciplinary team meeting process. Another report is also critical. 2009: A Spire Parkway patient makes a formal complaint about Paterson. No action is taken. Heart of England NHS trust recalls 12 patients who have had cleavage-sparing mastectomies. West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit submits two further reports. 2010: The GMC tells Spire Parkway executives about a complaint from an NHS patient.. 2011: Parkway are informed that Paterson carried out a cleavage-sparing mastectomy in 2009 after being told to stop in January 2008. A month later, the GMC informed Spire about another patient complaint. A recall of all Paterson’s patients begins. Paterson is suspended by the NHS in May 2011 but continues to perform breast surgery for Spire until 31 May and general surgery until 8 June 2011. He is paid until November 2012.

Richard Browning, the British inventor dubbed “Wiltshire’s Iron Man”, successfully demonstrated his personal flight suit on the shores of Vancouver harbour, with mini jet engines on his hands. Inspired by the Marvel comic superhero Iron Man, Browning flew in a circle and hovered a short distance from the ground using thrusters attached to his arms and back, captivating attendees at the Vancouver TED conference. “The hypothesis was that the human mind and body, if properly augmented, could achieve some pretty cool stuff,” said Browning, an extreme athlete and engineer, at the gathering where he was representing his flight-suit startup company, Gravity. The personal flight suit, called Daedalus, is capable of propelling wearers much higher and faster than demonstrated on the day, according to Browning. He said he had experimented with various numbers and arrays of the engines on his limbs, with some more successful than others. The current suit is capable of flying for around 10 minutes.

The company has posted various videos showing flights and adjustments to the gear throughout the testing process. A flight suit that could carry a wearer from the beach along the coast and into a mid-air helicopter for further journeys are a while away, said Browning, but the firm has already received interest from investors including some from those in the British military. They told him they had given up on the flight feature of an Iron Man-style suit until seeing his human-propulsion gear.  The world’s first commercial jetpack will cost $150,000

The suspected terrorist arrested in Westminster carrying knives is a one-time humanitarian activist who is now facing questions from police about whether he was about to stage a murderous attack in central London. Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali, 27, was arrested by armed police on Thursday afternoon yards from the Houses of Parliament and the scene of the previous terrorist attack in March in which five people lost their lives. Counter-terrorism detectives continued questioning Ali on Friday. He had been under surveillance for weeks by MI5 and the Metropolitan police over concerns he had been lured by violent extremism. Ali was a schoolboy in inner north London who by the age of 21 had set sail on a ship to take relief supplies to Gaza on a mission that eschewed politics or religion but nonetheless became mired in difficulty and never reached its destination. Ali was being questioned at Southwark police station in south London, with detectives trying to piece together why he was in Westminster with two knives, what he intended to do with the implements and why. He is understood to have been a “lone actor”. Ali was born outside of Britain, moved to the UK at a young age and went to school in Tottenham, north London, a multicultural area that has a long history of neglect and where sections of the community mistrust the police and other authorities. In 2010 Ali joined the Road to Hope convoy taking aid to Gaza, sources have confirmed. He and other volunteers boarded the Strofades IV ship in Libya. The convoy leader, Kieran Turner, said it was apolitical. Turner said: “The people who were involved with this convoy were the ones who went to really do humanitarian care. “These were young men who were very keen to do something to help and for a lot of them it was a great introduction – some of them are still trustees on charities.” The voyage saw a falling out between the captain and those on board, and that part of the journey was aborted, with the vessel ending up in Greece with the humanitarian activists on board complaining of their treatment. Ali was last registered to an address in Enfield, north London, but is no longer resident there, according to official residence documents. His arrest followed counter-terrorism investigators tracking him as he traveled through London and armed officers were laying in wait and swooped on him in an area full of high-profile buildings such as the House of Parliament and Downing Street. He is alleged to have been carrying two knives in a bag that spilled out into the middle of the road as he was grabbed by police and put on the ground. Concerns about his behaviour were reported to police by at least one member of the Muslim community and led to a joint MI5 and Met police investigation.       Play Video           0:59           Armed police detain man near Houses of Parliament – video report   Ali was arrested at 2.22pm, police said, “on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. Knives have been recovered from him”. Police also said that they had carried out two searches at addresses in London as part of their inquiries into Ali. His arrest at junction of Parliament Street and Parliament Square was just yards from where Khalid Masood first drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and then used a knife to stab a police officer to death. Investigators will be examining electronic devices seized during the searches and any computers or smartphones used by Ali to look for evidence of online material viewed and whom he was in contact with. Britain remains at a severe level of terrorism alert, meaning an attack is highly likely. Ali’s arrest was followed five hours later by arrests in Willesden, north west London. The Guardian understands investigators believe both operations thwarted terrorist attack plots that they fear may have been imminent. A source said of both had attracted “the very highest level of priority” from police and MI5. Despite their belief that two attack plans were disrupted within five hours of each other, at least two other suspected jihadist plots were on Friday being monitored and under investigation. Developments on Thursday were incorporated into a regular review of the alert status, but it was left unchanged. Met police counter-terrorism units and MI5 have been operating at an intense workload for two years with the rise of Islamic State and its call for attacks on the west, with 13 plots thwarted since 2013. Met police deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism, said: “Activity continues around the clock to identify and stop these threats and we are making arrests on a near daily basis.”

A man has been charged with murder in connection with the death of a former Royal Navy officer who was allegedly run over by thieves stealing his car. Mike Samwell, from Chorlton in Manchester who served in the navy for 12 years, died in the early hours of 23 April. Ryan Gibbons, also from Chorlton, has since been charged with murder, burglary and aggravated vehicle-taking. Greater Manchester police say the 29-year-old has been remanded in custody ready to appear before Manchester magistrates court on Saturday. The 35-year-old victim suffered fatal injuries after he is believed to have confronted thieves. The former navy engineer, whose wife Jess was home at the time, was taken to hospital for treatment but died a short time later. Police believe Samwell was run over at least once.  DI Lewis Hughes, of the force’s major incident team, said: “This has been a fast-moving investigation and we have made significant progress since Mike’s murder and have now arrested two more people, who will be questioned by detectives.” A 15-year-old boy was also arrested on suspicion of murder but there is no news as to whether he has also been charged. Two other men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested on suspicion of murder earlier this week but were bailed pending further inquiries. In a statement issued via GMP, Samwell’s family said his death “made a huge hole in our lives that can never be filled”.

A couple working as headteacher and deputy head at a Hampshire primary school rated as outstanding have written to parents saying they are quitting because they are so disillusioned by the direction of education policy. In their letter, Alex and Peter Foggo said they were so profoundly opposed to recent changes in England’s schools that the only morally honest course open to them was to resign from their jobs at Longparish primary school. The couple’s catalogue of complaints ranged from changes to the curriculum and the impact of high-stakes testing on the mental health of very young children, to concern about the reintroduction of grammar schools and the freezing of schools budgets that is leading to widespread cuts. They plan to leave education altogether.     How are the cuts affecting your school? Share your experiences | Sarah Marsh           Read more       “Unfortunately we find that current education policy is in such profound opposition to what we fundamentally believe in, in terms of child welfare and development, as to make our continued work in teaching untenable,” the letter to parents said. “This is not a decision that we have taken lightly, but one that we feel has been forced upon us. Increasingly we have found ourselves having to implement policy with which we fundamentally disagree.” The letter, which went out this week to parents of the 100 children enrolled at the Church of England school, continued: “Recent developments in education have brought our position to a point of personal, professional and ethical crisis, leading to our current decision.” The Foggos, who have been in the teaching profession for almost 50 years combined, said changes to the primary curriculum with its “narrow” focus on reading, spelling, grammar and maths had led to “an increasingly bland and joyless educational diet”, all leading up to tests at the end of years 2 and 6. “The excitement, creativity and wonder that we came into teaching to nurture and encourage have been largely driven out by the rote learning of facts. Combined with this is the increased stress and potential for mental health issues that we see resulting from the pressure placed on young children by these tests.” On cuts to school to funding, an issue that is expected to feature prominently in the general election campaign, the couple said: “The freezing of school budgets, which have meant significant cuts in real terms, have left school leaders with often impossible choices to make. “Which staff do you make redundant? Which subjects do you cut? Which child with an identified special educational need do you select to stop receiving support? “These are not decisions that we believe are in educational or developmental interests of children, nor should school leaders have to be making them in what is one of the wealthiest nations in the world.” The Foggos also condemned Theresa May’s commitment to lift the ban on new grammar schools and extend selection as “socially, morally and educationally wrong”. Education by academic selection, they said, pitted children against each other in “a rat race” from the beginning of their lives. “Pupils will be reduced to competition units, constantly aware of who’s ‘better’ and who’s ‘worse’ in a permanent struggle of tests, exams, scores, ratings and league tables.” Parents of pupils at the school, which serves the villages of Longparish and Hurstbourne Priors, expressed shock that the head and deputy head would not be returning after the summer holiday. James Whiting said: “I just did not see this coming. The school is absolutely outstanding. Mrs Foggo has the deepest commitment to the education of children that I’ve come across in my life. For someone like that to feel that they can no longer run a school is just very worrying.” Another parent, Ingrid Sanderson, said: “I am very sorry the Foggos have decided to leave not only Longparish primary school but education altogether. The education system in this country should not be without teachers of this calibre, yet the current setup seems to be driving them away.” Dinah Nabarro added: “I’m very sorry they feel that the only option is to leave – but I also understand why it’s their only option.” Alex Foggo, who has been head at Longparish for 11 years, told the Guardian: “It’s a very, very sad decision to have to make. I never thought I would leave education before I retired, but parents have been very supportive. They totally understand.”     Put this in your party’s election manifesto           Read more       She said her and her husband’s decision was not shaped by a single factor but an accumulation of concerns. “It’s been one thing after the other, with the changes to the curriculum and assessment and all the trouble that’s caused, and all the stress it’s placed children under … It’s lots of things coming together.” Peter Foggo added: “We’ve had enough of this government’s education policies and what it’s doing to children and teachers.” The couple are among a growing number of teachers, in particular senior school leaders, who are leaving the profession at a time when it is struggling to recruit sufficient new staff. Research published on Friday reported that headteacher retention rates had fallen between 2012 and 2015. A government consultation on the future of primary assessment is currently under way. Asked for a comment, the Department for Education, limited by pre-election purdah, pointed to an earlier commitment not to introduce any more tests in primary school until 2018-19 and the scrapping of proposals to introduce year 7 resits for those who do not achieve the expected level of education at the end of primary school. On funding, the government said it has protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, with school funding at its highest level on record at almost £41bn in 2017-18. On grammar schools, the DfE has previously said bright children from disadvantaged backgrounds thrived at grammars, which is why there were plans for new selective school places to be provided. A team working for the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) found that retention rates at primary schools fell from 94% to 92% and at secondaries from 91% to 87%. Retention rates were lower in schools with low levels of attainment. NFER’s chief executive, Carole Willis, said: “The leadership pipeline is vital to the success of our education system. Given the challenges facing the system it’s more important than ever to understand how headteacher retention rates are changing, and why.”
