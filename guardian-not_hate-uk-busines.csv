https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/29/economy-uncharted-territory-good-bad-news-brexit-referendum-general-election,"Elections have long been won and lost on the state of the economy. So Theresa May’s decision to call a snap poll just as UK growth appears to be slowing has raised eyebrows. But with the Brexit vote predicted to put more pressure on households as the year goes on, the prime minister may well believe this is as good as it gets for economic news.

With less than six weeks to go to the election, a look at the economic backdrop reveals there is both good news and bad for the government.

Good news

Business activity continues to rise

Defying the doomsayers, the predicted post-referendum slump in business activity simply has not happened. Companies are still spending and hiring. Employment is at a record high. Surveys suggest some companies are enjoying a boost from the weak pound as it makes their goods and services more competitive in overseas markets. Meanwhile, the global economy has shown signs of improvement, again helping exporters. But the flipside to the weak pound is higher import costs for businesses, leading food companies and others to complain of pressure on margins and to raise their prices. There are also fears that those reliant on consumer spending will suffer as higher living costs erode Britons’ spending power.

The deficit is coming down

Chancellor Philip Hammond pledged to bring down borrowing and managed to deliver some good news on the deficit last week. Borrowing for the tax year ended in March was £52bn, roughly in line with the £51.7bn predicted by the government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. That was a 28% drop from the previous year and the lowest gap since the eve of the financial crisis, helped by strong tax receipts as the economy continued to grow in the months following the Brexit vote. But details of the most recent public finance figures suggest the government faces tough challenges to bring down the deficit further. March figures pointed to a slowdown in receipts from income tax and from VAT as retail sales were hit by higher prices in the shops.

Stock markets are near record highs

The pound’s heavy losses have been the stock market’s big gain since the Brexit vote. When sterling weakens, it helps the many companies in the FTSE 100 index that report in dollars and those that export from the UK. So while the pound is down around 13% against the dollar since the referendum, the FTSE 100 is up around 14% over the same period. Optimism about Donald Trump’s planned tax reforms and spending spree has also lifted stock markets around the globe, providing a further fillip to the FTSE 100, which set new record highs in March. That provides some feelgood soundbites for campaigning Conservatives. But ultimately, a share index populated by big international mining companies, pharmaceutical giants and banks tells you little about the UK economy.

House prices are steady

Among the dramatic predictions made for the UK ahead of last year’s referendum, the International Monetary Fund warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a property market crash.

In the event, house prices have been steady and are still rising in year-on-year terms. Recently, though, signs have emerged that the market is losing momentum. Nationwide’s closely watched barometer of the market showed the average price of a home fell by 0.4% in April to £207,699, following a 0.3% drop in March. The annual rate of house price growth slowed to 2.6%, the weakest since June 2013.

But that cooling-off is by no means bad news in a market where first-time property buyers have long felt shut out by high prices.

Bad news

The economy has slowed

Economic growth beat expectations following the Brexit vote and the UK finished 2016 as one of the fastest growing advanced economies. However, growth has slowed sharply in the opening months of this year amid signs that rising inflation is hitting consumer spending, a key driver of the British economy.

GDP expanded just 0.3% in the opening three months of 2017, down from growth of 0.7% the previous quarter. It was the weakest performance for a year and missed economists’ forecasts for a more modest slowdown.

Inflation is at its highest for three years and rising

The pound’s drop makes imports to the UK more expensive and that effect has combined with higher crude oil prices to push inflation to 2.3%. That is above the Bank of England’s 2% target and the highest since the autumn of 2013. After more than two years of falls, food prices are now rising again and consumers are starting to notice the increase in their day-to-day living costs. As a result, consumer confidence deteriorated in April, with households becoming more gloomy about the outlook for their personal finances as well as the wider economy, according to polls.

Pay is falling in real terms

Inflation is rising but pay growth appears to be heading in the other direction, with employers unwilling or unable to award big rises. That cocktail is bad news for household finances because it leaves workers worse off in real terms. On the latest official figures, pay fell in real terms in February, marking the first drop in living standards in two and a half years. Regular pay was 1.9% higher than a year earlier while inflation was 2.3%. Looking ahead, economists expect inflation to rise further this year while wage growth remains weak. That bodes ill for an economy so reliant on consumer spending.

Consumers are borrowing more

One of the puzzles for policymakers last year was the resilience of consumer spending in the face of rising inflation. Bank of England governor Mark Carney noted that households appeared to be “entirely looking through Brexit-related uncertainties” but he suggested they were going on a borrowing binge in order to keep up spending levels.

Since his words of warning, there has been more evidence that Britons are indeed increasingly turning to credit cards and personal loans. They are also in a more precarious position when it comes to saving for tougher times ahead. The saving ratio – which estimates the amount of money households have available to save as a percentage of their total disposable income – hit a record low at the end of last year.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/28/spanish-property-market-weak-pound-melts-british-dream-place-in-sun,"Demand from Britons for holiday homes in Spain and Greece has fallen sharply as Brexit uncertainty and the fall in sterling drive house hunters away

Brits abroad? Not so many, it seems. Uncertainty about the future of Britain in Europe and the fall in the value of the pound are taking their toll on the number of UK buyers investing in a little place in the Mediterranean sun.

A report by Spain’s Association of Land and Commercial Registrars last week revealed British demand for second homes in Spain was down nearly 30% on last year’s pre-referendum levels.

In Greece, where property taxes have soared amid the debt-stricken economy and there are lingering fears that the country could yet be ejected from the eurozone, estate agents on some of the more popular Greek islands are reporting an even bigger plunge in the number of Britons looking for homes since the Brexit vote.

“If it’s not 90%, it’s certainly 80%,” says Manolis Mazaros who runs Alpha real estate, one of the oldest property companies in Agios Nicholaos, one of Crete’s most popular resort areas.

Lured by sunshine and sea, about 300,000 British people have made their home in Spain, with more than 600,000 owning second homes, the majority on the costas.

In the wake of the 2008 global banking crisis and Spain’s property crash, sales of Spanish holiday homes to British buyers halved. But from 2012 until the Brexit vote, British purchases were rising on average by 20% per year. Now they have hit reverse again. Last week’s report showed sales to UK buyers for the first quarter of 2017 down from 2,800 last year to 2,000.

The main deterrent for those considering a place in the sun is the weakening pound, which is down 10% compared with the day of the referendum. A €300,000 villa in Murcia which would have cost a UK buyer £229,000 will now cost £254,000. In some areas, such as Barcelona where prices have risen by around 10% in the same period, buyers will be hit even harder.

Most of the second homes on Manolis Mazaros’s books in Crete are newly built villas with small swimming pools worth around €250,000, which will cost a British buyer £20,000 more than in June 2016. But the Brits are staying away from other types of property too.

“The fall in the value of the pound has really affected enquiries,” said Pelagia Papamaxiaki at Creta Houses in Aghia Galini, a small fishing village on Crete’s rural southern coast where more adventurous types have bought in recent years. “People are still calling in but Britons booking appointments has dropped by about 80%,” she said.

Greece, of course, has special problems: aside from the property taxes there are fears of Greece defaulting on its debts, staying in the eurozone and even returning to the drachma. So much so, says Mazaros, that while British buyers are staying away, British owners already in Crete are trying to move out. “About 50% of the English who have homes in this area want to sell them. It’s not just Greeks who can’t afford the taxes who now want to offload properties.”

Alfredo Millá of the Sonneil property agency that covers Alicante and Murcia in south-eastern Spain says the weak pound isn’t the only reason potential buyers are holding back either. “There’s a general air of uncertainty, especially about whether they will be entitled to healthcare,” he says.

Matt Oakley, of Murcia Golf Properties, said 70% of his clients were British and that he hadn’t had buyers pulling out of purchases, although he admitted other concerns. “A lot of people are seeing that their pensions won’t stretch as far as they did and some people who maybe wanted to buy a villa are now having to settle for an apartment.”

Prices are not going down in Murcia, he said, but that was partly due to a new influx of Belgian and Swedish buyers – the latter benefiting from a stronger krona. Elsewhere, more Romanians, Russians, Italian and French buyers are buying into the sangria and siesta lifestyle.

The hardest hit have been British cash buyers looking for a relatively modest sunshine bolthole. “The pound-euro exchange rate has a bigger effect on people at the lower end of the market, in the €200,000-€400,000 price range,” says Chris Clover, head of Panorama Properties in Marbella, southern Spain.

“Those with more money can take advantage of low interest rates to hedge against the weak pound.” Clover said his agency’s average sale price was €1.3m.

Mark Stucklin of Spanish Property Insight said “hot markets” such as Ibiza and Marbella – with a range of wealthy international holiday homebuyers – were still thriving.

The sharp decline in British buyers has not hit Mallorca either, mainly because Germans are the biggest purchasers on the island.

The same is true in Cyprus and Greece. Cyprus has bounced back from its 2013 economic crisis and €10bn IMF bailout. Andreas Tilley at Buy Sell Cyprus, one of the biggest property companies on the island, said: “We saw interest return in 2015 and in the last 45 days it’s been very busy.” Many buyers viewed Cyprus as a good investment, he said, because property prices had plummeted by as much as 35% but were now very much on the rebound.

Poppy Petsa at Corfu homes said there was little sign of British buyers walking away – if they did there were plenty of other potential suitors: “Prices have held and interest has held. Britons are still among the top buyers but Russians, Greek Americans and other Europeans are now also buying properties in a big way.”

Mark Stucklin, at Spanish Property Insight, says that in other holiday areas “the picture I get is one of stable or slightly falling prices”. The prices for ordinary Spanish housing, he says, was “rising much faster than prices for holiday homes and luxury villas”.

Spain is also benefiting from new buyers, including Chinese investors, and agents say there has been a new surge in demand recently from Turkish buyers. The big appeal to Turks concerned about the political climate at home is that since 2013 any non-EU national who buys a home worth more than €500,000 is automatically granted residency.

Alex Vaughan, of property agents Lucas Fox, says: “The Turkish clients we have are buying residential property in the range €500,000 to €1.5m, mainly in Barcelona city but we are seeing growing interest in Madrid and Valencia. So far this year sales to Turkish clients account for about 7.5% of our Barcelona business, so it is definitely the fastest-growing group by nationality.” Half of them, he says, are taking golden visas.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/29/martin-sorrell-sunset-superstar-chief-executives-wpp-executive-pay,"Even WPP’s guiding light is having his pay cut as pressure increases from corporate investors to rein in salaries and bonuses

For more than three decades, Sir Martin Sorrell has run WPP – the world-leading advertising group he built from scratch out of a small maker of wire baskets – with an iron grip. Since jacking in his job as finance chief at Saatchi & Saatchi to start his own business at the very un-dotcom age of 40, Sorrell has built Wire & Plastic Products – the shell company he used as his vehicle for global domination, and which still makes metalware to this day – into a business with a stock market valuation of £22bn.

Investors have been rewarded handsomely: £1,000 invested at WPP’s inception in 1985 would be worth £63,000 today. Sorrell has been rewarded too. Two years ago he took home more than £70m, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history, and over the last five years has pocketed £210m.

For years, investors were placated by WPP’s relentless growth, and questions about the control exerted by its founder were put to one side. “Like Domino’s, WPP continues to deliver,” said the company’s former chairman Philip Lader once, using fast food as an attempt to justify Sorrell’s proprietorial management style and ballooning pay.

The chief executive’s big paydays have been seen as symptomatic of what critics call “Sorrellcentricity” at WPP – the view that Sorrell is autocratic and dominates decision-making – which in turn has led investors to increasingly challenge the governance of the company.

“Sir Martin identifies very closely with WPP as his personal creation,” says Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder advisory service Manifest. “The cult of the superstar chief executive does not create a healthy corporate culture. They’re increasingly the only person we associate with the organisation, its successes or failures. And, in fact, with any of its business decisions at all.”

A change in attitude to corporate pay from the public and investors – and more recently Theresa May’s warning that she would curb boardroom excess – has started to loosen Sorrell’s once unquestioned control. A series of investor rebellions against his pay (the biggest being in 2012, during the “shareholder spring”, when 60% of investors rejected his annual pay package) has forced WPP’s board to cut his remuneration dramatically.

Last week, WPP revealed Sorrell was paid £48m in 2016, the last year of the controversial “Leap” incentive scheme it has been forced to scrap. A new policy capping his annual pay at about £19m had already been agreed. But continued unrest among shareholders led the company to announce it would reduce pay further to a maximum of just over £13m.

This would put him much more in line with his peers. John Wren, the long-serving chief executive of the world’s second-biggest ad group, Omnicom, was paid $26m last year. Michael Roth, chief executive of rival IPG, was paid $18m.

However, the £13m cap won’t come in until 2021, when Sorrell is 76. This raises the spectre of what WPP has called the “succession elephant”, which has now superseded pay as the No 1 issue facing the company and its founder.

“Discussions with WPP have been partly about pay, the quantum, and also very much about succession,” says one major investor in WPP who does not wish to be named. “Partly the reason Sorrell’s pay has been so large is that the company has done very well. But he also got away with negotiating [big] pay packages because of the whole [unanswered] issue of succession.”

Roberto Quarta, who is a year into his job as WPP’s new chairman, said last week that succession planning had become “even more focused and detailed over the last year”. He explained there was an “exceptional team of potential candidates” from WPP’s top management, as well as a “constantly refined list of external candidates”.

Claire Enders, of research firm Enders Analysis, said the perception of Sorrell’s domination is a fallacy. “Martin has a thousand great people across the world in the first tier,” she says. “Year in, year out, [the company] makes WPP a systemic large-scale success rather than the daily product of one man spinning.”

At 72, even with a new baby to deal with, Sorrell’s health and indefatigable work ethic seem to make the issue of age irrelevant. Indeed, gerontocracies are common in medialand: Rupert Murdoch is 86, Barry Diller is 75, as is Sorrell’s erstwhile adversary Maurice Lévy, who this summer will step down as chief executive of Publicis, the world’s third-largest advertising company. IPG’s Roth is 71, while Omnicom’s Wren is the sprightliest of the bunch, at 65.

Nevertheless, a new generation is on the horizon: Lévy’s successor, Arthur Sadoun, is just 46, for example.

One quirk of Sorrell’s relationship with WPP is in his contract. Instead of the standard notice period of 12 months, it says he can terminate his service – or that the company can – “at will”.

Sorrell may only own a few per cent of the company he founded – his stake and that of his family trust is currently worth £427m – but the idea of retirement couldn’t be further from his mind. “Only when they shoot me,” he has said.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/28/personal-insolvencies-debt-pay-inflation,"The number of individuals applying for insolvency jumped to the highest level in almost three years in the first three months of 2017, in a further sign of the mounting financial pressure facing UK households.

Personal insolvencies in England and Wales totalled 24,531 between January and March, up 6.7% on the previous quarter and 15.7% higher than the same period a year earlier. It was the highest number of individual cases since the second quarter of 2014, according to the Insolvency Service, which published the figures.

The rise comes at a challenging time for UK households, as incomes are squeezed by a combination of rising inflation and weak pay growth. The annual inflation rate is 2.3% and expected to rise to 3% in the coming months, as the impact of the weaker pound since the Brexit vote increasingly feeds through to higher shop prices. Meanwhile regular pay growth was just 1.9% in February compared with a year earlier.

Debt charities urge struggling consumers to seek advice early Read more

Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said the insolvency figures were concerning.

“Growing levels of household debt and extra pressure on budgets from inflation are a worry, and we expect this to translate into greater demand for free debt advice over the rest of 2017,” she said.

“We would urge anyone who is already struggling with their finances, or is concerned that they are only one bill away from falling behind, to seek free advice as early as possible.”

At 59%, individual voluntary arrangements accounted for the majority of personal insolvencies in the first quarter, while debt relief orders made up a further 25% and bankruptcies accounted for 16%.

IVAs are arrangements where money owed is shared out between creditors, while DROs are available to people with less than £20,000 of debt who do not own their own home.

Adrian Hyde, the president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, said: “Although borrowing rates remain at record lows, rising inflation and slowing real wage growth will be limiting people’s financial room for manoeuvre.

“Compared with where insolvency numbers were a few years ago, personal insolvency rates are still low and the recent bankruptcy rises have been very small. However, a continued gradual upwards shift may be a sign that the post-recession return of high levels of consumer borrowing and spending is starting to reach its limits.”

He cautioned that the statutory numbers did not give the full picture of personal insolvency in England and Wales, with potentially hundreds of thousands of people on debt management plans who are not covered in the official statistics.

The Insolvency service also reported that the underlying number of corporate insolvencies rose by 4.5% in the first three months of the year, compared with the previous quarter, and 5.3% compared with the same period a year earlier.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/pret-a-manger-charm-offensive-recruit-british-workers-brexit,"Sandwich chain has begun advertising in jobcentres and on social media as it faces up to potential staff shortage

Pret a Manger has embarked on a charm offensive to attract more British workers as it faces up to potential staff shortages after Brexit.

“Traditionally at Pret we just had our recruitment centre and everybody just came to us,” said its chief executive, Clive Schlee. “Now we are preparing for the future by reaching out ourselves.”

The company had relied on its own website, which directs applicants to a recruitment centre in London, but has now started using jobcentres and social media adverts to appeal to British candidates.

The high street chain told a parliamentary committee in March that just one in 50 job applicants were British because its upmarket sandwich shops were not seen by Britons as a “desirable place to work”.

With 65% of its workforce drawn from EU countries other than Britain, Pret’s director of human resources, Andrea Wareham, told MPs it would struggle to find enough staff if it was forced to turn its back on EU nationals after the UK leaves the European Union.

Pret’s attempt to appeal to British school leavers got off to a rocky start last month when the company came under fire after the Guardian reported it was offering 500 teenagers a week of work experience, without pay, to give them a taste of working for the private equity-backed firm. The 16- to 18-year-olds were only being offered free food. However, after a backlash on social media the company relented, with Schlee committing to pay all participants Pret’s hourly starting rate.

In recent months a number of UK employers have voiced concerns about their ability to fill jobs in shops, factories and hospitals if EU migrants decide to return home. Schlee told the Financial Times that Pret had not yet seen a decline in the number of EU workers seeking jobs but it was making a concerted effort to tap “more UK-oriented labour pools”.

Schlee said he was encouraged by government plans to head off recruitment woes for the hospitality industry with a new “barista visa” mooted to allow young European citizens to continue coming to the UK to work in coffee shops and pubs.

His comments came as the company reported a record set of full-year results, with global sales rising 15% to more than £776m last year. The chain’s operating profits increased 11% to more than £93m.

Schlee said the pound’s fall since the Brexit vote had been a double-edged sword as it had boosted UK sales by attracting more tourists but had also forced up the cost of many ingredients. He pledged to keep price rises below inflation, despite seeing spikes in the cost of imported ingredients such as salmon, avocados and crayfish.

Pret has won a legion of loyal customers thanks to its ability to spot the latest food trends, such as avocado, quinoa and chakalaka beans. Pret said the most popular new ingredient over the past year had been coconut, with pots of dairy-free coconut porridge now accounting for one in every five sold in the UK. .

The 30-year-old company was founded by the entrepreneur Julian Metcalfe, who went on to create the Itsu restaurant chain and Metcalfe’s Skinny popcorn.

It is now controlled by private equity firm Bridgepoint but there has been speculation that it is gearing up for a stock market flotation within the next 18 months, with further speculation that bosses are eyeing a listing in New York rather than London. The chain has been a big hit in the US, where sales broke the $200m (£155m) mark for the first time in 2016.",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/27/this-is-not-just-any-online-grocer-ms-plans-food-delivery-service,"Marks & Spencer is to launch an online grocery shopping service this autumn as it looks to cash in on the success of its food halls.

The retailer confirmed that a team of executives was currently drawing up a battle plan ahead of trials this autumn, allowing M&S customers to order food online and have it delivered to their home.

While Britons may have fallen out of love with the M&S clothing ranges in recent years they have been heading in droves to its food aisles as they opt to pick up food for an evening meal rather than do a big weekly shop.

Until now selling food online has not made business sense for M&S as its customers do not typically spend enough on groceries on each visit to make the service profitable.

But the retailer has concluded it can no longer ignore what is the fastest growing section of the UK’s £180bn grocery market as new delivery services, such as AmazonFresh, which allows shoppers to order groceries at lunchtime and get the delivery in time for dinner, revolutionise the way Britain buys food.

Senior executives were informed of the plan at a meeting at Wembley, north-west London, on Wednesday.

“We continue to review food online carefully,” said Steve Rowe, chief executive of M&S. “It has not cost us anything over the last five years by not being online with food. Our customers haven’t moved yet, but they will and we need to ensure that we are ready with the right response. There are unanswered questions over what this means for M&S and we have a team looking at this now with a view to undertaking a soft trial in the autumn.”

M&S already sells a limited selection of party food and alcohol on its website but this would be the first time its wider grocery offer would be made available online.

The high-street store is different from other food retailers as it stocks just 7,000 products compared with 40,000 at most Tesco shops. It also focuses on exclusive own-brand products with only a limited number of household brands available in its stores. It is not clear how the retailer would overcome these hurdles if it were to offer customers a full grocery outlet.

“The economics of food online are not straightforward and it is not something that we are going to rush into until we have substantial customer insight and a better understanding of what is right for M&S and right for our customers,” Rowe added.

Tony Shiret, an independent retail analyst, said Rowe was finally “biting the bullet”. Shiret added: “If they don’t do food online they stand to lose market share to people who do. It’s become a basic expectation from customers.”

However, the analyst said the retailer would face a big challenge trying to make the service profitable. “It is going to be tricky for them because their shopping baskets are small as people use their stores to buy bits and pieces.”

Rowe, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at the M&S Croydon store in south London, and took over as chief executive last April, is seeking to revive the declining profits of the 132-year-old retailer. His biggest job is turning around its clothing arm which under his predecessor, Marc Bolland, relied on heavy discounting to attract shoppers. Rowe is also keen to exploit the success of its food arm.

Last year Rowe announced plans to shut 30 UK stores and convert 45 more into food-only shops as part of a business overhaul that would slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to clothing and face the challenge posed by online shopping.

M&S confirmed the location of six of the affected stores, which included four large “full-line” stores – which sell clothing, homeware and food. They are in Portsmouth, Hampshire, in Slough, Berkshire, Warrington in Cheshire, and Wokingham, Surrey. The retailer also unveiled plans to open another 34 food shops in the next six months.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/29/email-scammers-target-youth-football-team-barclays,"A Reading-based club was duped out of £28,000, but Barclays was only able to recover £8.90. Other volunteer groups and charities should beware

Treasurers of community groups and small charities have been warned to be extremely wary after a youth football club was conned out of more than £28,000 by fraudsters using a fake email scam.

The Reading-based Laurel Park FC says it has had to suspend all planned spending, and the treasurer has resigned, after he was duped into making a series of payments to what he thought were companies undertaking work for the club.

The scam started when he received what looked like a routine email from the chairman asking him to pay £7,000 to a supplier from the club’s Barclays account.

He had expected the request as the club, which operates 27 youth teams from playing fields on the edge of the town, was looking to spend money on its facilities. Only after he had made four payments – amounting to in excess of £28,000 into other Barclays accounts – did it emerge that the emails he’d received were false, and had come from a mocked-up lookalike account.

The case will send a shiver down the spine of anyone who acts as a treasurer for a club or charity.

The conmen, who have previously focused on solicitors and builders, appear to now be picking on those with perhaps lower security measures.

We rely on volunteers to manage the day-to-day running, and our treasurer was just that – a volunteer doing his best

Barclays has washed its hands of the matter and refused to cover the losses, bar the £8.90 it says it was able to recover. The police have been similarly uninterested.

Andy Dykes, the club’s secretary, says the episode has been devastating for those involved. He says the unnamed treasurer has even offered to sell his house to allow him to repay the club, although they are hoping they won’t have to take him up on the offer.

Dykes says the club will survive the loss, albeit on reduced means. The funds that were set to be spent on a much-need upgrade to the sports facilities and equipment, however, are gone.

“Like thousands of other community football clubs we rely on volunteers to manage the day-to-day running, and our treasurer was just that – a volunteer doing his best,” Dykes says.

“He’s a former accountant who, at 82, is still great with figures, although not perhaps the most technically savvy person. He received what looked like a standard email request from our chairman to make a payment, and he did what many of us would have done – he carried it out.”

Club officials were staggered to discover that names used on online payments are completely ignored by the banks, which only use the account and sort code numbers when transferring money.

In this case, the treasurer believed he was sending the money to specifically named building contractors – but it ended up in the fraudster-controlled personal bank accounts.

Dykes, who has seen the emails sent by the fraudsters, says they were very convincing. He is also aware that another local football club was also targetted by the same group.

“We have asked Barclays to investigate how our money has been moved from our account into others at the same bank, and to then disappear. They did manage to recover £8.90, but they can’t explain where the rest has gone, have denied any liability, and refused any help,” Dykes says.

“To be honest, we want to publicise this problem so that other groups don’t go through what we have had to. We have implemented dual sign off on invoices and security checks to avoid any repercussions, and suggest others do the same.”

Guardian Money suggested to Barclays, which has until last season spent about £40m-a-year sponsoring the Premier League, that it might come to the aid of the community football club – one that runs nine girls’ teams and 18 boys’ teams – but this fell on deaf ears.

Barclays told us that all accounts used in this fraud had been opened with appropriate documents, and had been used “normally” for several years. It says: “This scam is a tragic case of criminal theft by a fraudster impersonating the chairman. We acted swiftly to recover any funds that remained in Barclays accounts at the time this was reported.

“Barclays is doing more than any other bank to remind people how to protect themselves from fraud and scams, including major TV and print advertising, and additional efforts with vulnerable customers.

“During the last year we prevented more than £831m of fraud from taking place.”",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/29/flat-value-fell-restaurant-opened-below-planning-policy,"A planning order that permits change of use without consultation can make property values go up in smoke, as one homeowner found to his cost

When my partner and I saw a lovely first-floor Victorian apartment in Harringay, north London, in 2007, we dived in. The flat was large, the period features intact, the area was on the up and the price was good.

The only drawback was that it was above a shop, but this was a minor compromise. It was an A1 premises, which meant it had permission for a limited range of low-impact uses, including hairdressers, travel agents and retail. It was a sandwich bar at the time. Next door was a pub, but we never expected trouble to come from downstairs.

Seven years after buying the flat, the new permitted development rights (PDR) order changed everything. A1 shop units of less than 150 sq m (such as the one beneath us) could now become restaurants for a maximum of two years without neighbouring businesses or residents being consulted (or even informed). After the two years a formal planning review would determine whether the use could continue indefinitely.

It was late 2014. We were now living in south-east Asia and had rented the flat to two professional couples at the time. “Do you know anything about this?” they asked in an unusually curt email. The photo attached to their message was our first introduction to PDR, and it left us numb. It showed a monstrous industrial extraction system bolted to the side of the building above the rear yard. Five metres of thick aluminium ducting now ran directly beneath our bedroom and bathroom windows, and ended with a large exhaust vent beside our balcony.

According to the officer at Haringey council’s planning department, what was once an A1 sandwich bar was to become an A3 restaurant for the next two years – maybe more – and that was that. Two years is a long time when your home suddenly has an industrial kitchen beneath it. Our tenants stuck it out for as long as they could.



“We love living here,” they wrote shortly after the Vietnamese restaurant Hanoi Pho’s opening night in the spring of 2015, “but the cooking smells are in every room.” The problem with our 100-year-old building was that the smells of grilled and stir-fried meats found their way into every nook and cranny.

To show just how flawed the PDR order was, while the change of use was exempt from normal planning laws, the erection of the extraction system (an obvious requirement for a restaurant) was not. After residents’ objections, the retrospective planning application was denied and the entire system was dismantled. But it was a hollow victory. They carried on cooking without it.

According to our tenants, the odours rising up in the rear yard were stomach-churning. “We’re dreading the summer,” they said. “We can’t even open the bathroom window after we’ve had a shower.”

Complaints were lodged, disturbance diaries were kept, a sympathetic local councillor got involved, and more than a year later the restaurant owner was fined for cooking without adequate extraction. After a brief hiatus, mandatory carbon “smell filters” were fitted and the kitchen fired up again. But the damage was done. Our tenants were long gone. We put the flat on the market as soon as they had given us their notice.

“People are concerned about the restaurant,” said our estate agent after just four viewings in as many months. According to his firm’s mortgage adviser, most high-street lenders were turning down applications left and right for flats above A3 units due to the increased risks of fire, noise, cooking smells and, of course, diminished value.

“But it’s not a restaurant,” we pleaded. “It’s only temporary.” And yet there it was. From an initial valuation of £475,000 we gradually dropped the price to £425,000. After months of silence, and mortgage payments on a now vacant flat, we finally received an offer of £400,000. We had to accept it.

“The situation is quite uncommon and extremely unlucky,” said our sympathetic estate agent. “The overall impact [of the restaurant] is massive.”

The sale completed in March 2017, just days before the two-year change-of-use window expired. We were wise not to have waited it out. Hanoi Pho is still there.

Flats above A1 premises may seem like a more affordable option, especially for first-time buyers as we were, but when a shop has the potential to become a restaurant overnight, even if only for a limited period, the smarter move is to look elsewhere. Now, with less cash in our pockets, that’s exactly what we’re doing.

• The owner of Hanoi Pho, Ms Kim Lee, sent the Guardian the following statement: “During part of 2016 the business experienced teething problems, exasperated by the serious illness of Ms Lee’s mother-in-law in Vietnam. As a result, the owner ended up visiting Vietnam, relying on her staff to deal with the business from January to August 2016. Regrettably, at times this caused some public nuisance issues for residents above. Since September 2016 Ms Lee and her husband spend most of their time at the premises and a part-time manager was appointed. In order to eradicate odours, in September the menu was amended twice, reducing the cooking element. The premises began to operate as a cafe with limited cooking. In addition, out of respect to the residents above, Ms Lee invested a large amount of money on installing an RVH 1200 recirculation extraction hood internal system to guarantee full odour eradication. All improvements were made in close dialogue and with full co-operation of the council. Due to the improvements, the premises’ licence was granted in March 2017.

“Ms Lee is a responsible trader and pays due regard to residents. That’s why she closes the business at 11pm. She is very sorry that the January-August 2016 period caused some nuisance to the residents who lived above.”

Wary lenders steer clear

The change to permitted development rights (PDR) may encourage surveyors to down-value flats above shops, and could even make them unmortgageable, say property experts.

Richard Sexton, director of e.surv, Britain’s biggest firm of valuers, says: “Since 2015, PDR allows existing A1 or A2 (that is to say financial or professional service offices) to be changed to restaurant use. Regrettably, the [above] experience is far from unique and the case history does a very good job highlighting why property affected is often much less attractive to purchasers, and hence less valuable. More importantly, many lenders will also be unhappy to lend on such homes, [so] vendors are often forced to consider a cash sale. Cash investors will typically look for a discount and valuers will therefore reflect this in their opinion.”

Ray Boulger, of mortgage broker John Charcol, says: “Your reader highlights a major defect, which I suspect the government either overlooked or didn’t appreciate all the implications of, in the PDR order. Some lenders have a blanket policy in their criteria of not lending on flats above commercial premises, but in practice some will be flexible if the flat is in a good location and depending what the commercial premises are. As well as restaurants, takeaways and pubs, lenders don’t like dry cleaners and nightclubs: any business that may cause a noise, or smell, or any other type of nuisance.

“If all, or even most, lenders who currently consider lending on flats above A1 premises were to change their policy, this would have a significant knock-on effect on the value of all flats above A1 premises.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/29/triodos-ethical-bank-replace-co-op-bank,"Triodos is launching its first current account in Britain and promises your money will only ever be handled sustainably. So should you go Dutch?

Perhaps you are looking for a more ethical home for your current account cash. Or maybe you are a Co-operative Bank customer who is considering closing your account following its well-publicised troubles.

If either of those sound like you – or perhaps you simply don’t want to give your money to one of the “big four” banks – then as of this week there’s a new option. Triodos, which bills itself as “Europe’s leading sustainable bank”, has taken the wraps off its first-ever British personal current account.

The bank is allowing people to register their interest, and in June it will begin sending out invitations to those who have registered to apply for an account.

Founded in the Netherlands in 1980, Triodos set up an office in the UK in 1995 and has been offering savings and investments here for some years. It now has almost 50,000 UK customers, and more than half a million across Europe. It offers current accounts in the Netherlands, Spain and Germany, and says it is now finally ready to launch a full banking service in Britain.

Triodos’s USP is that it only lends money to organisations and projects that are “making a positive difference to society”, whether’s that’s socially, culturally or environmentally. It publishes details of every loan it makes via its website, and its borrowers have included chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s River Cottage HQ, and Worthy Farm, home to the Glastonbury festival. “We want people to really think about what their bank is doing with their money. Money doesn’t have to be invested in the arms trade, fossil fuels and tobacco – it can be used to do good things that help build the society we want to live in,” says the bank.

Triodos’s green credentials are impeccable, but there is a stumbling block: all customers have to pay a £3 monthly fee (ie £36 a year) for the current account service. That may well prove to be a deal-breaker for some, particularly as the bank isn’t offering any upfront financial incentives to tempt people to sign up.

Triodos is entering a hugely competitive market. Just two days ago M&S Bank announced that new customers who switch to one of its current accounts – there is one with no monthly fee, and one costing £10 a month – will now get up to £185 to spend in M&S. They initially receive a £125 gift card, which will then be topped up with £5 each month they deposit £1,000-plus in their account during the first year. Meanwhile, Halifax has a no-monthly-fee Reward account, where you get a £3 payment each month you pay in £750 or more, plus a £75 switching inducement. This week the Halifax said official figures showed it was “the most switched-to bank on the high street”.

So what is Triodos offering? This is a current account that will work in all the ways you would expect, and can be opened by any UK resident aged 18 or over who meets the eligibility criteria. The account is operated online and via a mobile app. Triodos is not providing a telephone banking service, though it will offer phone-based support, and while it has offices, there are no high street branches.

The account comes with a contactless Mastercard debit card made from PLA, a “natural plastic”, which can be used to make payments, cashpoint withdrawals etc. You can request a chequebook and apply for an overdraft, though the £2,000 maximum is lower than that offered by many other banks. The authorised overdraft rate is 18% EAR, which is competitive but not top of the market. Triodos won’t charge anything extra for setting up and using an overdraft.

Someone banking with Triodos with an authorised overdraft of £600 used for seven days each month would incur charges of £23.06 a year, compared with £84 at Santander and Halifax, and £97.24 with NatWest/Royal Bank of Scotland.

The bank will not allow unauthorised overdrafts – it will simply not pay items when there are insufficient funds. Unpaid items will incur a £5 charge, with a maximum monthly charge of £50.

Triodos claims that for many years people have been able to make positive choices about things such as food, energy and transport, but not banking. The Co-operative Bank might have something to say about that – it is the only high street bank with a customer-led ethical policy covering a range of issues from the environment to animal welfare. However, Co-op Bank put itself up for sale in February, four years after it nearly collapsed and had to be bailed out by hedge funds, and there has been speculation that it may have to be broken up. So Triodos is likely to pick up at least a few Co-op Bank leavers. Nevertheless, the Co-op is still very much open to new customers: it is offering £110 to people who move to its no-monthly-fee current account via the industry’s switching service.

So how does Triodos justify that £3 monthly fee? Huw Davies, its head of retail banking, says it believes it is fairer that everyone should pay a “modest” monthly charge to cover the cost of providing a banking service. “There is no such thing as free banking because someone else always pays. ‘Free’ accounts are usually subsidised with high penalty charges and hidden fees, so the most vulnerable customers, or those making a rare miscalculation with the household finances, end up paying an exorbitant price.”

Is Triodos safe?

Some people may feel uneasy about signing up with a bank headquartered in the Netherlands when Britain is poised to leave the EU.

While most banks offering products to consumers have a UK banking licence and £85,000 Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protection, European banks are allowed to operate here under their home country’s regulations in a system known as passporting. This means that consumers banking with a such a bank are covered by its home country’s compensation scheme and not the UK’s.

Triodos Bank in the UK is part of Triodos Bank NV, based in the Netherlands. That means it is covered by the Dutch deposit-guarantee scheme, which guarantees up to €100,000 (£84,450) per person. For joint accounts held in the names of two people it is €200,000. As an extra safeguard, if a credit balance is directly related to a house purchase or sale, the maximum guaranteed is €500,000. This applies for three months after the money is paid into the account.

Data provider Moneyfacts has previously said that while consumers can be reassured that under European law, money held with European banks is covered by the compensation scheme of the bank’s home country, “they should bear in mind that in the event of a crisis they face language and exchange rate issues”.

Incidentally, Triodos says: “We are absolutely committed to remaining in the UK.”

Sally Murrall-Smith is one of those planning to sign up for Triodos’s current account. The 38-year-old who lives in Totnes, Devon, says she has always been interested in the environment. She has been a NatWest customer for decades but intends to jump ship as soon as she is able.

“I want my money to be used to drive positive change,” says Murrall-Smith, who is the mother of two boys aged three and one. “Triodos funds infrastructure projects such as renewable energy and low-carbon social housing, which I see as paramount. Moreover, I love the fact it’s so transparent – I can easily find out where my money is going.”

Murrall-Smith works for Totnes Renewable Energy Society (Tresoc), a member-owned community organisation, and first came across Triodos two years ago when she invested in a bond issue to finance a hydropower scheme on the Totnes weir. This was developed by a company called Dart Renewables and financed through the bank. “I was thrilled to be able to invest in such a fantastic renewable energy project on my doorstep, a project that made social, economic and environmental sense,” she says. Shortly after that she got a job with Tresoc, which is developing a community-owned hydro power plant in nearby Staverton.

She likes the fact that Triodos supports organisations looking to develop local green energy supplies, enabling them to raise capital and finance projects that ordinarily wouldn’t get built.

Murrall-Smith says that in the past she could have done more to find a bank suited to her values, but that banks haven’t been transparent.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/29/old-paper-five-pound-note-end-date-may,"There is as much as £800m worth still in circulation, but from Friday they will no longer be legal tender

In the biggest changeover in currency since decimalisation. On Friday 5 May the paper £5 note will no longer be legal tender – yet as recently as the start of April there were still 160m of them in Britain’s wallets, money boxes and (if you’re lucky) under the sofa.

Already shops across the country are beginning to display “£5.05.05” posters telling people that the end of the cotton-paper note, first issued in its current shape and size in 1990, is nigh. After that date no retailers are obliged to accept them, though that doesn’t mean they become worthless overnight.

As the Bank of England is keen to point out, its notes retain their face value “for all time”. Some retailers, banks and building societies may choose to accept them after 5 May, entirely at their discretion. Eventually they will pull the shutters down.

But the bit on the note that says “I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of five pounds”, signed by current chief cashier, Victoria Cleland, remains in place. If you find a stash of fivers in a few years you won’t be able to spend them in the shops, but will have the right to demand that the Bank of England swaps them for new ones.

In Scotland, leading banks started issuing their own polymer fivers last autumn, and since then they have gradually been withdrawing the paper version – however, there is no specific published final end date. (There are no plans by note issuers in Northern Ireland to switch to polymer, though one, Northern Bank – now Danske Bank – was the first in the UK to issue a polymer fiver way back in 1999.)

Oddly enough, you may in future end up eating the remnants of the old £5 notes. Those returned to the Bank of England will be recycled and turned into fertiliser. “This is done using a composting treatment and the end product is used as a soil improver for agriculture,” says the Bank.

Should you put an old fiver aside in the hope that one day it could be worth something to collectors? Sadly not. Between 2003-04 and 2015-16, 1,898m were issued, so they are unlikely to ever gain rarity value.

Simon Narbeth of notes dealer Colin Narbeth & Son says only £5 notes with the HA01 number, issued in 2005, have any value to collectors. A short production run had serial numbers that rubbed off, and they now change hands for around £20. Notes with very early serial numbers also command a premium, although we are talking about hundreds, not thousands.

Perfect mint condition 10 shilling notes, withdrawn in the 1970s and replaced by the 50p coin, are only worth £2, says Narbeth, and used ones go for just 50p. That’s the same as the Bank of England will pay if you present one at its Threadneedle Street office.

The introduction of the polymer £5 notes has been regarded as a success – barring the battle with vegans (see below). The polymer £10 note (also containing traces of animal fat) is set for launch in September this year. It will feature Jane Austen on the reverse, and the Bank is using the 200th anniversary of the writer’s death on 18 July to officially unveil it.

The new tenner will be smaller than the current one – but larger than the new fiver. The size ratios will be the same as those between the old paper fiver and tenner.

Back to the 1990s



The outgoing fiver, technically known as the series E note, first appeared in June 1990, although the note that it replaced (featuring the Duke of Wellington on the reverse) didn’t stop being legal tender until the end of November 1991, writes Miles Brignall.

Back then five pounds had sufficient buying power to ­purchase three pints of beer, and two of loaves of bread on the way back from the pub. Petrol cost just 40p a litre, ­meaning it cost about £18 to fill up an average family car.

In 1991, those hoping to “work, rest and play” could have bought 19 Mars bars (at 26p each) with their £5. The latest 2017 polymer note, by comparison, will net you just eight. A pint of milk, meanwhile, was relatively expensive at 32p when compared with the 45p you will typically pay at a supermarket today.

If you were lucky enough to get £5 pocket money back then, you could buy the hot toy of 1991 – a Teenage Mutant Hero Turtle figure which cost £4.99 from Argos. If you were more of a Simpsons fan, a fiver bought you the latest branded backpack.

Those with a good memory will recall that 1991 wasn’t a happy year financially. Inflation was running at 9%, and at the start of the year interest rates were 13.375% (though by September 1991 they’d fallen to 10.375%). The chancellor, Norman Lamont, increased VAT from 15% to 17.5%. But the average house price was just £73,000.

It was arguably a tough year for music fans: by far the biggest-selling single of 1991 was (Everything I Do) I Do It for You. The Bryan Adams song from the soundtrack to the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves spent 16 weeks at number one.

The 1990-91 £5 note, which depicted George Stephenson, inventor of the Rocket steam train, had an upgrade in 1993, and in 2002 Stephenson was replaced by social reformer Elizabeth Fry. It is the notes featuring Fry that are now being phased out.

The man behind the vegan protests against traces of animal fat found in the polymer £5 note – and which will also be in the new £10 note – says he is preparing to take legal action against the Bank of England, writes Patrick Collinson.

It emerged in November that there is an “extremely small amount” of tallow, a substance made from animal fat, in the polymer pellets used in the base substrate of the polymer £5 note. Doug Maw, 48, and at the time a hotel worker in Keswick, launched a petition calling for the use of it to be stopped. It has attracted more than 136,000 signatories so far, with support from vegans, ­vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others demanding the bank halt the use of animal products in the currency.



The Bank of England says it is considering plans to replace the animal fat in the notes, but risks running straight into another row, because the most practical alternative to animal fat, it says, is palm oil – and that is likely to spark protests from environmentalists unless it can be sustainably sourced.

Maw says he will take a decision about a crowdfunded legal action next month. “We will see what the Bank decides. I have a meeting with my legal team and we will be examining if there is a case for breach of human rights if they carry on producing notes with tallow.

“Some people say this is a trivial issue, but when you are a vegan you don’t choose to accept a meal in a restaurant with just a little bit of chicken. I don’t have to eat chicken, I don’t have to buy anything with animal products. So why do I have to use notes with animal products?”

If he is dispensed a polymer £5 note from a machine, Maw says he marches into a bank to have it exchanged for £1 coins, and will do the same when the £10 note comes into circulation in September.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/28/uk-house-prices-april-brexit-inflation-wages-nationwide,"Average price of a home fell by 0.4% to £207,699 as rising inflation and low wage growth hit home, says Nationwide

UK house prices fell for a second month in a row in April in a sign that the squeeze on family incomes is starting to weigh on the property market.

The average price of a home fell by 0.4% over the month to £207,699, following a 0.3% drop in March, according to Nationwide. It was the first time that prices fell in two consecutive months in nearly five years and drove down the annual rate of house price growth to 2.6%, the weakest since June 2013.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the slowdown could reflect the broader backdrop for consumer finances, which are coming under increasing pressure from a combination of rising inflation and weak wage growth.



London rents fall sharply as monthly bill drops across UK Read more

“While monthly figures can be volatile, the recent softening in price growth may be a further indication that households are starting to react to the emerging squeeze on real incomes or to affordability pressures in key parts of the country,” Gardner said.

He said the outlook for the property market over the coming months was particularly difficult to predict because of the upcoming general election and uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit negotiations.

“The economic outlook is unusually uncertain, and housing market trends will depend crucially on developments in the wider economy,” he said.

Nationwide said housing affordability was a key issue for potential homebuyers, with a typical house price currently at 6.1 times average earnings, well above the long run average of 4.3 times earnings. The lender expects house price growth to more than halve in 2017 to about 2%, from 4.5% in 2016.

Consumers have been the main driver of UK economic growth since the financial crisis but there are mounting signs that the appetite for spending is beginning to wane.

Retail sales are falling, and households have been dipping into their savings to maintain spending in the face of rising prices in the shops. Inflation is currently at 2.3% and expected to rise to 3% in the coming months as the weak pound since the Brexit vote feeds through to the cost of living.

Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said that against this backdrop house prices were likely to come under increasing pressure.

“We suspect markedly weakening consumer fundamentals, likely mounting caution over making major spending decisions, and elevated house price to earnings ratios will weigh down further on housing market activity and house prices over the coming months,” he said.



However, he said that a housing crash is unlikely because the shortage of homes coming on to the market will limit the extent to which prices fall.

The weakening consumer backdrop was reflected in the latest high street lending figures from the British Bankers’ Association, which showed growth in consumer lending slowed to 6.1% in March from 6.5% in February.

The fall was due to slower growth in personal loans, credit card borrowing, and overdrafts.

“In March, annual growth in consumer borrowing from the main high street banks slowed, perhaps mirroring the dip seen in retail sales volumes as price rises appear to have started biting into consumers’ spending,” said Eric Leenders, the BBA’s managing director for retail banking.

Mortgage approvals for house purchase were 2.8% lower in March than in February, at 41,061.

Hansen Lu, property economist at Capital Economics, said the BBA data and the latest Nationwide house prices index made sense together.

“Mortgage approvals for house purchase fell in March and that subdued demand was, in turn, reflected by a modest dip in house prices in April. The main reason for this slowdown is high house prices, suggesting that prices are unlikely to accelerate again this year.”

London has seen a “sharp fall” in rents over the last 12 months, with the average monthly amount paid dropping from £1,297 a year ago to £1,203 in March 2017, said Your Move, which publishes a regular buy-to-let index. In March alone, typical rents in the capital fell 6%, it added.



The company also reported a decline of 3.7% in rents in south-east England during the month of March, as well as smaller falls in several other regions across the UK.



UK average annual rents fall for first time in six years Read more

Your Move said the falls reflect the fact many people looking for rental properties had switched their focus away from London. Nevertheless, the capital remained the most expensive place to rent a property, the company added. The figures, which are based on an analysis of around 20,000 properties in England and Wales, show that the average rent in England and Wales was £800 in March.



Your Move added that the east of England was now the most expensive place to rent a property outside London, at an average of £883 a month, putting it ahead of the south-east (£845). Typical rents in the east of England have risen 7.4% in a year.



The figures broadly tally with data from Countrywide, the UK’s biggest estate and lettings agency, which said in March that rents in Britain recorded their first annual drop for six years.



Countrywide said the buying frenzy ahead of the hike in stamp duty last year pushed up the supply of new homes for letting by 10%, but tenant demand has been falling, particularly in London, possibly as a result of Brexit.



The company also found that rents were falling fastest in the capital, with its figures suggesting a 4.3% drop in a year. In London, the supply of new homes to let was up 18%, it said, but the number of tenants looking for properties had fallen by 3%.



The pace of house price increases has also slowed across Britain, according to the most recent Halifax price index. It said prices in the three months to March were just 0.1% higher than in the previous quarter, adding that the annual rate of growth fell to 3.8% from February’s 5.1%.

A separate index from Nationwide building society also found that prices fell nationally in March. It said the average price of a home fell 0.3% to £207,308 following a 0.6% rise in prices in February.



Some of the frothiest parts of the central London property market have recorded the biggest price falls over the past year. Data from LSL Property Services suggested that the average price of a home in the City of London fell by 10.5% in the year to February 2017, knocking nearly £100,000 off the average price in the district at the heart of Britain’s financial services industry.



Your Move also said that the proportion of tenants in arrears increased month on month. In March 2017, the percentage of households in arrears was 9.05%, higher than the 8.1% seen a month earlier.

Despite this, the company claimed that the long-term trends “continue to be encouraging”. The proportion of tenants in arrears remains below the all-time high of 14.6% recorded in early 2010.",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/29/flat-value-fell-restaurant-opened-below-planning-policy,"A planning order that permits change of use without consultation can make property values go up in smoke, as one homeowner found to his cost

When my partner and I saw a lovely first-floor Victorian apartment in Harringay, north London, in 2007, we dived in. The flat was large, the period features intact, the area was on the up and the price was good.

The only drawback was that it was above a shop, but this was a minor compromise. It was an A1 premises, which meant it had permission for a limited range of low-impact uses, including hairdressers, travel agents and retail. It was a sandwich bar at the time. Next door was a pub, but we never expected trouble to come from downstairs.

Seven years after buying the flat, the new permitted development rights (PDR) order changed everything. A1 shop units of less than 150 sq m (such as the one beneath us) could now become restaurants for a maximum of two years without neighbouring businesses or residents being consulted (or even informed). After the two years a formal planning review would determine whether the use could continue indefinitely.

It was late 2014. We were now living in south-east Asia and had rented the flat to two professional couples at the time. “Do you know anything about this?” they asked in an unusually curt email. The photo attached to their message was our first introduction to PDR, and it left us numb. It showed a monstrous industrial extraction system bolted to the side of the building above the rear yard. Five metres of thick aluminium ducting now ran directly beneath our bedroom and bathroom windows, and ended with a large exhaust vent beside our balcony.

According to the officer at Haringey council’s planning department, what was once an A1 sandwich bar was to become an A3 restaurant for the next two years – maybe more – and that was that. Two years is a long time when your home suddenly has an industrial kitchen beneath it. Our tenants stuck it out for as long as they could.



“We love living here,” they wrote shortly after the Vietnamese restaurant Hanoi Pho’s opening night in the spring of 2015, “but the cooking smells are in every room.” The problem with our 100-year-old building was that the smells of grilled and stir-fried meats found their way into every nook and cranny.

To show just how flawed the PDR order was, while the change of use was exempt from normal planning laws, the erection of the extraction system (an obvious requirement for a restaurant) was not. After residents’ objections, the retrospective planning application was denied and the entire system was dismantled. But it was a hollow victory. They carried on cooking without it.

According to our tenants, the odours rising up in the rear yard were stomach-churning. “We’re dreading the summer,” they said. “We can’t even open the bathroom window after we’ve had a shower.”

Complaints were lodged, disturbance diaries were kept, a sympathetic local councillor got involved, and more than a year later the restaurant owner was fined for cooking without adequate extraction. After a brief hiatus, mandatory carbon “smell filters” were fitted and the kitchen fired up again. But the damage was done. Our tenants were long gone. We put the flat on the market as soon as they had given us their notice.

“People are concerned about the restaurant,” said our estate agent after just four viewings in as many months. According to his firm’s mortgage adviser, most high-street lenders were turning down applications left and right for flats above A3 units due to the increased risks of fire, noise, cooking smells and, of course, diminished value.

“But it’s not a restaurant,” we pleaded. “It’s only temporary.” And yet there it was. From an initial valuation of £475,000 we gradually dropped the price to £425,000. After months of silence, and mortgage payments on a now vacant flat, we finally received an offer of £400,000. We had to accept it.

“The situation is quite uncommon and extremely unlucky,” said our sympathetic estate agent. “The overall impact [of the restaurant] is massive.”

The sale completed in March 2017, just days before the two-year change-of-use window expired. We were wise not to have waited it out. Hanoi Pho is still there.

Flats above A1 premises may seem like a more affordable option, especially for first-time buyers as we were, but when a shop has the potential to become a restaurant overnight, even if only for a limited period, the smarter move is to look elsewhere. Now, with less cash in our pockets, that’s exactly what we’re doing.

• The owner of Hanoi Pho, Ms Kim Lee, sent the Guardian the following statement: “During part of 2016 the business experienced teething problems, exasperated by the serious illness of Ms Lee’s mother-in-law in Vietnam. As a result, the owner ended up visiting Vietnam, relying on her staff to deal with the business from January to August 2016. Regrettably, at times this caused some public nuisance issues for residents above. Since September 2016 Ms Lee and her husband spend most of their time at the premises and a part-time manager was appointed. In order to eradicate odours, in September the menu was amended twice, reducing the cooking element. The premises began to operate as a cafe with limited cooking. In addition, out of respect to the residents above, Ms Lee invested a large amount of money on installing an RVH 1200 recirculation extraction hood internal system to guarantee full odour eradication. All improvements were made in close dialogue and with full co-operation of the council. Due to the improvements, the premises’ licence was granted in March 2017.

“Ms Lee is a responsible trader and pays due regard to residents. That’s why she closes the business at 11pm. She is very sorry that the January-August 2016 period caused some nuisance to the residents who lived above.”

Wary lenders steer clear

The change to permitted development rights (PDR) may encourage surveyors to down-value flats above shops, and could even make them unmortgageable, say property experts.

Richard Sexton, director of e.surv, Britain’s biggest firm of valuers, says: “Since 2015, PDR allows existing A1 or A2 (that is to say financial or professional service offices) to be changed to restaurant use. Regrettably, the [above] experience is far from unique and the case history does a very good job highlighting why property affected is often much less attractive to purchasers, and hence less valuable. More importantly, many lenders will also be unhappy to lend on such homes, [so] vendors are often forced to consider a cash sale. Cash investors will typically look for a discount and valuers will therefore reflect this in their opinion.”

Ray Boulger, of mortgage broker John Charcol, says: “Your reader highlights a major defect, which I suspect the government either overlooked or didn’t appreciate all the implications of, in the PDR order. Some lenders have a blanket policy in their criteria of not lending on flats above commercial premises, but in practice some will be flexible if the flat is in a good location and depending what the commercial premises are. As well as restaurants, takeaways and pubs, lenders don’t like dry cleaners and nightclubs: any business that may cause a noise, or smell, or any other type of nuisance.

“If all, or even most, lenders who currently consider lending on flats above A1 premises were to change their policy, this would have a significant knock-on effect on the value of all flats above A1 premises.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/29/triodos-ethical-bank-replace-co-op-bank,"Triodos is launching its first current account in Britain and promises your money will only ever be handled sustainably. So should you go Dutch?

Perhaps you are looking for a more ethical home for your current account cash. Or maybe you are a Co-operative Bank customer who is considering closing your account following its well-publicised troubles.

If either of those sound like you – or perhaps you simply don’t want to give your money to one of the “big four” banks – then as of this week there’s a new option. Triodos, which bills itself as “Europe’s leading sustainable bank”, has taken the wraps off its first-ever British personal current account.

The bank is allowing people to register their interest, and in June it will begin sending out invitations to those who have registered to apply for an account.

Founded in the Netherlands in 1980, Triodos set up an office in the UK in 1995 and has been offering savings and investments here for some years. It now has almost 50,000 UK customers, and more than half a million across Europe. It offers current accounts in the Netherlands, Spain and Germany, and says it is now finally ready to launch a full banking service in Britain.

Triodos’s USP is that it only lends money to organisations and projects that are “making a positive difference to society”, whether’s that’s socially, culturally or environmentally. It publishes details of every loan it makes via its website, and its borrowers have included chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s River Cottage HQ, and Worthy Farm, home to the Glastonbury festival. “We want people to really think about what their bank is doing with their money. Money doesn’t have to be invested in the arms trade, fossil fuels and tobacco – it can be used to do good things that help build the society we want to live in,” says the bank.

Triodos’s green credentials are impeccable, but there is a stumbling block: all customers have to pay a £3 monthly fee (ie £36 a year) for the current account service. That may well prove to be a deal-breaker for some, particularly as the bank isn’t offering any upfront financial incentives to tempt people to sign up.

Triodos is entering a hugely competitive market. Just two days ago M&S Bank announced that new customers who switch to one of its current accounts – there is one with no monthly fee, and one costing £10 a month – will now get up to £185 to spend in M&S. They initially receive a £125 gift card, which will then be topped up with £5 each month they deposit £1,000-plus in their account during the first year. Meanwhile, Halifax has a no-monthly-fee Reward account, where you get a £3 payment each month you pay in £750 or more, plus a £75 switching inducement. This week the Halifax said official figures showed it was “the most switched-to bank on the high street”.

So what is Triodos offering? This is a current account that will work in all the ways you would expect, and can be opened by any UK resident aged 18 or over who meets the eligibility criteria. The account is operated online and via a mobile app. Triodos is not providing a telephone banking service, though it will offer phone-based support, and while it has offices, there are no high street branches.

The account comes with a contactless Mastercard debit card made from PLA, a “natural plastic”, which can be used to make payments, cashpoint withdrawals etc. You can request a chequebook and apply for an overdraft, though the £2,000 maximum is lower than that offered by many other banks. The authorised overdraft rate is 18% EAR, which is competitive but not top of the market. Triodos won’t charge anything extra for setting up and using an overdraft.

Someone banking with Triodos with an authorised overdraft of £600 used for seven days each month would incur charges of £23.06 a year, compared with £84 at Santander and Halifax, and £97.24 with NatWest/Royal Bank of Scotland.

The bank will not allow unauthorised overdrafts – it will simply not pay items when there are insufficient funds. Unpaid items will incur a £5 charge, with a maximum monthly charge of £50.

Triodos claims that for many years people have been able to make positive choices about things such as food, energy and transport, but not banking. The Co-operative Bank might have something to say about that – it is the only high street bank with a customer-led ethical policy covering a range of issues from the environment to animal welfare. However, Co-op Bank put itself up for sale in February, four years after it nearly collapsed and had to be bailed out by hedge funds, and there has been speculation that it may have to be broken up. So Triodos is likely to pick up at least a few Co-op Bank leavers. Nevertheless, the Co-op is still very much open to new customers: it is offering £110 to people who move to its no-monthly-fee current account via the industry’s switching service.

So how does Triodos justify that £3 monthly fee? Huw Davies, its head of retail banking, says it believes it is fairer that everyone should pay a “modest” monthly charge to cover the cost of providing a banking service. “There is no such thing as free banking because someone else always pays. ‘Free’ accounts are usually subsidised with high penalty charges and hidden fees, so the most vulnerable customers, or those making a rare miscalculation with the household finances, end up paying an exorbitant price.”

Is Triodos safe?

Some people may feel uneasy about signing up with a bank headquartered in the Netherlands when Britain is poised to leave the EU.

While most banks offering products to consumers have a UK banking licence and £85,000 Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protection, European banks are allowed to operate here under their home country’s regulations in a system known as passporting. This means that consumers banking with a such a bank are covered by its home country’s compensation scheme and not the UK’s.

Triodos Bank in the UK is part of Triodos Bank NV, based in the Netherlands. That means it is covered by the Dutch deposit-guarantee scheme, which guarantees up to €100,000 (£84,450) per person. For joint accounts held in the names of two people it is €200,000. As an extra safeguard, if a credit balance is directly related to a house purchase or sale, the maximum guaranteed is €500,000. This applies for three months after the money is paid into the account.

Data provider Moneyfacts has previously said that while consumers can be reassured that under European law, money held with European banks is covered by the compensation scheme of the bank’s home country, “they should bear in mind that in the event of a crisis they face language and exchange rate issues”.

Incidentally, Triodos says: “We are absolutely committed to remaining in the UK.”

Sally Murrall-Smith is one of those planning to sign up for Triodos’s current account. The 38-year-old who lives in Totnes, Devon, says she has always been interested in the environment. She has been a NatWest customer for decades but intends to jump ship as soon as she is able.

“I want my money to be used to drive positive change,” says Murrall-Smith, who is the mother of two boys aged three and one. “Triodos funds infrastructure projects such as renewable energy and low-carbon social housing, which I see as paramount. Moreover, I love the fact it’s so transparent – I can easily find out where my money is going.”

Murrall-Smith works for Totnes Renewable Energy Society (Tresoc), a member-owned community organisation, and first came across Triodos two years ago when she invested in a bond issue to finance a hydropower scheme on the Totnes weir. This was developed by a company called Dart Renewables and financed through the bank. “I was thrilled to be able to invest in such a fantastic renewable energy project on my doorstep, a project that made social, economic and environmental sense,” she says. Shortly after that she got a job with Tresoc, which is developing a community-owned hydro power plant in nearby Staverton.

She likes the fact that Triodos supports organisations looking to develop local green energy supplies, enabling them to raise capital and finance projects that ordinarily wouldn’t get built.

Murrall-Smith says that in the past she could have done more to find a bank suited to her values, but that banks haven’t been transparent.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/29/old-paper-five-pound-note-end-date-may,"There is as much as £800m worth still in circulation, but from Friday they will no longer be legal tender

In the biggest changeover in currency since decimalisation. On Friday 5 May the paper £5 note will no longer be legal tender – yet as recently as the start of April there were still 160m of them in Britain’s wallets, money boxes and (if you’re lucky) under the sofa.

Already shops across the country are beginning to display “£5.05.05” posters telling people that the end of the cotton-paper note, first issued in its current shape and size in 1990, is nigh. After that date no retailers are obliged to accept them, though that doesn’t mean they become worthless overnight.

As the Bank of England is keen to point out, its notes retain their face value “for all time”. Some retailers, banks and building societies may choose to accept them after 5 May, entirely at their discretion. Eventually they will pull the shutters down.

But the bit on the note that says “I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of five pounds”, signed by current chief cashier, Victoria Cleland, remains in place. If you find a stash of fivers in a few years you won’t be able to spend them in the shops, but will have the right to demand that the Bank of England swaps them for new ones.

In Scotland, leading banks started issuing their own polymer fivers last autumn, and since then they have gradually been withdrawing the paper version – however, there is no specific published final end date. (There are no plans by note issuers in Northern Ireland to switch to polymer, though one, Northern Bank – now Danske Bank – was the first in the UK to issue a polymer fiver way back in 1999.)

Oddly enough, you may in future end up eating the remnants of the old £5 notes. Those returned to the Bank of England will be recycled and turned into fertiliser. “This is done using a composting treatment and the end product is used as a soil improver for agriculture,” says the Bank.

Should you put an old fiver aside in the hope that one day it could be worth something to collectors? Sadly not. Between 2003-04 and 2015-16, 1,898m were issued, so they are unlikely to ever gain rarity value.

Simon Narbeth of notes dealer Colin Narbeth & Son says only £5 notes with the HA01 number, issued in 2005, have any value to collectors. A short production run had serial numbers that rubbed off, and they now change hands for around £20. Notes with very early serial numbers also command a premium, although we are talking about hundreds, not thousands.

Perfect mint condition 10 shilling notes, withdrawn in the 1970s and replaced by the 50p coin, are only worth £2, says Narbeth, and used ones go for just 50p. That’s the same as the Bank of England will pay if you present one at its Threadneedle Street office.

The introduction of the polymer £5 notes has been regarded as a success – barring the battle with vegans (see below). The polymer £10 note (also containing traces of animal fat) is set for launch in September this year. It will feature Jane Austen on the reverse, and the Bank is using the 200th anniversary of the writer’s death on 18 July to officially unveil it.

The new tenner will be smaller than the current one – but larger than the new fiver. The size ratios will be the same as those between the old paper fiver and tenner.

Back to the 1990s



The outgoing fiver, technically known as the series E note, first appeared in June 1990, although the note that it replaced (featuring the Duke of Wellington on the reverse) didn’t stop being legal tender until the end of November 1991, writes Miles Brignall.

Back then five pounds had sufficient buying power to ­purchase three pints of beer, and two of loaves of bread on the way back from the pub. Petrol cost just 40p a litre, ­meaning it cost about £18 to fill up an average family car.

In 1991, those hoping to “work, rest and play” could have bought 19 Mars bars (at 26p each) with their £5. The latest 2017 polymer note, by comparison, will net you just eight. A pint of milk, meanwhile, was relatively expensive at 32p when compared with the 45p you will typically pay at a supermarket today.

If you were lucky enough to get £5 pocket money back then, you could buy the hot toy of 1991 – a Teenage Mutant Hero Turtle figure which cost £4.99 from Argos. If you were more of a Simpsons fan, a fiver bought you the latest branded backpack.

Those with a good memory will recall that 1991 wasn’t a happy year financially. Inflation was running at 9%, and at the start of the year interest rates were 13.375% (though by September 1991 they’d fallen to 10.375%). The chancellor, Norman Lamont, increased VAT from 15% to 17.5%. But the average house price was just £73,000.

It was arguably a tough year for music fans: by far the biggest-selling single of 1991 was (Everything I Do) I Do It for You. The Bryan Adams song from the soundtrack to the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves spent 16 weeks at number one.

The 1990-91 £5 note, which depicted George Stephenson, inventor of the Rocket steam train, had an upgrade in 1993, and in 2002 Stephenson was replaced by social reformer Elizabeth Fry. It is the notes featuring Fry that are now being phased out.

The man behind the vegan protests against traces of animal fat found in the polymer £5 note – and which will also be in the new £10 note – says he is preparing to take legal action against the Bank of England, writes Patrick Collinson.

It emerged in November that there is an “extremely small amount” of tallow, a substance made from animal fat, in the polymer pellets used in the base substrate of the polymer £5 note. Doug Maw, 48, and at the time a hotel worker in Keswick, launched a petition calling for the use of it to be stopped. It has attracted more than 136,000 signatories so far, with support from vegans, ­vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others demanding the bank halt the use of animal products in the currency.



The Bank of England says it is considering plans to replace the animal fat in the notes, but risks running straight into another row, because the most practical alternative to animal fat, it says, is palm oil – and that is likely to spark protests from environmentalists unless it can be sustainably sourced.

Maw says he will take a decision about a crowdfunded legal action next month. “We will see what the Bank decides. I have a meeting with my legal team and we will be examining if there is a case for breach of human rights if they carry on producing notes with tallow.

“Some people say this is a trivial issue, but when you are a vegan you don’t choose to accept a meal in a restaurant with just a little bit of chicken. I don’t have to eat chicken, I don’t have to buy anything with animal products. So why do I have to use notes with animal products?”

If he is dispensed a polymer £5 note from a machine, Maw says he marches into a bank to have it exchanged for £1 coins, and will do the same when the £10 note comes into circulation in September.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/28/uk-house-prices-april-brexit-inflation-wages-nationwide,"Average price of a home fell by 0.4% to £207,699 as rising inflation and low wage growth hit home, says Nationwide

UK house prices fell for a second month in a row in April in a sign that the squeeze on family incomes is starting to weigh on the property market.

The average price of a home fell by 0.4% over the month to £207,699, following a 0.3% drop in March, according to Nationwide. It was the first time that prices fell in two consecutive months in nearly five years and drove down the annual rate of house price growth to 2.6%, the weakest since June 2013.

Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the slowdown could reflect the broader backdrop for consumer finances, which are coming under increasing pressure from a combination of rising inflation and weak wage growth.



London rents fall sharply as monthly bill drops across UK Read more

“While monthly figures can be volatile, the recent softening in price growth may be a further indication that households are starting to react to the emerging squeeze on real incomes or to affordability pressures in key parts of the country,” Gardner said.

He said the outlook for the property market over the coming months was particularly difficult to predict because of the upcoming general election and uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit negotiations.

“The economic outlook is unusually uncertain, and housing market trends will depend crucially on developments in the wider economy,” he said.

Nationwide said housing affordability was a key issue for potential homebuyers, with a typical house price currently at 6.1 times average earnings, well above the long run average of 4.3 times earnings. The lender expects house price growth to more than halve in 2017 to about 2%, from 4.5% in 2016.

Consumers have been the main driver of UK economic growth since the financial crisis but there are mounting signs that the appetite for spending is beginning to wane.

Retail sales are falling, and households have been dipping into their savings to maintain spending in the face of rising prices in the shops. Inflation is currently at 2.3% and expected to rise to 3% in the coming months as the weak pound since the Brexit vote feeds through to the cost of living.

Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said that against this backdrop house prices were likely to come under increasing pressure.

“We suspect markedly weakening consumer fundamentals, likely mounting caution over making major spending decisions, and elevated house price to earnings ratios will weigh down further on housing market activity and house prices over the coming months,” he said.



However, he said that a housing crash is unlikely because the shortage of homes coming on to the market will limit the extent to which prices fall.

The weakening consumer backdrop was reflected in the latest high street lending figures from the British Bankers’ Association, which showed growth in consumer lending slowed to 6.1% in March from 6.5% in February.

The fall was due to slower growth in personal loans, credit card borrowing, and overdrafts.

“In March, annual growth in consumer borrowing from the main high street banks slowed, perhaps mirroring the dip seen in retail sales volumes as price rises appear to have started biting into consumers’ spending,” said Eric Leenders, the BBA’s managing director for retail banking.

Mortgage approvals for house purchase were 2.8% lower in March than in February, at 41,061.

Hansen Lu, property economist at Capital Economics, said the BBA data and the latest Nationwide house prices index made sense together.

“Mortgage approvals for house purchase fell in March and that subdued demand was, in turn, reflected by a modest dip in house prices in April. The main reason for this slowdown is high house prices, suggesting that prices are unlikely to accelerate again this year.”

A separate index from Nationwide building society also found that prices fell nationally in March. It said the average price of a home fell 0.3% to £207,308 following a 0.6% rise in prices in February.



Some of the frothiest parts of the central London property market have recorded the biggest price falls over the past year. Data from LSL Property Services suggested that the average price of a home in the City of London fell by 10.5% in the year to February 2017, knocking nearly £100,000 off the average price in the district at the heart of Britain’s financial services industry.



Your Move also said that the proportion of tenants in arrears increased month on month. In March 2017, the percentage of households in arrears was 9.05%, higher than the 8.1% seen a month earlier.

Despite this, the company claimed that the long-term trends “continue to be encouraging”. The proportion of tenants in arrears remains below the all-time high of 14.6% recorded in early 2010.",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/28/cybersecurity-is-your-office-coffee-machine-watching-you,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning can identify threats to an organisation – but at what cost to privacy and whistleblowers?

Troubled by something deeply unethical going on at work? Or maybe you’re plotting to leak sensitive information on the company that just sacked you? Either way, you best think twice before making your next move because an all-seeing artificial intelligence might just be analysing every email you send, every file you upload, every room you scan into – even your coffee routine.



The latest wave of cyber-defence technology employs machine learning to monitor use of the ever-expanding number of smart household objects connected to the Internet of Things – shutting down hackers before they’ve broken into corporate databases or whistleblowers before they’ve forwarded on information to the media.

One of the leading proponents is cyber-defence company Darktrace, founded in 2013 by former British intelligence officers in Cambridge and today featuring 370 employees in 23 offices globally. The company is targeting growth in the Asia-Pacific, where regional head Sanjay Aurora is promoting Darktrace’s Enterprise Immune System at the CeBIT Australia conference in Sydney on 23 May.

In an interview ahead of the conference, Aurora tells the Guardian that the Internet of Things, the interconnected everyday devices such as the smart fridge, offers more vulnerabilities to be hacked than ever before – but also more ways to scan for threats.

“In newspapers there is not a single day where we don’t read about an organisation being breached,” he says.

“At a time when even coffee machines have IP addresses, many people in security teams don’t so much as have visibility of the network.”

Where cybersecurity normally functions as a barrier to keep out previously-identified threats, Aurora says Darktrace technology behaves more like a human immune system.

“Once you understand the devices and people, once you notice subtle changes within the network, you establish a pattern of life, and whether it is lateral movement or unusual activity – maybe an employee using a device they don’t normally use, or a fingerprint scanner acting unusually – the immune system notices and takes action, detecting these things in network before they become a headline,” he says.

Darktrace’s package includes a 3D topographical real-time “threat visualizer”, which monitors everyday network activity, and the responsive Antigena system, which can decide for itself to slow systems down to give security personnel time to stop a potential breach, cut off network access to particular individuals, or mark specific emails for further investigation.

“Let’s say an employee is made redundant and becomes a potential information threat, the machine will intelligently determine what is the problem, assess the mathematical threat and then decide what action is to be taken,” Aurora says.

Darktrace claims its Enterprise Immune System has reported over 30,000 serious cyber incidents in over 2,000 deployments across the world, offering up examples such as an employee who was disgruntled about their company’s Brexit plans and was caught before they could leak the information. Another case was put forward by Darktrace co-founder Poppy Gustafsson at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in London last year. Gustafsson cited the case of attackers sending a truck into the warehouse of a luxury goods manufacturer after uploading their fingerprints to the company’s system in order to bypass the biometric scanners.

“It’s one of the few attacks where a criminal has given their fingerprint ahead of time,” she said.

Darktrace is well on the way to establishing itself in Australia ahead of the CeBIT business tech conference, already boasting clients such as national telecommunications provider Telstra.

According to a Telstra spokesperson, the company “joined forces with Darktrace in 2016, adding it to a suite of complementary security technologies which are designed and utilised to protect customer and corporate information and the Telstra network. Darktrace, along with our other technologies, people and processes, strengthens Telstra’s internal security through its ability to detect anomalous activity and its ability to visualise all network activity, resulting in a reduced time to detect potential threats.”

The move has attracted concern from Communication Workers Union (CWU) national secretary Greg Rayner, who says the union was not consulted on the introduction of the technology.

“That’s disappointing and arguably a breach of Telstra’s obligations under the current enterprise agreement,” he says.

“They’re supposed to consult on changes that will have a significant effect on the workforce. Telstra employees have been subjected to increasingly intense electronic monitoring in recent years, including scrutiny and recording of their online activities at work. We are obviously concerned that this technology will allow further intrusions into employees’ day-to-day working lives.”

Telstra has history in regard to unions and whistleblowers – in 2008 former employee Jim Ziogas was fired after being connected to a leak to the media of internal plans to de-unionise the workforce.

Whistleblowers Australia vice-president, Brian Martin, doesn’t have a lot in common with Darktrace, but he does share a fondness for immune-system analogies. “Whistleblowers are antibodies for corruption in organisations,” he tells the Guardian. “If it were possible to prevent leaks (and that remains to be shown), this might only allow problems to fester until they become much worse. Think of what happened to Volkswagen, which lacked any whistleblowers or leakers and paid a much larger penalty than if its emissions fraud had been exposed years earlier.”

He says invading the privacy of workers has the potential to create resentment and undermine loyalty, and that a lack of independent monitoring means there are serious questions regarding the effectiveness of Darktrace’s Enterprise Immune System, particularly in regard to false positives and false negatives.

“The damage to morale done by falsely accusing an employee of planning to leak documents can be imagined,” he says.

“How about this option? Adapt the software to monitor the e-communications of top managers to see whether they are planning reprisals against whistleblowers. How do you think they would like that?”

Devised as it was by former MI5 and GCHQ agents, inspired by the challenges they were facing in counterintelligence, Darktrace technology is also an interesting proposition for governments, but the company is more coy about the countries that it counts as clients than the businesses it services.

For its part, a spokesperson for the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) – the department of defence intelligence agency that bears the slogan “reveal their secrets, protect our own” – refused to confirm or deny use of Darktrace technology, telling the Guardian it does not “provide commentary on capability or use of commercial products”.

There are certainly plenty of rivals to Darktrace technology also promoting their cybersecurity platform’s integration of the latest machine learning capabilities, including CrowdStrike, Symantec and Cylance.

Then there are Darktrace’s true rivals – hackers themselves. Thomas LaRock, technical evangelist at IT company SolarWinds, warns that machine learning is a tool that can be used to attack just as easily as it can be used to defend.

If it is possible to use machine learning to build a model that helps them launch cyberattacks with greater efficiency, then that’s what you can expect to happen,” he says.

“Think of this as a spy game, where you have agents that go from one side to another. There is bound to be a person somewhere right now working on machine learning models to deter crime. One day they could be found to be working for the criminals, using machine learning models to help commit crime.”

Aurora defends the use of machine learning at Darktrace, arguing this is one game companies cannot afford to opt out of.

“If you look at the way the threat landscape is moving, it is just simply humanly impossible using conventional methods – the only way to react to these threats is AI and machine learning,” he says.

“We are proud to achieve on that front – pure, unsupervised machine learning, as employee behaviour changes. That is the secret sauce – continuously evolving and learning.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/apr/29/letter-to-my-younger-self-stop-and-be-proud-achieved-virtual-umbrella-reality,"At 22, Samantha Kingston felt lost until she discovered virtual reality. Now running her own company, she still faces prejudice because of her age

Dear Sammy,

You have just moved back home with your parents and feel like you’ve entered the twilight zone. Nothing has changed. Everyone is sitting in the same pubs and cafes, having the same conversations. At 22, you feel more lost than ever. It’s depressing.

You didn’t get the grades you wanted from university and this career thing everyone is talking about does not appeal to you. You don’t have a clue what you want to be – you’re just following the crowd. That’s why you went to university in the first place, eyes closed, picking a course at random.

You want to do more than sit behind a desk, refreshing a social media feed

You’re working at the local theatre, wondering if this is it when you get a phone call that will change your life. It’s an offer of an interview at a games company. You tell the recruiter they have called the wrong person, but they insist: “Go for the interview.” Somehow, you get the job.

You will learn about design, coding, audio and get your first taste of virtual reality. This sparks something in you. You’ll attend events and chat to developers about the struggles of getting their content to the people – this was at a time before headsets were publicly available.

You want to solve this dilemma. You want to do more than sit behind a desk, refreshing a social media feed. You don’t have much experience but you decide to go for it. Nine months after you started, you leave the games company to start your own business in the VR industry. It’s a big leap and there’s no parachute attached. You’re more scared than you’ve ever been. But it’s a sector that’s young, exhilarating and ready to grow globally. Just like you are.

Looking back, I can see how naive you were. The excitement of starting on your own will blind you to the responsibilities and frustrations that come with running a company. You spend your last £50 getting into London, only for all your meetings to be cancelled. You will be taken for a ride by larger companies when you’re starting out. You will work for free because you’re doing someone a favour. Your friends and family won’t understand what you do, and at times won’t support you. That’s going to hurt.

You will also experience prejudice because of your age. The first time you muster the courage to speak at an event, a member of the audience approaches you afterwards to say, “Nothing against you but I would never work with someone in your age category”. You’re embarrassed. Ashamed. You want to run away and hide. Those words follow you around for a long time, and to this day some people still don’t take you seriously.

Letter to my younger self: it's been ugly at times but I wouldn't change a thing Read more

You will make mistakes. You will doubt yourself. But turn that fear into confidence. Embrace being the only woman in the room at technology events – it is an opportunity. You love talking to people, so be brave. Seek out people who inspire you to do better. Ask for help. Reaching for it does not make you a failure. Take pride in hiring people who are smarter than you.

Life balance is something you are not good at. You’re 26 now and still trying to figure it out. You will go to every VR event, make sure you are seen everywhere, lend a helping hand to everyone you can. You’re exhausted but you think getting the last train home to Southampton from London every night is worth it. Even if that means surviving on two hours’ sleep.

Hang on in there. It will be at some of your most stressful points that success starts to happen for you. People recommend you because they know you will get the job done efficiently and with a smile on your face. Eventually the fear of finding work will disappear. You don’t have to say yes to everything any more. You can – and must – take time out to look after your brain and body. You are your own worst enemy sometimes.

Be present in this moment. Stop and allow yourself to feel proud of what you have achieved. Those emails can wait.

Samantha
