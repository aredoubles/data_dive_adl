Seated around a table in the dimly lit auditorium of Atlanta-based nonprofit Project South last weekend, two dozen union activists of all ages and races were trying to solve a problem – one that has vexed the southern states for a generation.

Longshoremen from South Carolina, nurses from Florida, campus workers from Tennessee, public workers employees from North Carolina, and fast-food workers had gathered to discuss one issue: how could these members of the Southern Workers Assembly help a fellow union attempt to unionize a company scattered at dozens of locations across the south? It’s a growing problem for unions, and one their opponents are determined to make sure doesn’t get any easier.

As the US economy – and particularly manufacturing – continues to expand in the south with the relocation of the auto industry, unions see big opportunities to recruit workers into the labor movement. However, they find themselves stymied by anti-union intimidation campaigns backed by big money that often include firing, intimidation and threats of plant closures if workers unionize.



With that in mind, the first question posed to the group was one that union organizers across the south find themselves asking: how would they identify workers interested in joining a union at a particular company, and make them comfortable enough to get involved in union organizing?



Many workers in the room suggest that they print union flyers and handbill the plant to gather contact information of sympathetic workers. However, some in the group worried that by targeting the company directly, they could scare potential supporters away. Then, a 20-year-old fast-food worker named Sha Drummond raised his hand.

Drummond is new to the labor movement. A little more than a year ago, he was inspired to get involved in the Fight for $15 campaign to raise hourly wages for fast-food workers after he saw some union organizers kicked out of a fast-food restaurant where he worked in Richmond, Virginia. He has already helped organize several strikes and learned a tremendous amount about organizing through taking action.

“We typically throw an event or house party and invite everyone,” said Drummond. “We just don’t invite people who work there, but we invite everyone in the community so that people know they have a lot of support. They know that people have their back.”



Donald Quick, a longtime veteran of the North Carolina Public Service Workers Union UE Local 150, quickly suggested that perhaps they could use social media to identify workers to invite to the event. While Drummond and Quick are separated by many years, they have one thing in common: they are both part of unions that lack traditional collective bargaining rights, and they are willing to think outside the box about how to organize in the south.

Inspired by the energy of the Fight for $15 movement and the growing labor movement, workers involved in the Southern Workers Assembly are attempting to build the groundwork for a network to inspire a mass movement by non-union workers across the south.



However, instead of focusing on winning one intensive campaign at a high-profile employer such as Boeing or Nissan, the assembly is instead focused on building a network of smaller minority unions that lack collective bargaining to create a groundswell of union support.



“Having a union doesn’t mean you have to have a majority of workers or a union contract,” said veteran union organizer Saladin Muhammad, co-founder of the Southern Workers Assembly. “A union exists whenever workers come together to form an organization to build power.”



At the outset of the American labor movement, before the passage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, minority unions were quite common. Small groups of workers would often band together to put pressure on the boss. They would work the company’s internal handbooks and grievance procedures, rally community and political support to put pressure on employers, engage in shop floor disobedience and, if all else failed, go out on strike to stick it to the boss.



A union exists whenever workers come together to form an organization to build power Saladin Muhammad, co-founder of the Southern Workers Assembly

Eventually, these networks of minority unions built up over decades led to the massive organizing gains they achieved in the 1930s.



“Rebuilding the labor movement in the south is going to require us to get back to the basics of what a union is,” said Muhammad. “A union is about workers building power through organization.”



However, after the mass organizing waves of the 1930s, unions largely struck to the traditional model of only representing workers in unions. This model of union organizing often relied on union representatives and labor lawyers to make sure union contracts were enforced.



Now, with the success of the strikes of Fight for $15 in building a mass movement, unions in the south are once again beginning to experiment with minority unions – where workers voluntarily join, and pay dues, to their local union rather than the union representing the entire workforce at an employer.



In 2014, after losing a high-profile union election at Volkswagen in Chattanooga, autoworkers there formed a minority union, Local 42. Following their lead, autoworkers at a Mercedes plant in Vance, Alabama, decided to form UAW Local 112, despite lacking a majority of workers in the plant who wanted to be members of the union.



Even without collective bargaining rights, both unions have won changes in company policies through protests and legal action. More importantly, the unions have shown real power by getting activists who they feel were wrongfully fired their jobs back.

Now the Southern Workers Assembly is hoping to link these new minority union efforts with other groups of non-union workers, as workers in the south face the uphill battle of rebuilding.



The United Campus Workers (UCW) in Tennessee, an affiliate of Communication Workers of America, is one of those minority unions that has built power despite lacking traditional union rights.

Originally formed in 1999 to fight for living wages for workers at the University of Tennessee, UCW has now grown into a full-fledged union despite lacking collective bargaining rights. The group has more than 2,000 members who pay monthly dues, which allows the union to have a small staff. It also enabled the UCW to hold training courses for union activists, organize rallies and lobby days, and campaign for state legislators who share their agenda of improving conditions for workers in the University of Tennessee system.



Jessica Buttermore, an administration assistant at the University of Memphis, decided to join UCW after attending the union’s annual lobby day in Nashville five years ago. She said that at first when she got active, it was sometimes difficult to get people to voluntarily agree to pay monthly dues. However, after the union won a $3 across-the-board rise in minimum wage for campus workers two years ago, she says it has become a lot easier to get workers to feel ownership of their minority union.



“If they see someone take action then talking about it, it encourages people,” says Buttermore. “For people to see that the work we are doing does have an effect, really encourages people to be involved.”



For many involved in the Southern Workers School this weekend in Atlanta, rebuilding the labor movement is less about winning union elections and more about teaching workers about the power they have to effect change.



“We gotta bring forces together who are not unionized to engage them in the labor movement,” says Muhammad. “When people think that the starting point for being in the labor movement is a union opposed to a worker organization that’s when we lose power. To organize the south, we must make people realize how much power they already have.”



Mike Elk is a member of the Washington-Baltimore NewsGuild. He is the co-founder of Payday Report and was previously senior labor reporter at Politico.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/29/whole-foods-hard-times-retail,"The upscale grocery chain is valued at almost $12bn, but six straight quarters of declining sales have led to speculation of a takeover bid. What went wrong?

Lunchtime customers at Whole Foods in Manhattan’s Union Square had little trouble expressing the shortcomings that have led the once high-flying, organic-focused retailer to become linked with a takeover.

Hummus 'crisis' sheds light on secret world of mass food production Read more

“I love the sushi, but I wouldn’t shop here except maybe for a special ingredient,” said Argentinian software designer Benjamin Vinas. “People say Whole Foods is for pretentious people, and I can see why. It’s too expensive. I don’t have the budget.”

Vinas was not the only customer to express a similar point of view. Others said that for their groceries they went several blocks north and west to lower-cost rival Trader Joe’s, where products may not be so exquisitely selected but are, in general, more uniformly discounted.

Maria Johnson, a postgraduate student, said Whole Foods’ pricing, with some items marked competitively and other expensive, was inconvenient.

“I only buy body lotion and lunch here. And maybe spices,” Johnson said. “There are so many different price points you feel like you are missing out on the more fun, expensive things – and when you are shopping for the cheaper, more affordable things, you’re reminded of the things you can’t afford.”

But the views of Manhattan’s grocery shoppers point to only part of the problem for Whole Foods, sometimes called Whole Paycheck, which has been facing a backlash from consumers.

Founded in Austin, Texas, in 1980, Whole Foods Market, to give it its official name, has about 462 locations and a market value of almost $12bn. The chain helped make health food and organic food mainstream, and in its boom years shook up the food retail industry. Whole Foods had grand plans for a UK expansion too, opening its first outpost in Kensington in 2004 with plans for 40 more. But Whole Foods has stalled: like much of the retail sector, it faces economic headwinds including razor-thin margins, competition from other retailers offering organic food, and increasingly price-conscious consumers.

In February, the company announced it would close nine stores: in Chicago, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, and Georgia, and two each in Colorado and California. The closures, which followed six straight quarters of sales declines, represented the first downsizing since 2008. Founder and chief executive John Mackey explained that the business had changed because “the more conventional, mainstream supermarkets have upped their game. The world is very different today than it was five years ago.”

One rival chain, Sprouts Farmers Market, was found to be on average 19% cheaper than Whole Foods. Other rivals, including Kroger, picked up Whole Foods customers. Last month, Barclays advised that Whole Foods had experienced a “staggering” decline in foot traffic that it estimated at 3%, or roughly 14 million customers.

Whole Foods has long been the butt of jokes for its prices – although it disputes it is more expensive than it rivals – and its bougie products. Comedian John Oliver is particularly fond of its asparagus water.

The difficult transition from expensive behemoth to a more nimble grocery store is reflected in its share price, which has dropped by almost half since October 2013. Investors are increasingly petitioning the company to move faster with reforms.

An acquisition would underscore the consolidation of the US food retail industry as the sector prepares to compete against online retailers including Amazon, stores like Walmart and discount chains such as Aldi.

Earlier this week, the Financial Times reported that Cerberus Capital Management, the New York private equity firm that owns Albertsons and Safeway, had initiated talks with bankers about making a bid.

Other potential suitors include Jana Partners, an activist investor group that has amassed a 9% stake. In a regulatory filing, Jana said it wanted Whole Foods to “improve its technology and operations to better compete with larger rivals, shake up its board, and explore how much potential bidders might be willing to pay”.

As more buy clothes online, Walmart eyes a piece of the action Read more

Jana has proposed nominees to the Whole Foods board, including Glenn Murphy, a former Gap chief executive, and former New York Times food journalist Mark Bittman, who has argued that the chain needs simplifying.

Jana is run by 58-year-old yoga and health food devotee Barry Rosenstein. He has said he wants Whole Foods to learn from national chains while staying true to its mission.

Whole Foods’ own efforts at reform include the expansion of 365 smaller stores offering lower-priced products. The stores will stock about 7,000 items, far fewer than the 35,000 to 52,000 at a typical Whole Foods location.

Outside Trader Joe’s, Brooklyn homemaker Eva Lev said she rarely visits Whole Foods nowadays. “It’s like that Jim Gaffigan joke – Whole Foods on Sunday is just a refugee camp for people with too much money.” Lev added she prefers Trader Joe’s “because it seems like an everyman’s place, and you can still get organic”.",guardian.com,False

A hacker who claimed to have stolen the forthcoming season of Netflix’s hit series Orange is the New Black and demanded a ransom payment claimed on Saturday to have followed through on its threat to release several episodes online.

The hacker, operating under the name The Dark Overlord, initially demanded that Netflix pay an unspecified ransom to prevent all the new episodes from being prematurely released online.



The hacker had already purportedly uploaded the first episode to an illegal file-sharing service. The authenticity of that uploaded file could not be legally confirmed.

Early on Saturday, the hacker announced the move to release the episodes on Twitter. The post included a link to an illegal file-sharing service where purportedly 10 episodes from the series’ fifth season were available for download. The authenticity of those files could not be legally confirmed.

New episodes of the series are scheduled for official release on 9 June. Netflix did not immediately return a call seeking comment on the apparent release of 10 episodes.

Earlier, it said that a small production vendor that works with several major TV studios had suffered a breach. The company, based in Los Gatos, California, described the breach as an “active situation” that was being investigated by the FBI and other authorities.

In the ransom note, The Dark Overlord claimed to have stolen series from other studios by breaking into a single company. The purported hacker promised to also release those titles unless “modest” ransoms were paid.

Rumours of a massive leak of Hollywood films and TV episodes have been circulating online for months, fed by purported screenshots of footage and a copy of a proposed deal to delete the stolen material in return for tens of thousands of dollars in electronic currency.

When the Associated Press contacted The Dark Overlord in February, the hacker said the stolen video would not be made publicly available after all, making the far-fetched claim that “no one really [cares] about unreleased movies and TV show episodes.”

It is not clear what triggered The Dark Overlord’s renewed ransom demands or apparent decision to release the episodes of Orange is the New Black.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/29/fangs-breakneck-rise-facebook-amazon-netflix-google,"The tech giants have ballooned in value by $250bn since January - double the value of all the gold mined in a year - in four months

From Standard Oil at the turn of the 20th century to IBM and General Motors in the 1970s and General Electric in the 1990s, the US has always produced behemoth corporations that bestride the world. But this is the era of the Fangs, the “big four” of technology, and they are currently growing at breakneck speed.

Facebook, Amazon, Neflix and Google have been roaring away since the turn of this year. Their share prices have climbed so far, so fast, that together they are now worth an extraordinary $250bn more than just four months ago.

To put that sum into perspective, compare it to the value of all the gold mined in the world in a year , which is worth about $115bn. Or look at it another way - $250bn is about the same as the annual GDP of countries such as Venezuela, Pakistan and Ireland.

Together the four firms are now valued on Wall Street at more than $1.5tn, about the same as the Russian economy.

The Fang acronym is not new - it was first coined four years ago by US finance expert and broadcaster Jim Cramer – but the rocket behind their share prices is now making it mainstream.

In fact, it is now slightly out of date, because Google rebranded itself as Alphabet last year, so it should technically be “Fana”. There is, however, one thing no one can argue with. Their share prices, boosted further by positive financial results this week, have delivered huge multibillion-dollar boosts to the personal fortunes of their founders, all of whom still run the companies they dreamed up.

Amazon, which beat forecasts with first-quarter sales of $36bn, has increased in value by $80bn since the start of 2017 to $440bn, meaning the near-17% stake held by Jeff Bezos is now worth $13.5bn more than it was in January. His total wealth now stands at $74bn.



Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, is now on the brink of toppling the legendary investor Warren Buffett to become the world’s second-richest person after Bill Gates. Both men are spending their money fast, Gates on fighting malaria and other treatable diseases in the developing world, and Bezos on building his own spaceflight company, Blue Origin, with the aim of beating the Tesla boss Elon Musk to Mars.

Facebook, which reports ist results next week, has grown in value by $92bn to $424bn this year. Its founder Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune has increased alongside the share price by $13bn to around $60bn. He owns only about 14% of the quoted shares, but under an unusual voting structure he controls more than 50% of the company.

Alphabet is the gorilla in this room of big beasts. It is now valued at $610bn, up $68bn since the end of December. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, each own around 7% each. Their combined stake is worth about $85bn, up $8.5bn since the start of year.

The relative minnow is Netflix, which has climbed in value by $12.5bn since January to $66bn, or three times the value of Sky TV. Reed Hastings, its co-founder and current chief executive, has seen his 1.43% shareholding rise in value by $180m to $944m.

Thomas Husson at the tech research group Forrestersays Netflix has far to go. “Not only have they reached 100m subscribers, they have managed to create a digital relationship with their customers. They know their preferences and are good at acting on the insights they collect on their customers. They are growing fast and are very disruptive.”

What lies behind the astronomical increase in value of the Fangs? To a certain extent, they’ve been buoyed by the same tide that raised US shares to record highs this year, the election of Donald Trump. The new president may threaten trade wars and real wars, and prompt unheard-of levels of domestic unrest, but to Wall Street investors, all that pales in comparison to a couple of policy proposals that have been on the cards since the day he won the Republican nomination - lower corporation taxes and a tax holiday on repatriated cash.



The US has one of the highest levels of corporation tax in the world, up to 35% with some states charging more on top. For internationally competitive companies, that creates a strong motivation to not bring income earned overseas back to the US. The Fangs have huge international earnings.

One proposed solution, favoured by the Republican party for decades and periodically enacted, is a repatriation tax holiday - a fixed period during which money brought onshore is taxed less. The last holiday in 2004 led to $362bn being brought back to the US at a reduced tax rate of 5.25%. Paradoxically, each tax holiday increases the need for the next, because companies start holding ever greater amounts of their tax offshore in the expectation that the next Republican government will announce a new one.

In the expectation of just that, which would allow a flood of onshored income to boost dividend payouts and share buybacks, investors have been buying up stocks in companies with foreign holdings.

But the Fangs also have their own unique benefits. In a tech industry with a globalised supply chain fighting anti-globalisation movements, where businesses are finding it tough to provide big improvements on devices from laptops to smartphones, and where the next big thing keeps failing to take off they sell nothing but binary code sent over the net.

All four are subtly different, but firmly overlapping industries. Facebook and Google are primarily advertising companies. One sells things to you while you’re looking for information, the other while you’re chatting to friends. They’re also both in the business of user-generated content, encouraging their customers to upload fun, shareable videos to YouTube and Facebook so they have something to put advertising against – and keep you coming back for more.

In the content industry, the two also compete against Netflix and Amazon, which both produce web video far more directly, with millions invested in the creation of high-quality long-form drama and comedy. Amazon competes against Google in the shopping business, because more and more of us skip the middleman when we want to buy something.

And then there are the enormously profitable back-ends. Amazon Web Services makes more profit selling cloud computing services to other companies than it does selling things to you or I, and Google Cloud makes almost as much money doing the same thing to its own startups.

None of Fangs have reached the astronomical levels of profitability seen at Apple, which has mastered the art of building expensive technology and selling it for eye-watering levels of profit. Apple, however, also has a weakness. When it comes to its revenue, it has only one really huge product: the iPhone.

The Fangs, by contrast, are diversified. They can sell their stuff wherever there is internet access, they don’t have to worry about pesky supply chain issues and they’re aiming for the top of the pile.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/24/new-status-symbol-hard-work-spending-ceos,"The rich used to show how much they could spend on things they didn’t need. Today, a public display of productivity is the new symbol of class power

Almost 120 years ago, during the first Gilded Age, sociologist Thorstein Veblen coined the term “conspicuous consumption”. He used it to refer to rich people flaunting their wealth through wasteful spending. Why buy a thousand-dollar suit when a hundred-dollar one serves the same function? The answer, Veblen said, was power. The rich asserted their dominance by showing how much money they could burn on things they didn’t need.

While radical at the time, Veblen’s observation seems obvious now. In the intervening decades, conspicuous consumption has become deeply embedded in the texture of American capitalism. Our new Gilded Age is even more Veblenian than the last. Today’s captains of industry publicize their social position with private islands and superyachts while the president of the United States covers nearly everything he owns in gold.

Robots won't just take our jobs – they'll make the rich even richer Read more

But the acquisition of insanely expensive commodities isn’t the only way that modern elites project power. More recently, another form of status display has emerged. In the new Gilded Age, identifying oneself as a member of the ruling class doesn’t just require conspicuous consumption. It requires conspicuous production.

If conspicuous consumption involves the worship of luxury, conspicuous production involves the worship of labor. It isn’t about how much you spend. It’s about how hard you work.

Nowhere is the cult of conspicuous production more visible than among America’s CEOs. Today’s top executives are devoted work-worshippers, nearly to the point of perversity. Apple CEO Tim Cook told Time that he begins his day at 3.45am. General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt told Fortune that he has worked 100-hour workweeks for 24 years. Not to be outdone, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer told Bloomberg News that she used to work 130-hour workweeks. And so on.

It goes without saying that these individuals aren’t working out of necessity. The vast majority of Americans work because their survival depends on a wage. By contrast, Mayer, Immelt and Cook could retire tomorrow and still live very comfortably for the rest of their lives, with plenty left over to pass on to the next generation – their collective net worth is almost $1.5bn.

But conspicuous production isn’t about meeting one’s material needs. It’s about the public display of productivity as a symbol of class power. In an era of extreme inequality, elites need to demonstrate to themselves and others that they deserve to own orders of magnitude more wealth than everyone else. Cook is approximately 500,000% richer than the average American – but he wakes up at 3.45 in the morning. This is the hallmark of conspicuous production: it justifies the existence of an imperial class by showcasing their superhuman levels of industry.

One way is to turn your leisure into labor by 'working on yourself​'

The irony is that grueling workweeks aren’t exclusively an elite phenomenon. Far from it. Many less fortunate Americans perform similar feats of productivity, although they have fewer incentives and opportunities to advertise it. A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute found that Americans workers work significantly more hours than they did a few decades ago – especially women, black people and the poor. A black woman in the bottom fifth of earners worked 349 more hours in 2015 than she would have in 1979. The reason is simple: wages have barely budged since the 1970s, which means today’s workers have to work harder to make ends meet.

Compare the woman working long hours for minimum wage with the woman working the same hours for $30m a year. One is trying to avoid hunger and homelessness; the other is broadcasting her power and prestige. The labor of the latter isn’t necessary in the normal sense – but neither is a ten-thousand-dollar handbag. If conspicuous consumption celebrates gratuitous spending, conspicuous production celebrates gratuitous working. Both convey dominance by making a spectacle of excess.

In the first Gilded Age, excess looked like a woman in pearls alongside a woman in rags. In the second Gilded Age, it looks like a woman who works hundred-hour workweeks but doesn’t need the money, alongside a woman who works just as hard but can barely keep a roof over her head.

Yet conspicuous production takes many forms. Even people who can’t afford to retire tomorrow can still engage in some version of it and enjoy a portion of the elite status that it confers. Veblen’s most provocative argument was that the wastefulness of the rich inspired admiration, not anger. Other classes tried to emulate it as best they could: middle-class people couldn’t live like a railroad baron, but they could indulge in little luxuries to bid up their social standing. The same rule applies to conspicuous production. Most Americans will never attain the decadent heights of CEO-style hyperwork, but they can still make a fetish of productivity.

One way is to turn your leisure into labor by “working on yourself”. The most obvious example is exercise, which has acquired a compulsive character among members of the urban professional class. The neighborhoods where they’re likely to live are littered with boutique fitness studios such as SoulCycle and luxury gyms such as Equinox. These are places where the labor of self-improvement and self-purification continue long after the labor required to pay one’s bills ends. And they exist alongside a complementary ecosystem of juice bars and organic food stores, where one obtains the proper fuel to power the production of the self.

The stated reason for all this is “health”. But the amount of time that many better-off Americans spend exercising far exceeds what is required to be healthy. That’s because the intricate demands of today’s fitness and nutritional regimens aren’t ultimately about wellbeing. They’re designed to express class power. In the second Gilded Age, you can typically estimate a person’s tax bracket by their physique – class is literally inscribed on the body. Richer bodies aren’t just thinner but precisely muscled in all sorts of ways. They reflect an enormous and, strictly speaking, unnecessary expenditure of effort. They embody work in excess of need, signaling wealth through wastefulness and justifying one’s possession of it through the performance of personal virtue.

The future: where borrowing is the norm and ownership is luxury Read more

But you don’t have to be a CEO or an affluent professional to partake in conspicuous production. Technology has made it possible for everyone to see everything as an opportunity for productivity. You can measure your sleep, sex and steps with a Fitbit, your attractiveness with Tinder, your wittiness with Twitter, your popularity with Facebook. You can transform your personality into a dashboard of data streams that can be monitored, analyzed and optimized with the precision of an industrial process. You can turn your life into a factory – and not just metaphorically. In producing yourself, you produce economic value for others. The hours you spend on these platforms may be unwaged, but they generate real revenue for the companies that own them.

This is the genius of conspicuous production. It not only promotes a culture of overwork, it makes our dwindling amount of leisure time economically productive. There is no escape: either we’re working for the company or we’re working on ourselves, but we’re always working. “Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours of what we will” was the anthem of the workers who first demanded the eight-hour-day more than a century ago. Those distinctions don’t make sense any more. Even our sleep is factored into our productivity score – the entrepreneur of the self never gets to clock out.



Today, the old slogan of the labor movement sounds like utopian science fiction. Imagine a society that claimed so little of our labor. Imagine a world where the poor didn’t have to work so hard to exist, and the rich didn’t have to work so hard to appear worthy of their wealth, because rich and poor didn’t exist.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/22/walmart-bonobos-deal-amazon-online-retail,"A likely deal between Walmart and Bonobos, a hybrid digital/brick-and-mortar menswear brand, may be a sign of the future of retail

“Founded on Fit, Focused on Style, Built on Service” – that’s the retail promise offered by Bonobos, the men’s e-tailing business that’s being courted by Walmart and idolized by the garment industry as a model for reviving US retail woes.

The $300m acquisition of the chain, which has more than two dozen stores or “guideshops” in key cities like Chicago, New York and Atlanta, is likely to be announced imminently, according to industry sources.

If the deal is confirmed it will not only place Bonobos 38-year-old co-founder and CEO Andy Dunn at the forefront of Walmart’s online clothing battle with Amazon, but will endorse a hybrid online/bricks-and-mortar vision some hope can be retail’s future.

Retail revolution: should cities ban chain stores? Read more

US high streets are witnessing a Darwinian winnowing. In recent months hundreds of closures have been announced as retailers including Macy’s, Sears, American Apparel and Abercrombie & Fitch have scaled back their bricks-and-mortar operations in the face of a shift to online shopping.

Bonobos offers an alternative. It operates a small number of stores that act as fitting rooms but do not to fulfill orders on site, only from distribution centers. Their locations carry no inventory – customers try on its slim-fitting, fashion-conscious clothes – ranging from T-shirts and jeans to business suits and black-tie – for fit and style, and then have their acquisitions shipped to their home from a central warehouse. The stores are as much advertisement as sales floor. Most of Bonobos’s sales are done online by people who may never have visited one of their stores.

It’s an e-tailing hybrid that’s become popular with men, who, broadly observed, do not enjoy shopping or require the same level of consideration as their counterparts.

“I always hated shopping. It wasn’t fun, even for me. But here I just want to buy out the store,” said 28-year-old medical student Philip Maynard, outside a Bonobos guide-shop on 5th Avenue in Lower Manhattan. Maynard said it didn’t matter to him that he couldn’t walk out with his purchases.

“They have a good business online, and the stuff comes when they say it’s going to come, and I’ve never had a problem returning anything.”

Bonobos, which was founded in 2007, established its reputation as a retailer with jeans and chinos. After several rounds of investment, sales are reported to be around $100m, up from $40m in 2012.

The model addresses the online retailers problem of consumers not being able to try on clothes before they buy them, and the traditional retailer’s issue of delivering good service.

As Dunn told Business of Fashion in 2013, he’d worked at Abercrombie & Fitch folding sweaters. “You’re basically the inventory manager of the store, being marginally helpful to the customers. It’s more of a job about keeping clothes folded than it is about delivering service.”

Bonobos’s true innovation may be challenging the belief that the instant gratification of walking out with a purchase is key to the retail experience. “It’s not,” Dunn said. “It’s has been astonishing how little our customer cares.”

The concept started as a Stanford MBA project involving Dunn and co-founder Brian Spaly with the goal to provide men with better-fitting clothes, and specifically to design and produce chinos that eliminate “Khaki Diaper Butt”.

Dunn recognized it could be the internet company he was looking for.

As he told Coverteur: “Sometimes the future is rooted in the past, which is sort of counterintuitive. If you think about old school menswear, it was about the tailor around the corner and that one-to-one relationship you had with that person. We are bringing that back.”

They started with a showroom in New York, followed by a 500 sq ft store in Boston. Dunn realized they’d hit on something. “All of a sudden, it was like, this is it, it’s going to be these small, service-driven experiential stores where you have one-on-one service and where you keep out the complexity of a lot of inventory, but you can access this incredibly wide assortment.”



Seattle is the testing ground as Amazon eyes its next big idea Read more

In lower Manhattan, a store associate explained that by not worrying about back-of-house stuff like inventory they can focus on customer service.

“If you’re fitted for one suit, then your measurements are good for all our different suits. That makes it easier – they get sized once and don’t have to come back in unless they want to. Customers may stop by every few weeks and get a couple of things, or the men who come in once a season and we just wardrobe them.”

But, she cautioned, the system might not necessarily work for women, whose requirements around style and color and sizing are more intricate and nuanced. Nor will the Bonobos model solve the larger problems of the retail sector, which accounts for about one in 10 American jobs, or the blight affecting the US main street or its declining system of shopping malls.

Since October, more than 89,000 retail positions have been lost. According to some estimates, the sector is on track to lose more stores this year than during the great recession of 2008, its problems accelerating even as a consumer confidence is high and unemployment low, suggesting the changes are systemic and not cyclical.

But the Bonobos deal illustrates the accelerating arms race between Amazon, valued at $423bn, and Walmart, valued at $222bn. Wall Street might love Amazon more but the Arkansas-based retailer far exceeds Amazon in earnings – $13.6bn last year to Amazon’s $2.4bn – and it is aggressively expanding its online businesses.

Last September, Walmart completed a $3.3bn acquisition of the discount and deals-driven shopping site Jet.com. It has gone on to pay $70m for footwear online retailer ShoeBuy and $51m for outdoor e-tailer Moosejaw, and agreed the acquisition of Modcloth, a vintage-inspired womenswear producer.

Jet.com founder Marc Lore, now president and chief executive officer of Walmart’s e-commerce arm, rationalized that smaller brands would gain visibility on the larger platforms. “So suddenly what was a certain size business now, overnight, becomes that much bigger,” he told WWD. Amazon, meanwhile, has been pumping up its high-end online offerings, making deals with brands including Levi Strauss & Co.

Meanwhile, “real” shops are suffering. Outside Bonobos of 5th Avenue, Philip Maynard explained that he used to shop at J Crew and Brooks Brothers but had since switched. “I love the stuff and its perfect for me,” showing off a pair chinos. “It’s fashionable and work-appropriate. It’s half tech and half friendly and approachable.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/21/tech-industry-coding-kentucky-hillbillies,"As Highway 119 cleaves through the mountains of eastern Kentucky, exposed bands of black gold stretch on for miles – come get us if you can, they tease. And for years, miners did: they had good employment that earned them upwards of $70,000 a year and built a legacy of blue-collar pride in the region. “We felt like what we did was important,” says Rusty Justice, a self-described entrepreneur who hauled his first truck of coal in eighth grade. And it was. In 2004, coal powered half of America’s electrical needs.

The burrowers: copper mine's fate hints at light at the end of tunnel for Michigan Read more

But by 2011, Justice and his business partner, Lynn Parish, who worked in coal for 40 years, began to worry. Natural gas was enjoying an uptick that would later turn into a surge thanks to new fracking technologies, and the men could see “Obama wasn’t going to be kind” to them. So the two coal men from Pikeville began thinking about how they could diversify.

Don’t get them wrong: coal in Kentucky is still very much king. But it is king the same way Queen Elizabeth is the monarch of the UK: a house of power to be revered, but no longer counted on for daily providence. For that, coal country must transform itself into something else, a new place on the map the hopeful call “Silicon Holler”.

In its own, proud way, Pikeville has a new message for America: we’re ready to move on if you’re ready to let us do it our way. That means some help from the government, but not a handout. “We need to identify the doers and facilitate their ideas,” Justice says.

Over a plate of barbecue and sweet potatoes, Justice recounts a doer’s quest to find a business idea outside of coal. “We considered just about everything. Windfarms, solar farms, hog farms – you name it,” he laughs. As unemployment tore through their 7,000-person town, Justice and Parish prayed for a business idea that would not just pay, but pay people what they had been making before in the mines.

“We thought about our greatest strengths and we said, ‘Our mountains, our people’. Then we thought about our greatest weaknesses and we said the same thing.” The mountains were beautiful, but they were expensive to transport anything across. The people were hard-working but lacked education. Their breakthrough came when Justice and Parish visited a workforce retraining expo in 2014 in Lexington, where they learned about coding.

The concept appealed to them. Each year, 600,000 US tech jobs go unfilled, jobs that ultimately go overseas but could be on-shored if more Americans had the right skills. Even better, the job paid the same as the mines.

Justice had seen first-hand how miners employed logic to solve life or death problems underground. Still, he wondered, could a coalminer really code? He called his computer-savvy friend Justin Hall with that question. “I don’t see why not,” Hall said. “Great, you’re hired,” Justice told him.

They placed ads for their new web and app design company, Bitsource, in 2015, then watched as more than 900 applications rolled in. From this pool, they chose 11 former miners who scored highest on a coding aptitude test. Two years later, in an old Coca-Cola factory by the Big Sandy river, nine men and one woman remain.

On a late March day, Hall stands at a whiteboard in front of three coders, diagramming a web app they’ve been commissioned to build that will track the outcomes of a health program that gives participants food vouchers to take to the farmers’ market. He fills the board with modules and nodes as the guys shout out ideas in lingo that eventually makes Garland Couch, a 55-year-old coder, pause at how far they’ve come. “Man, we’re nerds now,” he laughs, pushing his Under Armour cap back on his head. After the session, they break for lunch, then return to work with Drupal software on laptops whose Apple icons glow next to bumper stickers that say “Friend of Coal”.

Despite the team’s new profession, the stickers are a nod of respect to an industry they all got their start in, an industry that still employs some of their friends and family. As Parish is fond of saying, change is necessary, “but you don’t want to upset the one who brought you to the dance”.

Bitsource is not the only tech company changing Kentucky. After realizing how difficult it was to get coders to move to Louisville, Ankur Gopal, CEO of Interapt, began TechHire East Kentucky (TEKY) to train local talent in a program modeled off the success of Bitsource. In mid-March, Congressman Ro Khanna of California traveled to Paintsville, Kentucky, to meet TEKY’s first graduating class of 30, and to learn how Silicon Holler can meet the needs of Silicon Valley. The congressman said later by phone that he returned to his district shocked by the appetite for diversification he had encountered in former coal country. “More people need to go down there and see what I saw,” he said.

Despite the congressman’s enthusiasm, Silicon Holler faces two significant barriers to making its on-shoring vision a reality. The first is broadband. Most Americans living in cities are used to instantaneous internet, but broadband is rare in Kentucky and that means that most modern companies won’t even consider locating in their towns.

No one knows that better than Donovan Blackburn, the city manager of Pikeville, who is partly responsible for curbing Pikeville’s unemployment rate, which still has not dipped below 10%. He is another one of the charismatic tech visionaries in eastern Kentucky who thinks Silicon Holler is part of the answer. But he’s also a realist. If Pikeville doesn’t get broadband – and fast – it will be shut off from the modern economy, no matter how many capable coders live in the area.

The predicament is maddening to Blackburn. Pikeville can’t get new jobs without broadband. But it can’t get broadband without the $15m it would cost to connect Pikeville to the backbone of fiber optic cables the state is building across Kentucky in a broadband initiative of its own called KYWired. Blackburn is hopeful that the federal government will step in with a subsidy, although he admits the Trump administration has not looked eager to spend more money in Appalachia.

The 2018 budget the White House submitted to Congress eliminated both the Appalachia Regional Commission and the US Economic Development Commission, two organizations specifically appointed with $340m to help places like eastern Kentucky recover from coal’s collapse. But Blackburn remains confident that the administration will play ball, driven by his conviction that they have a moral responsibility to do so. “The federal government broke it, so the federal government needs to fix it,” he says, referring to the Obama-era regulations most in Pikeville selectively blame for coal’s collapse. “That money is going to come out of their pocket one way or another,” he says, either in the form of welfare payments, or through investments in infrastructure. “We don’t want a fish,” Blackburn says, echoing Justice. “We want to learn how to.”

On another day, Hall and his young creative director, Payton May, are having lunch at Mona’s, a family restaurant. May mentions the calls they have gotten from several companies asking “how they can do a Bitsource, too”. One of them was Google. The other was a mining company in Australia. Hall says they were uncomfortable that anyone thought what they were doing was so unique, and they were unsure of what to say. “Well,” May says looking over at Hall across his glass of Pepsi, “you might want to tell them to collapse their economy first”.

It was a reference to what every coder at Bitsource named as the principal reason they were able to do what they did: starvation is the mother of motivation.

If Bitsource didn’t work out, their next option was leaving Pikeville for some place like Louisville or Lexington. No one wanted to pull children out of school, or sell homes. So for the first 22 weeks, Couch, the 55-year-old coder, says, he didn’t look up from his tutorials to learn his neighbor’s last name. Although Couch says there were many times he felt like giving up, particularly when they got to JavaScript, what saved him was a perfectionist’s mentality he’d developed working over 30 years in the mines. Couch’s colleague, William Stephens, agrees. “In the mines, if you messed up, you could either kill someone or cost your company millions of dollars,” he explains, cracking peanuts on a Friday afternoon after work. “Failure for us was just not an option.”

It’s a work ethic Hall believes could benefit companies – if they can get over their culture shock.

Two years in, Hall says, teaching the miners to code hasn’t been the hardest part. It’s finding enough clients to hire them – despite staffers having completed more than 60 projects and getting Drupal-certified, Hall says, companies are still cautious to take a chance on them. Part of that is because they are new, but part of it, he believes, is because some companies still hold regional biases. “I’ve gone to friends in Louisville and they’ll say, ‘You guys in Pikeville? You’re kind of a bunch of hillbillies, aren’t you?’” Blackburn says he has encountered similar dynamics. “People will say, ‘Oh, you’re going to Pikeville? Better make sure you’re packin’! There’s this idea still out there we’re all still barefoot and pregnant.”

For all the negative stereotypes associated with it, Pikeville has no interest in divorcing itself from its hillbilly roots. For one thing, it’s the only identity residents have ever known, and nothing else has ever fit. “Every other part of the country I’ve ever gone to, I’ve always felt uncomfortable,” Justice says. The guys at Bitsource also view being a hillbilly is something positive. “A hillbilly is someone who is hard-working, thoughtful, and loyal,” Couch says. “And rugged,” he adds. “Because we’ve seen some tough times.”

As eastern Kentucky scrambles to connect with the modern economy, it is certain they will see some more. But Pikeville is no stranger to transformation, and working with Washington is part of its civic DNA.

In 1960, Pikeville’s mayor, William Hambly, went to the capital with a big ask for the town. He wanted funds to reroute the railroad and the river through the Peach Orchard Mountain. The first polluted Pikeville and made his patients sick; the other flooded often and created successive disasters. Washington agreed, and, in a feat of dirt-piling rivaled in the western hemisphere only by the Panama Canal, the so-called “Cut Through Project” created 400 new acres of flat land to build on, changing the trajectory of development in Pikeville forever. It would change the culture, too.

“In Pikeville we already moved the mountain,” Justice says. “Nothing really much scares us.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/22/what-if-were-living-in-a-computer-simulation-the-matrix-elon-musk,"Virtual reality technology is making great advances, but it has also helped popularise a theory long debated by philosophers and now gaining supporters in Silicon Valley – that the outside world is itself a simulation

Have you ever wondered if life is not exactly what it’s cracked up to be? OK, let’s take that thought a little further. Have you ever suffered from an identity crisis? Yes? One in which you suspected that you’re not a real person, but instead an extremely sophisticated computer simulation of a real person produced by an immensely more developed civilisation than that which we take to be our own?

It’s just possible that I lost you on that last point, but stay with me, because the reality we take for granted is coming under increasing technological and theoretical threat.

Earlier this month in an office block in Euston, I put on a virtual reality (VR) headset and began playing a prototype of a game developed by a company called Dream Reality Interactive. The company was set up by David Ranyard, the former head of Sony’s VR division.

Ranyard has a PhD in artificial intelligence which he says has been “useless for 19 years”. But he believes there’s going to be a convergence in VR and artificial intelligence (AI) soon, and his company aims to be there when that happens.

There’s a religious element to the notion of a giant simulation, a sense that there is a higher, purer reality

What’s changing is accessibility. Ten years ago VR was the preserve of wealthy “early adopters”. Now you can pick up a reasonable VR set for £600. Ranyard thinks the price will continue to fall, as will the size of the headset, until it becomes more like wearing a pair of glasses.

But right now I’m wearing a large case over my eyes, and headphones. I feel instantly removed from my environment. In front of me I can see a ball, which I can move by looking at a cursor. The ball travels along a high narrow pathway in a vertiginous 3D computer simulation, and I must guide it into various targets to get to the next stages, where a series of ever more fantastic backdrops unfold.

In terms of skill, it is quite simple, but the striking aspect of the game is the physical sensation of playing it. I feel and therefore believe that I am physically moving back and forth, as though I am on a chair on wheels. External reality has fallen away and I am in a strange and compelling world, anxious not to fall off the terrifying precipices. My brain sends signals to my body that create the illusion that it’s shooting around like a pinball, when in fact I am stationary.

So from one perspective it’s just another video game with added thrills. But there’s also something else going on here, a radical change of narrative perspective. Computer games are a form of story, and human beings are devoted storytellers.

As Yuval Noah Harari argues in his book Sapiens, the ability to create binding fictions is what enabled us to become the most dominant species on the planet. And what are stories if not representations, or simulations, of reality?

“I do talks and I have this image of Harold Lloyd [the silent movie star] who’s about to fall off this clock,” says Ranyard. “And the point I make is that in order to care about it, you have to care about him. So part of the film is setting you up to like him. In VR you don’t need to do that set-up because it’s you. There are a whole range of emotions we haven’t used because we’ve always had to do it through empathy.”

VR is different because it’s not like a film, in which you watch other people in an invented reality. You are instead the star of what feels like an alternative reality.

Leaving aside the moral implications of this change – and whether it heralds greater self-absorption and social detachment – what is notable, for me, is the aftereffect. It is something of a relief, but also disorienting, to remove the headset and return to the real world. I experience a kind of ontological dissonance, as it takes a few minutes before the familiar returns to its reliable concrete self.

And in that discomfort, that bodily sense of uncertainty, there lies a far more profound and unsettling question. What if the reality I’ve returned to isn’t real but just another, more finely realised simulation? What if the thing our senses – so easily fooled by the headset – tell us is real life are in fact an elaborate creation, every bit as illusory as that I’d experienced on the precarious pathway built out of pixels?

It’s a hoary metaphysical debate that has concerned thinkers as diverse as Descartes, Zhuang Zhou and even, arguably, the godfather of philosophy, Plato. It has also been the subject of countless science-fiction stories, including, most influentially, The Matrix film series. But how can we be sure that reality is real?

In The Matrix, made in 1999 by the Wachowski sisters, humans have been enslaved, paralysed and used as an energy source by advanced machines. But instead of realising their plight, humans are locked in a false reality, a giant simulation created by their machine masters to subdue them.

In essence The Matrix was a reworking of the philosopher Hilary Putnam’s “brain in a vat” scenario, in which a disembodied brain is subject to computer stimulation and operates in a false reality. And in turn Putnam’s vision was an update of the 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes’s first meditation, in which he posited the idea that an evil demon had fabricated the external world.

Constructed reality: are we living in a computer simulation? – tech podcast Read more

For all its philosophical heritage, The Matrix was most of all perfect cinematic fodder for alienated teenagers. But four years after it was released, the Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom wrote a paper provocatively titled Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?. The paper argued that one of three propositions is true:

a) The human race is likely to become extinct before reaching a “post-human” stage.

b) Any post-human civilisation is unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of its evolutionary history (or variations thereof).

c) We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.

Known as the simulation argument, it is a wonderful piece of logical projection. There have, naturally, been several critiques of Bostrom’s hypothesis, some on complex logical grounds, and some arguing that creating convincing ancestor simulations will remain impossible.

The hypothesis has attracted the interest and attention of many futurologists and Silicon Valley types. The New Yorker reported last year that two unnamed tech billionaires have gone so far as to employ scientists to work out how to break us out of the simulation.

The appeal of the hypothesis, and its shocking third option (which I explain in more detail below), is partly that it’s a challenge to the basic foundations of our perceptions, but also, paradoxically, that it plugs into some longstanding human preoccupations. Perhaps the oldest human story is that the world and all we see and know is the product of a creator. So there’s a kind of religious element to the notion of a giant simulation, a sense that there is a higher, purer reality, if we could only but grasp it.

(Nicolas Hénin, one of the western hostages held by Islamic State in Syria, reported on his release that one of the jihadis was obsessed with The Matrix, and believed that he had escaped the matrix by going to Syria.)

Back in the real world, or rather back in the possible simulation I take to be the real world, technology advances apace. We are seeing rapid progress in computer science, including the development of quantum computers, whose vastly increased potential capacity would be vital for a large-scale simulation.

At the same time there is continued progress in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, biotechnology and other areas that would help create more convincing simulations. And we can see that with each new breakthrough in technology, we tend to make better, more convincing representations of the world, both now and in the past.

If we assume that these developments continue, and with them our interest in creating simulations of the world, then at some point in the future – 1,000 years, 100,000 years – it’s reasonable to assume that the difference between reality and simulation will become indistinguishable. At which point it will mean we will have created simulated beings with their own consciousness.

But if that is the inevitable outcome of continued technological advancement, unless nuclear war or some other catastrophe intervenes, then it’s quite possible – some would say an overwhelming certainty – that it’s already happened, and we are the ancestor simulations created by an advanced post-human civilisation.

That’s a mind-blowing thought, but it’s one that the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, for example, has explored. His conclusion is that it’s a “billions to one chance that we’re not living in a simulation [my italics]”.

Musk, the man behind the electric car company Tesla, and SpaceX, which aims to send manned missions to Mars, is not stupid. He’s estimated to be worth about $14bn and that money has come from the commercial exploitation of technological innovations. He is funding a massive global study of AI. He’s a man with his eye firmly fixed on the future and all its rich potential.

So when he says that he believes we are already living in a simulation, it’s not quite the same as, say, David Icke claiming that we are being tyrannised by a secret brotherhood of shape-shifting reptiles. However, rather worryingly, it doesn’t sound all that different. And this is one of the problems with the simulation hypothesis. Although it is a perfectly logical argument, because it is unfalsifiable, it gives rise to all manner of possibilities, many of them as far-fetched as Icke’s villainous lizard people.

Throw in the complications of multiverse theories and you’re looking at a near infinite number of simulated realities, within which there may be countless other simulations, including the one in which I stand in a Euston office block with a headset on, chasing a ball and balancing on a high-rise walkway.

Yuval Noah Harari: ‘Homo sapiens as we know them will disappear in a century or so’ Read more

The simulation hypothesis has entered the culture as an explanatory meme. Writing in the New Yorker earlier this year, the critic Adam Gopnik suggested that the Oscar confusion, in which La La Land was wrongly given the best film award meant for Moonlight, the election of Donald Trump, and the improbable late comeback by the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl showed “that we are living in the matrix, and something has gone wrong with the controllers”.

It was, of course, a lighthearted piece, but it raised a serious point. If we are in a simulation, then is there a possibility that, like any other computer software, it’s prone to glitches? And also could events like the second world war be explained by a programmatic failure, or is whoever is in control of the simulation an evil demon in the Cartesian sense?

(In The Matrix, the machines initially make a utopian simulation, but the humans don’t believe in the reality, so it is adjusted to include all the pain and drama humans associate with being alive.)

Bostrom estimates that there is only a 20% chance that we are living in a simulation. But that isn’t necessarily good news. As Musk likes to point out: “Either we’re going to create simulations that are indistinguishable from reality or civilisation will cease to exist. Those are the only two options.”

Actually there’s a third option, which is that for some reason or other we’ll grow bored with running billions of ancestor simulations, and that virtual reality will become passé.

That’s something to consider while pondering whether or not to splash out on some VR entertainment. In 10,000 years’ time, it might be completely out of fashion.

Five other mind-bending theories

The universe is a hologram

In a nutshell: Everything we see and experience is an illusion. Our 3D reality is encoded on a two-dimensional surface that we cannot see.

Evidence? Earlier this year, scientists from the University of Southampton claimed to have found support for this theory by studying the cosmic background radiation left over from the big bang.

Multiverse theory

In a nutshell: There are infinite universes, including the one we live in. There are various classifications and theories about the types of multiverse that might exist.

Evidence? Although proponents include Neil deGrasse Tyson and Stephen Hawking (who two years ago suggested that there might be an alternate universe in which Zayn Malik had not left One Direction), the theory by its very nature is essentially considered impossible to prove.

Ekpyrotic universe theory

In a nutshell: The big bang was actually a transition from a previous period of contraction to the present period of expansion. The key events that shaped our universe happened before the big bang and the universe is in a constant cycle of expansion and contraction.

Evidence? In 2001, scientists from Princeton University put forward the concept based on unproved ideas from string theory. Though it is still widely rejected, the discovery that the Higgs boson is only 98% of the mass required to keep the universe stable apparently lends the theory some credence.

White holes

In a nutshell: If black holes exist then their opposite must exist too: white holes are thought to be constantly emitting matter and light, letting nothing enter them.

Evidence? There has yet to be any observational evidence of white holes, though a paper published in 2011 posited that the big bang was a white hole and that gamma-ray bursts might also be white holes.

Quantum entanglement

In a nutshell: Two particles can be linked to each other even if separated by billions of light years of space and a change induced in one will affect the other.

Evidence? During the 1930s, Einstein called it “spooky action at a distance” and considered it to be impossible. However, most physicists today accept it to be true. Tara Joshi",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/17/el-paso-texas-beto-orourke-donald-trump-nafta-mexico,"As the president threatens a ‘border adjustment tax’, Beto O’Rourke has set his sights on Ted Cruz’s Senate seat with a defense of free trade typical of El Pasoans, who describe Trump’s anti-Mexican rhetoric as ‘deeply personal’

The Star-Spangled Banner is the Mount Everest of national anthems – many attempt it, but few ever hit its peak. In a school theater on the hot and dusty outskirts of El Paso, Texas, high school student Gisselle Castaneda nails the high notes to a hearty round of applause from the 100 or so locals gathered to meet their congressman, Beto O’Rourke.

These are strange days in El Paso, the pretty little border town that has acted as the bridge to Mexico for 169 years. El Paso and its Mexican neighbor, Ciudad Juarez, pretty much function as a single unit. At the end of El Paso Street, a bridge, Paso del Norte, groans with some of the 200,000-plus vehicles that cross it from Mexico each month. Another 400,000-plus walk over: they come to work, shop, go to school or visit friends and relatives, as they have done for centuries.

Now a giant, blimp-like shadow hangs over El Paso: Donald Trump. During his campaign, Trump railed against Mexican drug pushers and “rapists” and promised to build a “big, beautiful wall” to keep out the city’s southern neighbors. Since his election he has threatened to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which cut barriers between Mexico, the US and Canada and which many here say has helped El Paso thrive. Now he is threatening a “border adjustment tax” on goods coming in from Mexico, a tax that he says will pay for the wall and that critics say could trigger a trade war that would hit El Paso first but then spread across the US and the world.



At O’Rourke’s town hall meeting, locals are worried. Student Ray Dominguez was born and raised in El Paso and like many here has family in Juarez. “El Paso has always been a very accepting place. Trump is dividing people. The one good thing I would say is that we are more proud of who we are,” he says.

And in this topsy turvy political climate, when a Republican president rails against free trade, the climate change-accepting, LGBT-friendly, free trade-loving O’Rourke is having a moment.

A rising Democrat star who the Washington Post recently said “looks more like a Kennedy than the Kennedys do”, O’Rourke is set to challenge the oleaginous Ted Cruz for his Senate seat in 2018. When he does, O’Rourke will be the man arguing for free trade while his Republican rival, Trump’s one-time chief critic and now frenemy, will be left defending Republican policies that O’Rourke (and many far to the right of him) argue threaten not just the economy but American safety.

Not a brick of Trump’s monumental wall has been laid, no details of the “border adjustment tax” have been finalized and Nafta still stands, but the impact of all this anti-trade, anti-Mexican rhetoric is already being felt in the region, says O’Rourke.



On the Mexican side of the border there are organized campaigns encouraging shoppers to stay in Mexico. El Paso’s retail trade is worth $12.24bn a year, and some $980m of that comes from residents of northern Mexico. On the US side, fear is keeping some undocumented people inside and out of the local economy. “The fear is that a broken tail light, an arbitrary arrest, could land people in a deportation proceeding. So people aren’t going out to buy a bucket of chicken, a six-pack, get those diapers or whatever. There’s less cooperation with law enforcement, people just don’t feel comfortable dealing with law enforcement,” says O’Rourke.

“It’s changing the character and the safety of a community like El Paso. Before it didn’t matter what your immigration status was, whether you were born here or not you felt comfortable working with law enforcement to report a crime or abuse,” he says. “They knew law enforcement was focused on keeping us safe. Now that focus has changed and ironically it is making us less safe.”



Robert Moore, editor of the El Paso Times, agrees. The Times recently reported on the case of an undocumented woman who had sought a court order against a man she accused of abusing her. The alleged abuser told immigration and customs enforcement (Ice) that she was undocumented and when she would be appearing in court. Agents arrested her as she left the courthouse. “Trump might say that is what he wants to happen but for us, that’s deeply upsetting,” says Moore, who sits on the board of the Center Against Sexual and Family Violence and expects the case to have a chilling effect on reports of abuse.



Like many El Pasoans, Moore is prone to wax lyrical about the good old days when the border was little more than a mild inconvenience. When Moore started his career in the city, he and his colleagues would nip across the border for cheap beers and pool after work. Crossing into Mexico is still fairly quick, but coming back in a car it can take hours to drive the six short miles that divide the two cities. It’s not all Trump’s fault; border security has been on the rise since 9/11 and was considerably beefed up as Juarez was torn apart by drug-related gun violence a decade ago.

The proposed wall doesn’t seem to faze locals at all. Firstly, they argue it will be a boost to the local economy. A $20bn wall would inject $10bn into the Texas economy and create 144,000 jobs, says Tom Fullerton, economics professor at the University of Texas at El Paso. “But over the long run it won’t have much impact at all,” he says.

Locals don’t think it will have much impact on drug trade or illegal entries. Drug smugglers are already using mini cannons like the ones used to fire T-shirts into the crowds at sports events to fire their drugs over the border. What they can’t go over, they’ll go under. More tunnels will be dug.

But El Pasoans are genuinely angered by Trump’s constant attacks on their neighbors and his portrayal of a wild west border that few here recognise. “It’s deeply personal,” says Moore. “People here feel he’s not just attacking the border, he’s attacking me. Everyone in El Paso knows someone who is undocumented and the way this administration has talked about them is seen as really insulting.”



It's deeply personal. People here feel Trump's not just attacking the border, he’s attacking me Robert Moore, editor of the El Paso Times

That’s not to say that many in El Paso do not sympathize with Trump’s supporters. The city was one of the first victims of globalization and profoundly impacted by Nafta, says Fullerton.



Once the jeans capital of the US and home to manufacturers including Levi Strauss and Farah – at its peak the second largest employer in the city – El Paso fell on hard times as trade barriers fell and manufacturing jobs went south of the border. But the city bounced back. The unemployment rate in El Paso was close to 12% when Nafta was signed in 1994 and it is now less than 5%. “The border region has benefitted from Nafta; so has the entire country,” says Fullerton.

Mexican trade is vital to Texas. Some $98bn in exports and imports passed through the El Paso customs district in 2015. According to the Dallas Federal Reserve, a 10% increase in manufacturing on the Mexican side of the border increases employment by 2.8% in El Paso, 2.2% in neighbouring Brownsville, 4.6% in Laredo and 6.6% in McAllen.

“People want simple solutions. They want to be told, ‘Don’t worry, we will sort it,” says Fullerton. But economics is not simple. And neither, right now, is politics.

Washington is in Easter recess and while Trump plays golf in Florida, the rightwing billionaire Koch brothers are spending millions backing ads attacking his border tax plans, arguing they amount to a consumer tax that will increase costs on everything from clothes and TVs to food and will land the average US family with a $1,700 bill. The ads are playing nationwide in states that elected a president who promised them change but who now, the Kochs argue, is threatening their livelihoods and their pocketbooks.

Attacking from the left is O’Rourke. “The five states that would be hurt by a border adjustment tax, which would essentially precipitate a trade war, are mid-western states, states like Michigan. Factory floor jobs in Detroit are inextricably connected to factory floor jobs in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. If you break that connection with a tax or you continue to try to humiliate Mexico, you jeopardize not just jobs in Mexico and El Paso but in Michigan and across the United States.”

What was once a proposed 20% border tax may well end up being something far smaller, says Fullerton, but he still believes there is a good chance that some sort of tax is coming. “The sentiment in the country is so anti-trade that I think Congress would be reluctant to vote against a serious proposal,” he says.

In the baking-hot parking lot of the College, Career and Technology Academy O’Rourke, the left-leaning liberal Democrat, sets out the case for free trade and against new taxes. America needs to listen to Trump’s supporters. Too many have been left behind, he says. But they need retraining not tariffs. “We need not be paranoid and fearful of the future, of other countries. That’s not America. That’s not Texas.” This is a “dark time” he says. “But I am confident it is getting better.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/17/facebook-live-murder-crime-policy,"Question of the social network’s role in amplifying crime has intensified after it took several hours to remove a brutal video seen millions of times

“This is a horrific crime and we do not allow this kind of content on Facebook.”

The “content” the Facebook spokesperson was referring to was the apparent killing of 74-year-old grandfather Robert Godwin, shot at close range in Cleveland on Sunday afternoon as he walked home from an Easter meal with his family. Godwin’s suspected attacker, 37-year-old Steve Stephens, filmed a first-person view of the shooting and uploaded it to his Facebook page, where it remained for more than two hours before being taken down – not before the video had been copied, reposted and viewed millions of times.

The victim’s grandson, Ryan Godwin, begged people on Twitter to stop sharing the footage, saying “that is my grandfather, show some respect”.

Ryan A. Godwin (@god_winr) Please please please stop retweeting that video and report anyone who has posted it! That is my grandfather show some respect #Cleveland

The case yet again raises questions about the social networking site’s ability to moderate content, particularly when there is an active crime unfolding.

The incident comes on the eve of Facebook’s F8, an annual event for developers, and at a time when the company is working hard to promote its role as an enabler of civic engagement. Two months ago, CEO Mark Zuckerberg penned a 5,700-word manifesto outlining measures the social network was taking to address several challenges faced by humanity.

Within the letter, Zuckerberg explained that the company is researching systems that use artificial intelligence to look at photos and videos to flag content for review. “This is still very early in development, but we have started to have it look at some content, and it already generates about one-third of all reports to the team that reviews content for our community,” he said.

Facebook did not respond to the Guardian about whether these automated systems played a role in identifying the murder video.

This is far from the first time that Facebook has amplified a crime in real time. Last month a 15-year-old girl was raped by multiple people in Chicago, an attack that was streamed on Facebook Live. In January three men were arrested in relation to a similar incident involving the live-streamed rape of a woman in Sweden. Last year 23-year-old Korryn Gaines used Facebook to broadcast a standoff with police in Baltimore, which ended in the mother of one being shot and killed. Facebook has also hosted videos showing the torture of a young man with disabilities in Chicago, the musings of a spree killer being chased by police, child abuse and now murder.

“There have been beatings, rapes, suicide … other incidents seemed to be building to this,” said Sarah T Roberts, an information studies professor from UCLA who studies large-scale moderation of online platforms.

“The question I have is at what point do we transfer some of the responsibility for these acts to the platform?”

Terrorists, protestors and narcissistic criminals have always used the media to ensure that “performance” crimes make maximum impact. What’s different now is the access people have to tools – via their smartphone – to create, publish and distribute content at the touch of the button. Committing a crime for an audience has never been easier.

“Social media removes the gatekeepers between performance and distribution,” said Raymond Surette, professor of criminal justice at the University of Central Florida, who has studied the phenomenon. “It’s an avenue for certain types of offenders to get their message out totally unedited.”

The attention from online peers, combined with immediate feedback in the form of comments, reactions and shares, can be intoxicating. The fact that the footage is self-incriminating doesn’t matter to some offenders.

“Being famous for being a bad person is more acceptable for some people than being an unknown good person,” said Surette, adding that if the 9/11 terrorists “had the capability to live-stream their hijackings and plane explosions they would have done it”.

Surette doesn’t think there’s much Facebook can do to prevent footage of these crimes from being uploaded (“If you get an obscene phone call you don’t blame the phone company,” he said) but does believe the company has a responsibility to take videos and live streams down as quickly as possible.

Why a rising number of criminals are using Facebook Live to film their acts Read more

“The less time it’s up there, the less likely it’s going to generate a copycat,” he said.

On Monday afternoon Facebook published a blog post outlining a timeline of what happened, highlighting the fact that Stephens posted three videos in total: the first announcing his intent to commit a murder, then a second, two minutes later, of the killing itself, followed by a live stream confessing to the act.

“As a result of this terrible series of events, we are reviewing our reporting flows to be sure people can report videos and other material that violates our standards as easily and quickly as possible,” said Justin Osofsky, vice-president of operations.

Osofsky said that no Facebook users reported the first video and that the company only received a report about the second video more than an hour and 45 minutes after it was posted.

“We disabled the suspect’s account within 23 minutes of receiving the first report about the murder video, and two hours after receiving a report of any kind. But we know we need to do better.”

In addition to improving reporting flows, Facebook will use artificial intelligence to prevent the same content from being re-shared and pledged to improve its review process.

Beyond Facebook’s responsibility, the fact that footage of the murder has been viewed so widely – with one version of the video seen more than 1.6m times – highlights an ugly side of human nature.

“It’s the same reason people slow down to watch a car crash,” Surette said. “The dark side is an attraction for everybody.”

Of course not everyone wants to slow down and gape at gore, but the nature of content sharing on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms means the viral murder video – converted in some places into an autoplaying Gif – was foisted into people’s timelines.

“The way this material is often interrupted is because someone like you or me encounters it,” Roberts said. “This means a whole bunch of people saw it and flagged it, contributing their own labour and non-consensual exposure to something horrendous. How are we going to deal with community members who may have seen that and are traumatized today?”

Stephens remains on the run. Cleveland police urged residents of Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana and Michigan to be on alert.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/29/brexit-rights-of-eu-nationals-eu27,"European leaders take hard line on Brexit at special summit, agreeing unanimously on rigid stance in just four minutes

The European Union has called on Theresa May to provide immediate “serious and real” guarantees to its citizens living in Britain. The EU leaders took just four minutes at a special summit to agree unanimously an uncompromising opening stance in the Brexit negotiations.

Leaders said they would not discuss a future trade deal with the British government until “sufficient progress” is made on the issues of Britain’s estimated €60bn divorce bill, the rights of EU nationals in the UK, and the border in Ireland.

The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told reporters at the special summit in Brussels that EU citizens in Britain were the number one priority, and that he had discussed the need for Britain to now live up to its warm words regarding EU citizens during a dinner with the prime minister in Downing Street last week.

“We have already prepared a text that could be adopted immediately if our British friends would be willing to sign it, but that probably won’t happen,” Juncker told reporters, adding that there was an element of tragedy in the situation of some in the UK.

“I have the impression sometimes that our British friends, not all of them, do underestimate the technical difficulties we have to face,” he said, adding that May had told him, to each of his questions about the future: “Be patient and ambitious.”

Donald Tusk, president of the European council, whose members comprise the EU states, added: “For the past weeks we have heard from our British friends, also during my visit in London, that they are ready to agree on this issue quickly.

“I would like to state very clearly that we need real guarantees for our people who live, work and study in the UK and the same goes for the Brits. The commission has prepared a full list of the rights and benefits that we want to guarantee for those affected by Brexit. To achieve sufficient progress we need a serious British response.”

The two EU leaders were speaking after European leaders agreed in record time to adopt nine pages of negotiating guidelines at a special summit in Brussels.

Responding to the summit’s conclusions, David Davis, the secretary of state for exiting the European Union, said that he feared the coming talks would be “confrontational” and echoed May’s comments last week about member states “lining up to oppose us”.

He said: “Both sides are clear: we want these negotiations to be conducted in a spirit of goodwill, sincere cooperation and with the aim of establishing a close partnership between the UK and the EU going forward.

“But there is no doubt that these negotiations are the most complex the UK has faced in our lifetimes. They will be tough and at times even confrontational. There are already people in Europe who oppose these aims and people at home trying to undermine them. That is why it is so important that the UK has the right leadership in place.”

Speaking in the margins of the summit, leaders had taken turns all day to warn the British government that the EU was unified and would fight hard for the interests of its member states. The French president, François Hollande, told reporters: “There will inevitably be a price and a cost for Britain; it’s the choice they made.

“We must not be punitive, but at the same time it’s clear that Europe knows how to defend its interests, and that Britain will have a less good position outside the EU than in the EU.”

Asked about her suggestion last week that some in the UK were deluded about the coming talks, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she feared there was a lack of understanding about the EU’s resolve to only talk about trade once the opening issues had been resolved.

Merkel also appeared unconvinced by May’s claim that a landslide election victory would strengthen her negotiating position in the talks when they start in June, although she applauded the prime minister for calling it.

“The British prime minster thinks that a clear vote [in the general election] will strengthen her position in the negotiations,” she said. “It will certainly give her a very credible platform. The election has removed this sword of Damocles over the negotiations.”

Other leaders also appeared bemused by the prime minister’s claims about being empowered by an election triumph. Hollande, who is now in his last week as president, said: “That is an election argument that I can understand. But this is not an argument against the European Union. Why? Because the bases, the principles, the objectives are already fixed: these will be the lines that will be chosen by the negotiators and there will be no others.”

Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, claimed May had called the election to resolve an internal problem in the Conservative party.

She wanted “not a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit but Theresa’s Brexit,” he said. Joseph Muscat, the prime minister of Malta, added: “I wouldn’t want to intrude in the prime minister’s decisions but the fact is we are wasting one month now.”

EU leaders at the summit also agreed a declaration that would allow northern Ireland to swiftly rejoin the EU, in the event of a vote for Irish unification. With polls showing that a majority of voters in Northern Ireland want to stay part of the UK, the Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, said the clause was not about triggering a poll.

“I have always been very clear that the conditions for a referendum do not currently exist, but the endorsement of the principle, the potential agreement of the Good Friday agreement is hugely important.”

The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it was in Britain’s interests for the EU to be unified, as it would boost the chances of a Brexit deal. “This extraordinary meeting shows the unity of the 27 on a clear line, but this unity is not directed against Britain; I think that it is also in its interest,” he said.",guardian.com,False

Sharp spring frosts are damaging production in some of France’s most famous winemaking regions, including Champagne, Bordeaux and Burgundy, posing a threat to growers’ incomes.



Vineyards report temperatures plunged in all three regions last week, sometimes to below -7C (19°F), hurting shoots already well-developed because of earlier mild weather, and growers fear a new cold snap could cause more damage.

They have been using candles, heaters and even the down-draught from helicopters to try to save crops.

French wine harvest among the smallest for 30 years Read more

“All areas of the Champagne are hit to very varying degrees,” said Thibaut Le Mailloux from the Champagne Committee (CIVC) industry group. “It’s too early to estimate the extent of the damage, but the frost impact is worse than last year’s”.

France’s total wine output fell 10% last year due to adverse weather conditions. Champagne was the worst hit, with the harvest down more than 20% on the previous year due to spring frosts followed by other problems such as mildew.

CIVC said that on average 20 to 25% of vine shoots had been destroyed in Champagne by Tuesday, against 14% last year. That estimate did not take into account potential damage from overnight frosts in the past two days.

Le Mailloux noted, however, that producers could use reserves from previous harvests if necessary. Unlike many other wines, Champagne is often made of wine from several harvests.

In the Bordeaux region, farm unions estimated that several thousand hectares of vineyards across the region, out of a total of 115,000ha, had been hit by last week’s frosts, with some experiencing damage between 50 and 100%.

“Today we are likely seeing the most important freeze since 1991. And there are more frosts forecast for the coming night,” Patrick Vasseur, vice chairman of the FDSEA33, the local branch of France’s largest farm union FNSEA, said.

The entire Cognac vineyard has also been severely impacted, industry group BNIC said, calling the situation “very worrying,” with new frosts forecast for tonight. A more precise estimate of the extent of the damage will be made next week.

In the Bugey region near Lyon, winemakers said the damage was extensive, with some vineyards totally destroyed.

“The vineyard was three weeks ahead in its growth, shoots were already well developed. Frost destroyed everything - shoots are dead,” Julien Hubail, expert at the Bugey wine union, said.

“In winemakers’ memory it had never happened, no one had ever experienced such a severe freeze.”",guardian.com,False

A respected Christian human rights lawyer has been convicted of “subversion of state power” at a secret trial in China, almost two years after he was first detained in a sweeping crackdown.



Li Heping was sentenced to three years in prison with a four-year reprieve, the court in the eastern city of Tianjin said on an official social media account, meaning he should be released but could be arrested and jailed at any point.

The trial was held behind closed doors on Tuesday because “the case involved state secrets”, the court said, but was only announced along with the verdict on Friday.

'I want to rescue my dad': children's heartbreak for the lawyers China has taken away Read more

Li was swept up in a nationwide crackdown on rights lawyers and activists in July 2015, where police detained or questioned about 250 people. Since assuming power, China’s president, Xi Jinping, has launched a new wave of attacks on activists and the lawyers who defend them.

Li’s case drew attention around the world, and EU officials, as well as the embassies of 11 countries, called for his claims of torture while in custody to be investigated. His wife has said authorities used electric shocks on him.

“A suspended sentence does not mean he’s free until we actually get to see him and he’s allowed to speak freely, and given what we’ve seen in the past that probably won’t happen,” said Eva Pils, a professor at King’s College London and longtime friend of Li.

“It was a secret trial so we don’t know what state he is in,” Pils added. “In addition to our usual concerns about torture and physical health, I’m worried that this entire process may have robbed him of his mental health, especially after what they’ve apparently done to his brother.”

Li’s younger brother, Li Chunfu, emerged from 500 days of secret detention in January and was later diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to his family.

Li became well known for defending the disenfranchised, including Christian house churches, victims of forced evictions and free speech advocates. He worked within the scope of China’s legal system, rather than taking to the streets in protest. One Chinese security agent reportedly once told Li that the state considered him “more dangerous than Bin Laden”.

Although Li is likely to be released in the coming weeks, he has already spent more than 20 months in detention. At least 11 activists who received suspended sentences disappeared shortly after they were released, with some forced to undergo months of political education classes before being placed under house arrest by local police, according to human rights groups.

The court’s verdict was seen as a warning to other activists, and included a catalogue of vague charges, without citing any specific examples of illegality.

“The court ruled that since 2008, the defendant Li Heping repeatedly used the internet and foreign media interviews to discredit and attack state power and the legal system,” the court said. The court also accused Li of accepting foreign funds and employing paid defendants.

A lawyer hired by Li’s family to defend him was rejected by authorities and he was ultimately given a government appointed lawyer, an increasing trend in political prosecutions.

The conviction came on the same day that another civil rights lawyer, Xie Yang, was set to go on trial, but it was later cancelled.",guardian.com,False

In an age of epic corruption and political cynicism in Brazil, a new browser plug-in aims to attract and inform voters about the extent of their representatives’ involvement in graft.

Released before what is expected to be the biggest general strike in decades, Colour of Corruption is an online political scorecard that details criminal allegations against members of the cabinet, the upper and lower houses of parliament, state governors, their deputies – and even the president.

It comes in the midst of the biggest bribery investigation in Brazil’s history. Operação Lava Jato, or Operation Carwash, which started in 2014, has revealed a massive system of kickbacks and corruption involving almost all of the major political parties and dozens of leading companies, including the state oil giant Petrobras.

The latest revelations – detailed with shocking nonchalance by executives from the Odebrecht construction conglomerate – have prompted the supreme court to authorise investigations into eight ministers from President Michel Temer’s cabinet, as well as five former presidents.

Launched this week, the Google Chrome plug-in paints a vivid purple band over the name of any senior politician facing any kind of investigation. A click then reveals legal processes the politician is facing.

It is seen as a sign of a social and technological fightback against deep-rooted corruption and impunity, particularly when public resentment towards the government has been inflamed by controversial plans for pension reform.

Other sites and applications have targeted graft. During last year’s municipal elections, Brazil’s electoral court released an app for people to denounce electoral irregularities. But Colour of Corruption was launched by one of Brazil’s most popular consumer complaints sites Reclame Aqui, or Complain Here, which says 600,000 people check it every day.

Launched in 2001, Complain Here grew in importance during Brazil’s economic boom, when consumer spending soared but companies often failed to deliver what they had promised. Many Brazilians found posting a complaint on Complain Here more effective than contacting brands directly and also use it to check company reputations.

Now, with Brazil bogged down in the third year of a recession, consumers are turning their attention to democracy, said Iago Bolivar, director of operations for the Complain Here Institute, which is behind the launch.

“The country was very focused on consumption,” Bolivar said. “Brazilians are very focused now on citizenship.”

Information on legal cases is generally available, Bolivar said, but locating it in Brazil’s labyrinthine and cumbersome justice system to too complex for many. “We do not have a transparent justice system,” he said. “Even though this information is in a way available it is very difficult for the common citizen to access.”

After setting up an initial data bank with non-profit group Transparência Brasil (Brazil Transparency), the institute has partnered with the Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná State, in southern Brazil. Now 250 students from the university are upgrading the database with a team of lawyers and journalists, Bolivar said. The next step is to add thousands of mayors and state deputies.

Sylvio Costa, founder of Congress in Focus, a Brasília-based watchdog site, said the initiative will ratchet up the pressure on politicians already stressed by the overload of corruption allegations.

“They certainly won’t like it. But this is a war in which society has advanced more than the politicians,” Costa said. The problem will be keeping track of thousands of constantly-changing legally processes. “To do a system like this efficiently, you have to keep it permanently up to date,” he said.

The context is crucial. Last year, millions took to the streets to protest against the former Workers Party president Dilma Rousseff, who was subsequently impeached. Her replacement, Temer, has proven just as unpopular, with ratings now in single digits, and a third of his cabinet implicated in graft, or corruption.

This Friday, the country’s schools, hospitals and transport systems are expected to be paralysed by a general strike against social security reforms. While corruption is not the main rallying cry, it is a major reason for the public reluctance to accept the changes that politicians are trying to impose.

”If we cannot trust the government, why should we trust their message that this reform is unavoidable?” said Fernando Limongi, a Political Scientist at the University of São Paulo.

Whether greater knowledge of corruption will mobilise people has been debated. Nara Pavão, a professor in the political science department at the Federal University of Pernambuco, warned there was a danger that voters could feel the problems are so entrenched that they cannot be solved.

However, Pavão said the government’s unpopular efforts to reform the social security system – which is the major issue in this Friday’s strike – conveyed the impression that politicians were not just selfishly trying to enrich themselves, but had had a malign impact on the public.

“Corruption is not the motive of the strike but it plays a part. The feeling is that not only are the politicians corrupt, but now they are also actively working against them. It shows politicians are failing to consider the voters point of view.It is a problem of representation.”

Flávia Biroli, a professor at the University of Brasilia, said problems were particularly evident in the Temer administration because it was more detached from the public than any of its predecessors.

“There is more at stake than the enrichment of politicians and businessmen, what is at stake is the functioning of Brazilian democracy and its susceptibility to the interests of big business.”",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/apr/25/inequality-project-guardian-in-depth-look-unequal-world-equality,"Today we kick off a new project investigating inequality of all kinds , all over the world. Here’s how we plan to approach it – and how you can get involved

Inequality is all around us – some all-too visible, much of it obscure and insidious. Experts are lining up in ever-greater numbers to warn of its harmful effects – from Professor Stephen Hawking, who wrote in the Guardian of technology’s role in growing levels of income inequality, to Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, who told the world’s business leaders earlier this year: “I hope people will listen [to my warnings] now.”

Not everyone is listening, though – in part because the picture can be very confusing. In the UK, for instance, the Office for National Statistics revealed the gap between the richest and poorest fifths of society fell significantly last year. However, it also said Britain’s generational divide is growing, with a boost to pension payments masking the continued struggle of many other households.

In Australia, the country’s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, has highlighted her concerns about the “surprising and concerning” prevalence of opposition to advancing gender equality. And in the US, a new book by Professor Tom Shapiro, Toxic Inequality, reveals how ingrained, systemic racism is responsible for the widening gap between the wealth of white and African American households.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said Justine Greening.

It was the latest reminder of the enduring impact of an individual’s family background on their long-term prospects. In January, research by the Social Mobility Commission showed that, on average, professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 a year less than those from wealthier backgrounds.

Beyond capitalism and socialism: could a new economic approach save the planet? Read more

Social mobility is often considered an educational issue, but it is clear from the Commission’s findings that employers have a big role to play too. Not only do rich people get a disproportionate number of top jobs, but inequality also exists among colleagues with exactly the same role, education and experience. On average, those from poorer families will earn 7% less than their peers, equivalent to around £2,242 a year.

A range of theories have been advanced to explain the gap, including education differences, access to networks and class discrimination, as well as other, more specific factors. For instance, the Social Mobility Commission said that people from poorer backgrounds are less likely to ask for pay rises and sometimes even exclude themselves from promotion out of a fear of not fitting in.

Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre which campaigns for greater income equality, says businesses need to do more to tackle the problem. “Britain has been struggling with this for such a long time,” he says. “There are occasional shifts and improvements, but it’s such a long-term, deep-seated thing – and it’s not clear to me that it’s getting any better.”

Plenty of businesses claim to be making an effort. In fact, more than 190 employers have signed up to the government’s Social Mobility Business Compact scheme, which aims to “address elitism and improve social mobility by encouraging businesses to open up opportunities to everyone”.

As one of the lead signatories, Deloitte has introduced new ways to broaden out its recruitment. “We strongly believe that a person’s background shouldn’t dictate their future,” says Emma Codd, managing partner for talent. “A socially diverse workforce is a critical business and economic imperative and we believe that we have an important part to play.”

Among other initiatives, Deloitte has introduced a policy of university-blind recruitment, to try to minimise any elitist bias. And, since 2015, it uses so-called “contextualised academic data”. The idea, it says, is that qualifications are considered in parallel with the circumstances they were attained in. So, for instance, three Bs at A Level would be recognised as exceptional if the school average was three Ds.

Just pay more

Despite official backing for such schemes – the government has granted ‘champion’ status to Deloitte, Linklaters, Telefónica and a number of other firms pledging to increase opportunities for people from lower-income backgrounds – some observers are sceptical about their potential to tackle the class pay gap.

“The real test is not just who they recruit, but who’s there five or 10 years later and what’s happened to them,” says Stern. “It’s a systemic problem, and short-term and PR measures aren’t going to change anything.”

Lee Elliot Major, CEO of the Sutton Trust, a thinktank focused on social mobility, agrees. “We seem to be going backwards in the workplace rather than forwards. It’s not just wages, it’s also whether the jobs have progression in them. We’re almost going back to Victorian times in terms of inequality and opportunity.

“Companies need to think not just about access into the workplace, but how [employees] progress thereafter.”

As a starting point, says Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, businesses can help social mobility simply by paying better wages to lower-paid workers. With less stress about how to make ends meet, it can be easier to concentrate on securing the next career step or promotion, she argues.

https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/apr/27/how-to-protect-yourself-from-ageist-attitudes,"With one third of adults saying they have experienced ageism at work, how can people protect themselves from discrimination?

When Lucy Shaw*, now 41, was approached by an agent interested in signing her to a radio show she loved, she was excited. But when she told him her age he didn’t react well. “When he realised I was 30, his face and attitude changed completely,” Shaw says. “He said, obviously at my age I’d be thinking about getting married and having kids, and that wouldn’t work with his ideas.”

Eight years later, Shaw applied for another job in the industry and was one of the final three applicants. However, once again, her age meant she didn’t get it. “They said they wanted to go with someone younger,” she says. “I came off the phone and burst into tears.” Reluctantly, she changed career soon after. “It completely put me off,” she says.

One in five adults believe they’ve experienced ageism in the UK, with three out of 10 experiencing it at work, according to research by the BBC. People aged 55-64 experience it most, followed by 18-34 year-olds . Women can also face the double discrimination of combined ageism and sexism, according to the Labour commission on older women.

People assume somehow your skills disappear when you get to 40 James Ratcliffe

So what is age discrimination? Who does it effect? And how can we protect ourselves from it in the workplace?

Ageism can affect anyone

Anyone can experience ageism, young or old. And it doesn’t have to be linked to a person’s actual age – if someone is perceived to be a certain age, and suffers discrimination because of that, then that qualifies as ageism. Sarah Jones, 27, a medical sales rep, worries that looking young affects her chances of getting a promotion. “Once I was taken along on job training with my boss,” she says. “And a customer asked in a very patronising tone if I was my boss’s daughter on work experience. It was mortifying. I’m going for a promotion at the moment and I think people think I’m very young. It would be easier if I looked my age.”

Older people may be most at risk, however, with one in three experiencing ageism, according to research by UCL. After 14 years in the civil service Michael Barnes* was made redundant and replaced by a younger employee. Aged 56 at the time, he says he is sure he and other colleagues were let go because of their ages. “It stood out like a sore thumb, we were being got rid of because we were over 50,” he says. “I haven’t worked since, even though I applied for things solidly for over two years. I’ve got no qualifications but masses of experience. I’m still angry about what happened 11 years later.”

James Ratcliffe, 54, says in some industries older people’s skills aren’t valued at all. “I was working at a creative agency when I was in my late 40s and within about 20 minutes of sitting down someone emailed and asked how old I was,” he says. “There’s nothing I can do in that situation. I can’t second guess what she thinks, you just have to do your best work. I think ageism is really common, particularly for older people. People assume somehow your skills disappear when you get to 40.”

What can you do if you experience ageism?

People are protected against ageism under the Equality Act. So if you experience it, you can lodge a formal grievance against your employer, and if that fails, bring a claim to an employment tribunal, says Philip Landau, employment lawyer at Landau Law Solicitors.

Ageism can be direct or indirect. “Indirect discrimination might be a job advert that says you need 10 years of experience,” says Julie Freeborn, an occupational psychologist and chair of the British Psychological Society division of occupational psychology. Whereas direct discrimination, for example, would be having a request for a pay rise rejected, because the boss says you’re on good money for your age, Freeborn says.

Age is an important piece of the diversity discussion Brandon Smith

The first challenge can be identifying ageism for what it is. “It’s difficult to spot,” says Brandon Smith, founder of advice website the Workplace Therapist. “But remember, three of anything is a pattern.” One way to figure out if someone is harbouring ageist attitudes towards you is to keep a log. “Write down anything you consider to be discrimination,” says Freeborn.

Unconscious biases are at the root of ageism, says David Shindler, founder of online school Career Navigating for Young Professionals. “We’ve all got our prejudices,” he says. “Part of the trick to tackling them is to make them conscious. You’re never going to eradicate some of those biases but you can get people talking about it and doing something about it.”

If you do decide to speak to someone in work about their attitude towards you, try to stay calm, says Freeborn. “The conversation obviously can be quite difficult,” she says. “Present it in a neutral way as far as possible and if you have a log you can give them that evidence.”

How can you protect yourself against ageist attitudes?

Building a good relationship with colleagues, as much as possible, helps. “This is probably the first thing you can do before it gets out of hand,” Smith says. “You want to break down those walls and let people get to know you. Go to lunch with them and demystify any myths.”

Working on your skills can also put you in a strong position. “It’s about changing perceptions,” says Shindler. “For example, if you’re an older worker, the stereotype might be that you’re not as technologically savvy, so spend time training yourself on technology and working it into what you do to show you’re not out of date.”

Ultimately though, the responsibility is on employers to value age diversity and take steps to prevent discrimination. “Age is an important piece of the diversity discussion,” says Smith. “We must have a variety of ages, because each age brings a different perspective. So this is about having a diverse, healthy workplace, and age is a huge part of that.”

Shaw says she’s got more confident as she’s got older – making her a better employeein the new career she pursued in communications . “Ironically, I have a lot more confidence and I’m more at ease with myself now than I was when I worked in radio,” she says, “and I think I’d be far better at it now than I was then.”

https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/22/chicken-farmers-big-poultry-rules,"More than 97% of US chicken farmers work with a big producer, but many say they’re being treated unfairly – and rules to help protect them are now in limbo

Back in 2001, Alton Terry, his wife and two young children were living in San Jose, California, but they dreamed of a quieter, more rural life. Terry’s grandparents had been farmers, and that inspired him to move his family to Shelbyville, Tennessee, to start a chicken farm.

Like the majority of chicken farmers in the US, Terry entered into an exclusive contract with a big producer, Tyson Foods. “The first couple of years we didn’t have any problems,” said Terry, “but then Tyson started asking us to put in extra equipment that we had to pay for.”

Terry had taken out a $500,000 loan to build the chicken houses on his farm, and he wasn’t willing to fork out more money for equipment that he said wasn’t necessary, including extra feed bins and upgrades to the chicken houses.

“If we are independent contractors, then why does the company have the right to tell us what equipment to use?” said Terry. “We were independent in name only when it benefited the company.”

Terry claims Tyson retaliated by giving him sick chicks. In 2005, Tyson didn’t renew Terry’s contract. Finding another big customer was difficult because Tyson was the only chicken company in the area.

Terry sued Tyson in 2008, alleging the company canceled his contract because he rallied farmers in the area to lodge complaints about the company with their congressional representatives and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA); he said Tyson mistreated him with tactics such as weighing his birds incorrectly while not allowing him to watch the weigh-in, a violation of USDA rules.

He lost the case in 2010 after a federal judge declared that the law required him to show that Tyson’s actions had crippled competition for the entire poultry industry, not just him. The court ordered Terry to pay Tyson nearly $30,000 in legal fees. He was forced to declare bankruptcy.

“We lost the farm, our house, our horses and our dogs,” said Terry, who now works as a handyman and carpenter.

Seven years later, a set of federal rules has emerged that aims to strengthen protection for farmers. But the new rules, drawn up in the final days of the Obama administration, are in limbo. The Trump administration suspended the enactment of any new federal rules for two months after inauguration, and just last week, the USDA announced that the new rules would remain on hold for another six months.

The new rules – a culmination of decades of effort by farmers and their advocates – would no longer require farmers to prove harm to competition within the industry owned largely by a handful of producers. The four largest chicken producers in the country, which include Tyson Foods and Pilgrim’s Pride, control more than half of the chicken market and 57% of the turkey market, according to the USDA.

“It’s really a story of unchecked corporate concentration,” said Sally Lee, who works at family farmer advocacy nonprofit Rural Advancement Foundation International-USA and co-director of Under Contract, a documentary about farmers who suffered severe financial losses and emotional toll from what they said was unfair treatment by big chicken producers. “There are a few companies that control the market so they can exercise extreme power over farmers trying to work with them.”

Clawing for control

More than 97% of chicken farmers in the US work under contract with a big producer. A farmer can choose to work independently and sell chickens to a company for processing or directly to retailers and consumers, but these farmers are at an “extreme disadvantage,” said Lee, since most chicken processing plants are owned by producers.

The contract system offers chicken producers a consistent supply of products and guarantees a market for farmers, said Susan Schneider, director of the master’s program in agricultural and food law at the University of Arkansas school of law.

Starting a chicken farm isn’t cheap – one chicken house averages $250,000, and four houses are recommended to achieve a basic level of income. The startup cost sometimes requires farmers to mortgage their farms, Schneider said.

“Any objective legal analysis would find the typical poultry contract to be one-sided by design,” added Schneider.

Farmers also often find there are additional mandates – such as upgrading a chicken house – that weren’t included in the original contract. Investing in those changes could require farmers to take out new loans, and they often feel forced to comply or lose their only customer.

“The relationship between company and contract farmer has changed dramatically over time, to the point that the farmers are treated as employees in many ways, without receiving any of the benefits, yet retaining all the obligations and risk that independent contractors have,” Lee said.

Mike Weaver, a poultry farmer in West Virginia, said his base pay hasn’t changed since he entered the business in 2001.

“As long as they keep us in debt we have to keep raising their chickens. They don’t want farmers to pay off their farms,” Weaver said.

Worth Sparkman, a spokesperson for Tyson Foods, said the contract system is transparent and offers long-term stability to farmers.

“Our average contract farmer has been raising chickens for us for 15 years [and] the compensation we provide is set out clearly in contracts the farmers voluntarily enter into,” said Sparkman. “The farmers are free to discuss the terms of their contracts with whomever they want, including other farmers, and are also free to switch to other chicken processors who operate in their area.”

Unfair advantage?

Producers exert their influence in other ways, too. They supply farmers with baby chicks, feed and medication. A farmer typically has five weeks to raise them, after which the chickens are collected and weighed at a processing plant.

The farmers are paid according to a so-called “tournament system” that pits farmers against each other. The farmer that produces the most amount of meat with the least amount of feed comes out on top. A less efficient farmer will have money deducted from his base pay; that money is then be used to pay the farmers that produced more meat.

The problem, say the farmers, is that winning or losing is beyond their control. For example, they must take the chicks supplied by their producers and are out of luck if they receive a large number of unhealthy chicks.

“They say that if you work harder, you’ll do better, but that’s a lie,” said Weaver. “If you don’t get good chicks and feed from them, there’s no way you can make a good chicken out of it.”

The poultry industry says the tournament system is fair and ensures that the welfare of the chickens comes first.

“The performance-based contract structure of modern poultry production was instinctively designed to put the well-being of the birds as the top priority, as incentives are given to farmers who raise the healthiest birds, take risks and work hard,” said Tom Super, a spokesperson for the National Chicken Council, a trade association. “It incentivizes farmers to do their best, to compete, just like every other business in America or any other free market.”

The new federal rules, opposed by lobbyists for the poultry industry, included criteria for ensuring a fair tournament system.

It’s unclear whether the rules will take effect under the current administration. Republican members of Congress have generally opposed any effort to provide greater contract protections for poultry growers, said Schneider, and she doesn’t see that changing.

“The Republican-controlled Congress has restricted USDA’s efforts in the past, and I assume that this will carry over to the new Republican administration,” said Schneider. “If so, I think that it is very likely that the new rules will be withdrawn, amended, or simply not enforced.”

But Weaver said he and other farmers are optimistic that Trump will act in their best interests, since they helped him get elected.

“He claimed he’s going to stand up for the little guy, that’s why the farmers came out and voted for him and got him into office,” said Weaver. “These multinational corporations have had way too much power over farming for too long.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/16/boston-organic-food-farming-agriculture-startups,"For those seeking mild, year-round temperatures and affordable plots of land, Boston, with its long winters and dense population, isn’t the first city that comes to mind.

But graduates of the city’s nearly 35 colleges and universities are contributing to the area’s growing reputation as a haven for startups challenging and transforming age-old industries, from furniture to political fundraising. The city’s strong entrepreneurial spirit, combined with progressive legislation like the passing of Article 89, has also turned Boston into one of the nation’s hubs for urban agriculture.

The inspiration for Freight Farms, an urban farming business headquartered in South Boston, was launched after co-founders and friends Jon Friedman and Brad McNamara realized that New England currently gets almost 90% of its food from outside the region, yet 10-15% of households still report that they don’t have enough to eat. The over reliance on imported produce drove Friedman and McNamara to launch a Kickstarter campaign in 2011 for their farming business, which sells freight containers to would-be farmers, many of whom aren’t necessarily farmers by trade, but are interested in contributing to sustainable living. A Freight Farms container is designed to be largely self sustained, and uses solar energy to provide the majority of electricity required to grow the crops. Julia Pope, who works in farmer education and support at the organization, says people can find the freight containers squeezed between two buildings, in a parking lot, under an overpass, or virtually anywhere in the modern urban terrain.

Freight Farms has spread north from Boston to Canada, and Pope says there are just over 100 of the company’s container farms operating in the US alone. The company outfits each 40ft container with the equipment for the entire farming cycle, from germination to harvest. This equipment, which the company calls Leafy Green Machine (LGM), creates a hydroponic system, a soil-free growing method that uses recirculated water with higher nutrient levels to help plants grow. Vertical growing towers line the inside of the shipping container, with LED lights optimized for each stage of the growing cycle. Farmers can manage conditions remotely using a smartphone app called Farmhand, which connects to live cameras inside the container.

Pope says that of customers who have purchased the LGM, more than 50 have started small businesses, each consistently producing two acres worth of food year-round. One of these businesses is Corner Stalk Farm, which sells locally grown leafy greens – including kale, mint and arugula, as well as more than varieties of lettuce, to cater to demand at various farmers markets in Boston and Somerville, the city’s landmark Boston Public Market, and through orders from produce delivery services (such as Amazon Fresh) that are increasingly popular in cities. It’s no small feat to own and operate the LGM: purchasing one of the containers will run an aspiring business $85,000, with operating costs adding up to another estimated $13,000 per year.

Luckily, steady consumer demand, evidenced by more than 139 farmers markets across the state of Massachusetts alone, help to offset the high costs to starting and running an urban farm. Hannah Brown, a resident of Boston’s North End, regularly shops at the Boston Public Market, which sells locally sourced goods from more than 30 small businesses. “There aren’t many stores with really fresh produce in the immediate area, so it’s definitely filled a need for me,” she says. Brown also finds the small business owners who sell their produce at the market to be an invaluable resource: “It’s great to be able to talk with the people working the produce stands, because they can recommend what’s freshest and how to prepare it.” As a result, she says she’s taken to only buying produce that’s in season and adjusting her habits to align with what’s available to her locally.

The growing popularity of urban farming owes much to a former mayor, Thomas Menino, and one of his final acts while in office. He signed into law Article 89, expanded zoning laws to permit farming in freight containers, on rooftops, and in larger ground-level farms. Article 89 made it possible for those practitioners to sell their locally grown food within city limits.

One business that has taken advantage of Article 89 is Green City Growers, which runs Fenway Farms, is a 5,000-sq ft rooftop farm above Fenway Park. The rooftop is lined with plants grown in stackable milk crate containers, which are equipped with a weather sensitive drip irrigation system that monitors the moisture of the soil in the crates to make sure plants get just the right amount of water. Although the farm isn’t open to the general public, it is visible to fans from the baseball park, and a stop on the Fenway Park tour.

Boston is far from alone in passing legislation that makes farming a possibility for city-dwellers. In Sacramento, there are even tax incentives for property owners who agree to put their vacant plots of land to active agricultural use for at least five years, while the city council of San Antonio voted just last year to pass legislation that makes urban farming legal throughout city limits. And while Boston boasts home to various agricultural startups and nonprofits, entrepreneurs in other parts of the country are contributing to a national farming movement in their own ways: Kimbal Musk, brother of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, recently set up a container farm in an old Pfizer factory in Brooklyn, while Local Roots Farms is turning shipping containers into urban farms (using the same hydroponic method that the LGM uses) across the Los Angeles area.

As Bostonians now find themselves with a slew of new options to grow and profit from fresh produce on rooftops and in alleyways, some nonprofit organizations are looking to use urban farming as an educational asset. CitySprouts was born in Cambridge in 2001 after executive director Jane Hirschi identified what she calls “an immense need for children to understand where their food was coming from”. CitySprouts teams up with educators to set aside class time for students to cultivate gardens on school property that they can grow their own food in. There are now more than 20 public schools using CitySprouts gardens in the Boston area, and more than 300 public school teachers participating in the fresh food program.

Caitlin O’Donnell, who teaches first grade at Fletcher Maynard Academy in nearby Cambridge, says the program does a great job of giving urban kids the opportunity to interact with their environment in ways they wouldn’t have otherwise, she adds. “Whether students are digging for worms, sketching roots structures, crushing apples for cider, or sampling chives and basil, their hands are busy and their senses are engaged ...what makes City Sprouts most effective (and exceptional) is that it is collaborative and flexible by design.”

Boston’s rise in the national urban farming movement also has helped to make locally grown produce more available to low-income residents. Leah Shafer recalls that she was able to use food stamps at a farmer’s market to receive half-off of her purchases of kale, blueberries, and more.

“It made it possible for me to buy organic, local produce that I otherwise just wouldn’t have been able to afford. I don’t think I would have been able to support local farmers without that discount,” she says.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/13/sustainable-farming-midwest-food-organic-agriculture,"Midwestern states are the second leading producers of crops and livestock behind California. But young farmers are leaving, put off by high land prices and startup costs

On a recent chilly afternoon, Natasha Hegmann, 28, and her husband, Pete Kerns, 27, tended the fire of a giant copper boiler holding some 250 gallons of maple sap. The sap had flowed into the boiler overnight through a series of pipes from nearby trees. Turning the gooey sap into syrup will take days.

A native Iowan, Hegmann worked at a number of local community farms before her and Kerns set up their own, Turkey River Farms, in 2015 to grow vegetables in warmer months and harvest maple sap during the winter. The couple thought about farming in other states but ultimately decided to stay in Iowa because of the support given by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a 32-year-old nonprofit that aims to attract new and young farmers to the field and teach them to grow food organically. The group offers workshops and a program that gives funds to match the money saved by new farmers over a period of time.

Will 2017 be the year we get serious about sustainable food? Read more

“PFI has been huge for us,” Hegmann says. “It’s actually part of the reason that we chose to settle and start our farm in Iowa.”

For decades, the midwest has boasted the highest concentration of farms in the US, and is also a crucial agricultural region, both for local food production and food that is exported. Today, midwestern states, particularly Iowa, are the second leading producers of crops and livestock behind California, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) census. This says a lot about the midwest’s potential for being the next sustainable food production hub in the US.

But here’s the trouble: statistically, young people just aren’t that into farming. In the most recent USDA agricultural census, new farmer numbers dropped by around 20% between 2007-2012, with the majority of farmers falling somewhere between the ages of 55-64, consistent with a 30-year trend. The culprits of this trend: a diminishing ability to subsist on farming income, an increase in debt needed to farm and general rural poverty.

Young people are leaving the midwest faster than anywhere else. “Farming is also not on the typical list of ‘hot’ careers for twenty-somethings, and the barriers to entry can seem daunting,” says Gary Adamkiewicz, assistant professor of Environmental Health and Exposure Disparities at Harvard University.

One of the biggest roadblocks for beginning farmers is land access. Land costs continue to climb and, despite the enormous land transference to come as older farmers retire – 70% of the nation’s farmland over the next two decades – most of it may not end up in the hands of willing young farmers but in the hands of property developers.

For farmers just cutting into the market, starting small, and wanting to grow sustainably, the odds are not great. Large farms have the scale, money and freedom to use synthetic pesticides and fertilizers to maximize yields. Organic farming, on the other hand, can be more profitable but takes more land to grow the same amount of food as conventional farming. Farmers are limited in the types of chemicals they can use to get rid of pests and nurture crops, and organic certification is long and expensive. The USDA requires farmers to demonstrate organic practices for three years before they can be certified – but farmers are not allowed to increase the prices of their products during this time to be on par with other organic produce.

Hannah Breckbill has faced these challenges. The 29-year-old owner of Humble Hands Harvest near Decorah, Iowa, runs a two-woman operation growing organic vegetable produce. “Access to capital is a lot harder with unconventional agriculture, but the capital needs are not a lot less,” she says. Her biggest challenge? Land. “I’ve been able to manage that through creative means, renting and borrowing from landowners who had a few acres to spare. Now I’m finally buying my own land, and that had to happen by creative means too: lots of people in my community gifting me with substantial amounts of money and capital.”

Breckbill says that she’s spent almost $100,000 on Humble Hands Harvest since starting the operation in 2013. Her first year required around $12,000 to run the farm on land she didn’t have to buy at the time. Later, the eight acres she is on now cost $40,000 – some was gifted, some was through a $20,000 loan from her uncle. Electricity cost a further $10,000 and the greenhouse a little over $8,000. Operating costs are roughly around $10,000 per year, not counting labor costs.

Fortunately for Breckbill and other young farmers in the midwest, organizations like PFI help relieve the burden. The Midwest Organic and Sustainable Education Service (Moses) is a nonprofit formed in 1999 that aims to help out farmers in the upper midwest with resources, workshops, and education on all sorts of farming-related subjects, from fieldwork to financial.

The nonprofit’s biggest contribution: an annual educational farming conference, held in Wisconsin. This year’s event, held in February, drew 3,100 attendants hailing from 49 different states and six foreign countries; 44% of them designated themselves as new or beginning farmers (in other words, farming less than ten years) – a rise from the 42% since 2016. Moses designates specific workshops for new farmers as part of its New Organic Stewards program, including education on topics from practical sustainable farming skills to financial tools.

There’s also the Land Stewardship Project (LSP), a Minnesota nonprofit that provides training workshops and courses throughout the state for new farmers, designed to help equip new farmers with business planning skills so they can then run their own profitable agricultural businesses.

According to LSP, farm startup costs tend to average around $60,000 (whether for livestock, a diversified crop of vegetables, or fruits) and may include greenhouses, electricity, coolers for food storage, tractors, equipment, fencing and more. Planting orchards or a mix of vegetables tends to have much higher startup costs, even when on smaller acreage; livestock is relatively lower, even on land close to 50 acres. However, this number does not include the price of land, which varies widely depending on location.

More than 600 farmers completed a beginner’s farming course in the first 16 years of the nonprofit’s initiative, according to LSP. There’s also a two-year mentorship program that pairs new farmers with established and profitable farms in the area. Breckbill happened to benefit from LSP’s programs. “I did my first business planning through LSP, and I continue to work with them,” she says.

Can we feed 10 billion people on organic farming alone? Read more

The beginner’s farming course has even formed its own nationwide collaborative, spawning its own website and splinter programs that model the original program piece-for-piece in South Dakota, North Carolina, Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri.

To address the problem of land, an Iowa organization called Sustainable Iowa Land Trust, or Silt, was established 2014. Modeled closely after other land trusts around the country, the nonprofit protects land purchased or donated to the trust with conservation easements, which are legal agreements that prohibit the land from being developed for business use other than farming.

As a result of placing the land in conservation easement, its value is depreciated – due to it no longer being on the market for development – making it an affordable lease option for new farmers. Silt also helps with organic certification and doesn’t allow farmers to grow high cash conventional crops, such as corn for ethanol – just food. “We set a higher bar in our easements than almost any land trust,” says Suzan Erem, president of Silt.

Erem feels a sense of urgency about carrying out Silt’s mission. “We have a window of opportunity, but if young people don’t keep stepping up to do this labor intensive, somewhat risky form of farming, none of us will have any choices left.”

Adamkiewicz at Harvard agrees. “Last year, the USDA announced a series of initiatives aimed at cultivating the next generation of farmers, including mentoring and loan programs. We need more investments like these.

“We need to train this next generation who are trying to make a difference while dealing with some of the stresses already put on farmland by conventional agriculture.”",guardian.com,False
