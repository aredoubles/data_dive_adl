https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/opinion/after-hate-crimes-victims-stuck-with-the-bill.html,"This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of President Trump. Kanwal Khurana loved living in Cleveland. He and his wife had moved from the suburbs to an apartment in the city in December. “It’s beautiful,” he said. “You can see the whole downtown.” But less than two months later, Mr. Khurana and his wife had just parked their car across the street from the building when they heard someone say, “go back to your own country.” The next morning, they discovered that someone had slashed all four of their tires. Mr. Khurana, 63, is retired from his job writing contracts for Cuyahoga County, and his wife is a homemaker. They help their son pay his tuition at Kent State. They have car insurance, but still had to come up with a $500 co-payment to have their car towed and repaired, plus the fee to rent a car in the meantime. The Khuranas reached out to city and state officials for help paying their bills. They discovered, as many victims of hate and harassment do, that getting financial assistance isn’t always easy. Victims of hate crimes can sue perpetrators under state and federal hate crime or other civil rights laws for compensatory damages and, in some cases, punitive damages as well. But first they need lawyers. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law recently began operating a hotline at 844-9-NO-HATE (844-966-4283), through which volunteers can help callers find legal representation. But beyond that, “there is no real comprehensive network around the country” to connect victims of hate crimes or harassment with lawyers, said Betsy Shuman-Moore, the director of the Hate Crime Project at the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights. In the Chicago area, she added, legal resources for hate crime victims have actually decreased in recent years. When the perpetrator remains unidentified, as in the Khuranas’ case, a lawsuit is usually not an option. Some states, however, have funds set aside to help crime victims pay their expenses. Mr. Khurana wrote to the mayor of Cleveland, whose staff suggested he contact the Ohio attorney general’s office. The office maintains a victims’ compensation fund, but Mr. Khurana was told he was not eligible for compensation because he had not been physically injured. The office sent him a booklet titled “Picking Up the Pieces” with information about crime victims’ rights. Sometimes, friends or family — or strangers — step in to help hate crime victims. After Cristina Alfonso-Zea was attacked last year in the parking lot outside her home in Las Vegas by assailants who hit her in the head, stole her wallet and phone and wrote slurs on her car, her friend set up a GoFundMe campaign to help her. Ms. Alfonso-Zea, a veteran, already had post-traumatic stress disorder, which was exacerbated by the attack. The money from the campaign helped her fix her car and move away from the area where she was attacked. The campaign also helped her psychologically, she said: “It made me realize that there’s really good people out there that really care about you, even if they don’t know you.” She wishes hate crime victims got more information on compensation funds and other resources. “In Las Vegas, they teach us about flash flooding, they teach us abandonment of a rabbit is a felony,” she said, “but at the same time they don’t really teach us about having funds like that or having a safe place that you can go to.” Mrs. Khurana ultimately sold some of her jewelry to pay for their car expenses. The Khuranas don’t plan to move, but they are more careful when they go out in their neighborhood now, and they park their car in a different spot that costs $5 a day. Mr. Khurana is grateful he and his wife weren’t hurt — he thinks of the shooting of two Indian immigrants, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, in Kansas in February. “That night anything could have happened,” he said. “We still feel lucky.” If you have experienced, witnessed or read about a hate crime or incident of bias or harassment, you can use this form to send information about the incident to This Week in Hate and other partners in the Documenting Hate project.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/europe/chechnya-russia-attacks-gays.html,"GROZNY, Russia — It was supposed to be a night out. But for the young man who calls himself Maksim, as for scores of other gay men arrested in a pogrom this month in Russia’s Chechnya region, it pivoted into nearly two weeks of beatings and torture. Maksim said it had started with a chat room conversation with “a very good old friend who is also gay,” and who suggested that they meet at an apartment. When Maksim arrived, however, he was greeted not by his friend but by agents who beat him. Later, they strapped him to a chair, attached electrical wires to his hands with alligator clips and began an interrogation. “They yelled, ‘Who else do you know?’” Maksim said, and zapped him with current from time to time. “It was unbearably painful; I was hanging on with my last strength,” he added. “But I didn’t tell them anything.” Gay men have never had an easy life in Chechnya. But the targeted, collective punishment of gays that began last month under its pro-Kremlin leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, is a new turn in the region’s long history of rights abuses. Novaya Gazeta, an opposition newspaper, first reported the pogrom, saying that at least 100 gay men had been arrested and three killed in the roundup. Human Rights Watch corroborated those findings. The sweep has been widely condemned by Western governments, the United Nations and rights groups. Activists in Russia have set up an underground network to spirit the victims out of Chechnya and to protect them from potentially violent reprisals from their families and others. The victims use assumed names in their everyday dealings. The following account is based on interviews with Maksim, who is in his 20s, and two other gay men who were detained by Chechen security agents. Homosexuality is taboo in Chechnya and the mostly Muslim surrounding areas of the Caucasus region in southern Russia. “This society is highly homophobic,” said Ekaterina L. Sokiryanskaya, Russia project director for the International Crisis Group and an authority on Chechnya. “Homosexuality is condemned. It is believed Islam considers it a great sin.” Nevertheless, before the crackdown, gay men in Chechnya could at least lead social lives, if heavily closeted ones, Maksim said. They met largely in private chat rooms on social networking sites with names like the Village or What the Mountains Are Silent About. “When two gay men meet, they don’t tell one another their true names,” Maksim said. Men met at cafes or at apartments rented for a night, he said. “Nobody suspected my sexual orientation, not even my best friends.” The crackdown began after GayRussia, a rights group based in Moscow, applied for permits for gay pride parades in the Caucasus region, prompting counterprotests by religious groups, the men said. In Chechnya, it became something even worse — a mass “prophylactic” cleansing of homosexuals, the security service agents told the gay men as they rounded them up. The men were held for as little as a day or as long as several weeks, according to Human Rights Watch and to interviews with gay men who later escaped the region. Some “returned to their families barely alive from beatings,” said Tanya Lokshina, Russia program director for Human Rights Watch. Among the fatalities documented by the organization were one man who succumbed during torture and two others who died in “honor killings” by relatives after the police released them. “Human Rights Watch has been getting numerous reports about attacks by security services under Ramzan Kadyrov’s control, and those reports are extremely disturbing,” Ms. Lokshina said. “This is another opportunity to reinforce the culture of fear.” The Chechen authorities’ response to the global outrage over the pogrom has provoked new incredulity. In a telephone interview, Mr. Kadyrov’s spokesman, Alvi Karimov, said the reports of an anti-gay pogrom had to be false because such men did not exist in Chechnya. “In Grozny, have you ever noticed people who, by their appearance or manners, resemble people who are oriented in the wrong way?” Mr. Karimov asked. “A policy is developed for a problem,” he said, referring to a report that said the arrests were official policy. “I can officially say there is no policy because there is no problem. If there were a problem, there would be a policy.” In a televised meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Wednesday, Mr. Kadyrov characterized as “libelous” news reports that the security services in Chechnya had been persecuting gay men. And on Thursday, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told journalists that the Russian authorities had found no evidence that the Chechen police had arrested gay men. But it quickly became clear to Maksim and the other men that the Chechen authorities were applying the same tactics used by Russia and by Mr. Kadyrov to suppress an Islamist insurgency in the region over the past decade. Security service agents took to posing as gay men looking for dates on the Village and in other chat rooms, or persuaded those they had already captured to lure acquaintances, those arrested said in interviews. Fear spread among gay Chechens. “If they caught him, they will get to me,” said a 20-year-old student who identified himself as Ilya and who was interviewed at a safe location outside Chechnya. Ilya fled days before the police showed up at his home, he learned later. The authorities briefly detained another young man, who identified himself as Nohcho, after a friend informed on him during an interrogation. “I don’t blame him,” Nohcho said of the friend. “We are not heroes. We’re just gay guys. They starve you. They shock you.” That, it seems, is essentially what happened to Maksim, who had been corresponding with his gay acquaintance for some time. “One day, he suggested we meet for a drink,” Maksim said. “And because we knew each other a long time, I did not suspect he would be capable of something like this.” When Maksim entered the apartment where they had agreed to meet, security officers roughed him up. Five other men were already in the apartment, lured by the same ruse, he said. His account of the deception used to detain him was consistent with others documented by Human Rights Watch and with the accounts of the two other gay men interviewed separately for this article. All six of the men in the apartment were transferred to a makeshift cell in an abandoned building, where they were tortured with electricity one by one, Maksim said. After 11 days, he was released to a male relative, who was told that Maksim was gay. The security officers told the captives’ male relatives that, if they had any honor, they would kill the young men, Maksim and Ilya said. Maksim’s father threatened to beat him but refrained when his son showed him the bruises he already had. Instead his father said, “I should kill you.” Fearing for his life, Maksim turned to a gay rights group, the Russian LGBT Network, based in St. Petersburg, which has established an emergency, round-the-clock volunteer group to help gay men escape the region. To reassure the victims they are trying to help, the activists have taken extraordinary precautions, operating virtually as a partisan cell behind enemy lines, though they have done nothing illegal under Russian law. “These people don’t trust anybody,” said Olga Baranova, director of the Moscow Community Center, a support group for gays that is part of the volunteer network helping gay men flee Chechnya. After arriving at the safe location outside Chechnya, several young men said they had suspected that the volunteer group was also a trap but had no other option but to accept the help, Ms. Baranova said. “They say, ‘We didn’t believe you were real,’” she said. “‘We thought this was the last effort to round up whoever was left.’” The network bought airplane tickets for Chechen gay men, found safe houses and arranged for doctors to treat those who had been badly beaten. “Gays in Chechnya and the North Caucasus are in lethal danger,” Igor Kochetkov, director of the Russian LGBT Network, said in a telephone interview. “People whose partners are detained have every reason to believe they will be arrested. It is very hard not to name the names under torture.” ",New York Times,1
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/opinion/when-hate-leads-to-depression.html,"This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of President Trump. Women afraid to go out in public. College students struggling in school. Employees feeling unsafe on the job. People of all walks of life experiencing anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. These are some of the mental and emotional effects of what advocates say is a wave of hate crimes and racist harassment that started during President Trump’s campaign. Muslims, immigrants and members of other groups targeted with violence and intimidation are seeking help to deal with lingering trauma. But mental health groups and advocates are finding that the specialized support they need doesn’t always exist. The Family and Youth Institute, which studies the mental health needs of American Muslims, has seen more reports of anxiety and depression since the campaign began, as well as more people seeking therapy and asking questions about mental health. It’s not only victims of hate crimes who are affected, according to Dr. Sameera Ahmed, the director of the institute — anti-Muslim harassment and political rhetoric are having a psychological impact on many American Muslims, regardless of whether they have been personally targeted. Muslims in America have been in “perpetual crisis mode” in recent years, dealing with the aftermath of the 2015 Paris attacks, followed by President Trump’s campaign, election, inauguration and travel ban, said Dr. Rania Awaad, the director of the Muslims and Mental Health Lab at Stanford University and the clinical director of the San Francisco Bay Area branch of the Khalil Center, a Muslim counseling center. In November, the center offered a support group for young people, some of whom had been harassed at school, but their parents wouldn’t leave — they wanted help too. Eventually, “they went to a corner of the conference room and created their own little support group,” Dr. Awaad said. Not everyone can find support in the wake of a hate crime. Dr. Prabhjot Singh, now the chair of the department of health system design and global health at the Mount Sinai Health System, felt angry and depressed after he was attacked in New York in 2005, when he was in graduate school. He reached out to mental health services at his university, but they weren’t much help, since they were geared toward people with severe psychiatric illness. When he was attacked again a few years later, his anger, depression and sense of isolation deepened. He dealt with them by throwing himself into work. He also began practicing his Sikh religion more actively, growing his beard and waking up before dawn to meditate. Then, in 2013, he was attacked by a group of young men who called him “Osama” and “terrorist” and punched him in the face, breaking his jaw. That attack got significant media attention, and people began to email him asking for advice after they or their loved ones experienced hate crimes. The volume of recent messages has been a sign for him that hate crimes are on the rise. “I just hear it in my inbox,” he said. Sometimes Dr. Singh can help the people who write to him, and sometimes he can’t. He sees a lack of resources for people who have been victims of hate crimes: “I don’t think there’s really a good way for people who have had this type of experience to find useful community.” Some nonprofit groups are mobilizing to offer mental health services for people affected by hate crimes or harassment, who may have unique needs that conventional therapy doesn’t always address. Staff at the YWCA of Kalamazoo in western Michigan found that while people who had experienced hate crimes could find individual counseling in the area, which is home to many immigrants working in the agriculture industry, there were no services for people feeling the indirect effects of hate crimes against people of their race or religion, said Jessica Glynn, the director of law and policy at the YWCA. To fill the gap, the YWCA of Kalamazoo earlier this year created a support group for survivors, witnesses and others affected by hate crimes, and plans to create more groups in the area if needed. Established a year and a half ago, the Bay Area Khalil Center has already expanded to include a second branch, and a third is in the works. In addition to support groups, the center offers individual therapy with Muslim therapists. Working with a therapist who shares their religion means patients “don’t have to start from scratch explaining things,” said Dr. Awaad. The Maryland chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations holds free self-defense workshops and recently conducted its first training on how to respond to an active shooter. Learning preparedness skills can help people cope with anxiety and fear, said Dr. Zainab Chaudry, the council’s Maryland outreach manager. “We can’t control external factors in our environment,” she added, “but we can control how we respond.” Since the attack in 2013, Dr. Singh has discovered that little research or advice exists to help doctors identify and treat patients who have experienced hate crimes. He’s begun work on a guide, perhaps drawing on techniques developed to treat survivors of domestic and sexual violence. Dr. Singh saw the election of President Trump as the latest symptom of a deep national confusion that he’s not sure how to address. But he takes comfort in his Sikh practice: “finding that stillness, finding that discipline to remember that we know each other far more than we say we do. We are all connected.” If you have experienced, witnessed or read about a hate crime or incident of bias or harassment, you can use this form to send information about the incident to This Week in Hate and other partners in the Documenting Hate project.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/world/europe/un-chechnya-gay-men-killing-abuse.html,"LONDON — United Nations experts demanded on Thursday that Chechnya halt the abduction, detention, beating and killing of gay and bisexual men, after weeks of reports about violent repression there. “These are acts of persecution and violence on an unprecedented scale in the region and constitute serious violations of the obligations of the Russian Federation under international human rights law,” the experts, a panel of five that advises the United Nations Human Rights Council, said in a statement. The experts noted that much of the abuse was reported to have taken place at an unofficial detention center near Argun, a town about 10 miles east of Grozny, the Chechen capital. “The arrested men are subjected to physical and verbal abuse, torture including with electric shocks, beatings, insults and humiliations,” the experts wrote. “They are forced to give contact details of other gay people and threatened with having their sexual orientation disclosed to their family and community — a move which could put them at risk of ‘honor killings.’” Since last month, reports have circulated within Russia that local militias and security forces have been hunting down, detaining and abusing men they perceived to be gay or bisexual. On April 1, a leading opposition newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, confirmed those reports, citing Russian federal law enforcement officials, who blamed the local authorities. Dozens of men are said to have been rounded up, but precise numbers — including a death toll — are not available. Since 2007, Chechnya — a mountainous republic within the Russian Federation and the site of a long-running insurgency that Russia eventually crushed — has been led by a strongman, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, who has been granted significant leeway in exchange for his allegiance to the Kremlin. In restive Muslim regions in southern Russia, Mr. Putin has empowered local leaders to enforce their interpretation of traditional Muslim values, partly in an effort to co-opt Islamist extremism, which has largely been driven underground. A spokesman for Mr. Kadyrov issued a chilling denial on April 1, after the initial reports surfaced. “You cannot arrest or repress people who just don’t exist in the republic,” the spokesman, Alvi Karimov, told the Interfax news agency. “If such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return.” The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on April 3 that he could not confirm the newspaper’s account but added: “This is something for law enforcement to deal with. This is not on the Kremlin’s agenda.” According to Novaya Gazeta, the persecution intensified after a group based in Moscow, GayRussia.ru, applied for permits to stage gay-pride parades in four cities in the North Caucasus region. The group did not apply for a permit in Chechnya, but it did in another Muslim area in the region, Kabardino-Balkaria. The mere application there — denied, as usual — prompted an anti-gay counterdemonstration. “In Chechnya, the command was given for a ‘prophylactic sweep,’ and it went as far as real murders,” Novaya Gazeta reported. As part of the sweep, investigators posed as men looking for dates or sex. Gay men have begun deleting online accounts or even fleeing the region, the newspaper reported. The United Nations experts urged the authorities to end the persecution, saying that Chechens were “living in a climate of fear fueled by homophobic speeches by local authorities.” They also demanded that the authorities immediately release all detainees, thoroughly investigate the anti-gay campaign and hold the persecutors accountable. The experts condemned statements by Chechen officials suggesting that gay people should be hunted down and killed. “The Russian Federation must officially state that it does not tolerate any form of incitement to violence, social stigmatization of homosexuality or hate speech, and does not condone discrimination or violence against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity,” their statement said. There was little suggestion that Moscow would give the experts’ warnings much heed. Russia has been widely criticized for cracking down on the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. In 2013, a law criminalized giving minors materials promoting “nontraditional” sexual relationships — a statute that has been used to justify the arrests of gay rights activists. The experts are Vitit Muntarbhorn of Thailand, who focuses on sexual orientation and gender identity; Sètondji Roland Adjovi of Benin, an expert on arbitrary detention; Agnès Callamard of France, an authority on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Nils Melzer of Switzerland, who focuses on torture and other cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment or punishment; and David Kaye of the United States, a specialist in freedom of opinion and expression.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/europe/dutch-men-hold-hands.html,"From Amsterdam to New York, London to Havana, Dutch men across the world held hands this week to show solidarity with a gay couple who say they were brutally beaten in Arnhem, the Netherlands. The outpouring of support came after the married couple, Jasper Vernes-Sewratan and Ronnie Sewratan-Vernes, said they were attacked by a gang of youths while holding hands on their way home from a party early Sunday. According to a statement the Arnhem police posted on Facebook, the two said they had been attacked by men wielding bolt cutters; one had some of his teeth smashed out. Prosecutors said five teenage suspects would be charged on Thursday with serious bodily harm. The authorities are still investigating the motivation for the attack, which the victims have characterized as a hate crime. The beating caused particular outrage in the Netherlands, which has long prided itself on its tolerance. Amsterdam, the capital, has been a haven for sexual minorities for centuries, and it has marketed itself as the “gay capital of Europe.” Homosexuality was removed from the Dutch criminal code in 1811, and the Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize gay marriage, with the first ceremonies in 2001. Gay rights are supported across the political spectrum in the Netherlands. The attack comes as the country has been grappling with growing anti-immigrant sentiment, fueled in part by the far-right leader Geert Wilders, who has railed against immigrants and Muslims in particular, saying that “Islamization” is a threat to European liberal values, including gay rights and women’s rights. The populist party of Mr. Wilders, who likens himself to Donald J. Trump, came second in recent Dutch elections. He is an ideological heir of Pim Fortuyn, a right-wing politician who derided Islam, immigration and multiculturalism, and who was openly gay. Mr. Fortuyn was killed in 2002, days before his party placed second in national elections. The Dutch news media quoted Gerald Roethof, a lawyer for one of the suspects, as saying that the couple had instigated the fight by acting aggressively toward the teenagers, an accusation the two vehemently denied. Mr. Roethof also denied that bolt cutters had been used, or that the men were targeted because they were gay. But he said his client had acknowledged punching one of the men in the mouth. Mr. Sewratan-Vernes, 31, told  the Dutch public broadcaster NOS that he and his husband seldom held hands in public for fear of provoking an attack. “But we’d had a nice evening, it was late, and we thought we were alone,” he said. Then suddenly six to eight youths set upon them, he said, and “before I knew it, I was on the ground fighting with three men on top of me.” After the attack, which Mr. Vernes-Sewratan, 35, recounted on his Facebook page, Dutch politicians, actors, police officers, soldiers and athletes took to the streets, holding hands. Hundreds of people marched through the streets of Amsterdam to show their support for gay rights. The expressions of support grew after the journalist Barbara Berend appealed on Twitter for men, whether straight or gay, to walk hand in hand. Dozens heeded her call and posted photographs of themselves doing just that, often with the hashtag #allemannenhandinhand (all men holding hands). Two high-profile politicians — Alexander Pechtold, leader of the liberal-democratic party D66, and Wouter Koolmees, a lawmaker in the party — showed up for coalition talks on Monday holding hands. COC Netherlands, an advocacy group for gay rights based in Amsterdam, said the number of reported cases of violence against gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people had increased to 1,600 in 2015 from about 400 in 2009. Of the 1,600, nine resulted in convictions for discrimination-related offenses, including hate crimes. It cautioned, however, that the increase in reporting could also be a result of greater awareness of the issue. ",New York Times,1
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/02/nyregion/a-day-out-leaves-two-transgender-women-living-in-fear.html,"Nayra and Gabriela don’t go out much these days, and not just because the two roommates are homebodies. When they venture outside their apartment in Queens, their hesitation is caused as much by emotional wounds as by physical injuries. The two friends are trans women, and though their Jackson Heights neighborhood has a reputation as a welcoming community for gays and lesbians, hate crimes against transgender women have alarmed many in the area. On the afternoon of March 17, the two women were entering a McDonald’s restaurant on Roosevelt Avenue when they heard a man screaming behind them. When they turned around, they said, he began hurling insults. “He called us prostitutes, faggots, bitches,” said Gabriela, 33, who, like her friend, spoke on the condition that her last name not be published because of the nature of the assault as well as lingering fear. “I looked at him and said, ‘Girl, this man is crazy.’ He wanted to hurt us.” Within seconds, the encounter escalated from insults to injuries. The man rushed them, knocking them to the ground as he pummeled Nayra, whose ankle was fractured in the fall. Gabriella said that she had pounced on him but that he had gotten up, grabbed a broken umbrella and used it to beat her on her face and hands. When he tried to escape, Gabriella chased him, grabbing at the waistband of his pants and slowing him down until the police arrived and took him into custody. No bystanders intervened during the attack, they said. Now, what has been called a hate crime by the police has turned a neighborhood they love into one they fear. “I can’t go out and see too many people,” Nayra, 31, said. “If I have appointments, I’ll take a taxi and come back home. I don’t want to see anybody. If I do, I freeze. If I go outside to smoke and I hear a man’s voice, I panic.” Patrick Omeara, 38, of Oakdale, N.Y., was arrested and faces various charges, including assault as a hate crime. He could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Howard Turman, did not respond to several voice messages requesting comment. The case is in the pretrial stage, and the next court date is scheduled for Tuesday. Jackson Heights has come a long way since skinheads lured Julio Rivera, a gay man, into a schoolyard and killed him. That 1990 attack galvanized activists and residents, and led to the establishment of the borough’s gay pride parade and a political club that has promoted laws and policies helping gay, lesbian and transgender people. Yet the attacks on trans women — three this year and 16 in 2016, according to local advocates — are an unsettling reminder of the work still to be done. “People have this idea that New York City is free of violence and progressive,” said Shelby Chestnut, director of community organizing and public advocacy at the New York City Anti-Violence Project. “But violence is still occurring against many marginalized communities, and the trans community is deeply affected by that. “We need to push the public to pay attention to trans issues and see it as a civil rights issue,” she continued. “We are in this moment in society where violence and hatred is emerging in a number of communities, and it exists in New York.” Nationally, Ms. Chestnut said, transgender women are being killed in greater numbers than any other segment of the L.G.B.T. community. This year alone, she said, there have been seven such murders: Six victims were African-American, and one was Native American. Advocates said these instances of violence were not isolated but the result of a combination of factors that leave African-American and Latina trans women vulnerable. Harassed in public, rejected by their families and uneasy in school or homeless shelters for men, they are left to fend for themselves and are at a higher risk of becoming victims of violence, advocates said. And the political debate over unauthorized immigrants has left many fearful of speaking out. “The biggest challenge in working with transgender people is they often don’t have the self-esteem to think they are worth seeking support or help for themselves,” said City Councilman Daniel Dromm, who represents Jackson Heights. “There is also distrust in going to the authorities, especially the police,” he said. “In the past they have gone there and faced harassment, even at night when they were coming home from the bars. That distrust causes hesitation.” Nayra and Gabriela encountered some of this after the attack. Although the police who responded were helpful, they said, the detectives who followed up with them at the hospital made them uncomfortable by asking the same questions repeatedly, as if they did not believe them. Nor did the detectives speak Spanish, even though the women, who are Puerto Rican, have limited English proficiency. Since that encounter in the hospital, the women said, they have yet to hear back from the police. “We need more laws to ensure the security of trans women,” said Bianey Garcia, a transgender organizer with Make the Road New York. “We don’t need more police. We want the police who are already there to pay more attention to these cases.” Until then, Gabriela and Nayra are paying extra attention. “We never had anything happen to us before,” Gabriela said. “Now I walk with fear, like any woman. But now I pay more attention to what I hear around me. I notice more. I look at every little thing. If a couple of people pass by too close to me on the street, I keep walking, wait a little and then look back at them quickly to see if anyone is following me.” ",New York Times,1
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/opinion/when-your-commute-includes-hearing-you-dont-belong-in-this-country.html,"This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of President Trump. Rajpreet Heir was taking the L train to a friend’s birthday party in Manhattan this month when a white man began shouting at her. “Do you even know what a Marine looks like?” the man asked Ms. Heir, who is pictured in the video above. “Do you know what they have to see? What they do for this country? Because of people like you.” He told Ms. Heir, who is Sikh and was born in Indiana, that he hoped she was sent “back to Lebanon” and said, “You don’t belong in this country.” As New York City works to respond to a rise in reports of discrimination and harassment, subways have emerged as a source of special concern. Harassment has long been a problem on subways, in part because many strangers are packed together on narrow cars, sometimes for long periods. “Even in a park, you’re not going to be quite that close together,” said Emily May, the executive director of the anti-harassment group Hollaback. But since the election, the group has received nearly double the usual number of reports of harassment on the subway, and more than usual involve racist, Islamophobic or anti-immigrant comments. The New York City Commission on Human Rights was concerned enough about postelection incidents on subways that it organized an outreach day in December, with handouts on religious discrimination and reporting harassment distributed at eight subway stations. Overall, the commission saw a 480 percent increase in claims of discriminatory harassment between 2015 and 2016. For Sarah Dodds-Brown, the shock of being singled out for a racist attack was compounded by the fact that no one stepped in to help her. She was riding the train to work one morning in mid-January when a man began elbowing her in the back. When Ms. Dodds-Brown, who is black, asked him to stop, he said, “Obama’s term is over.” Then the man, who was Asian-American, delivered an angry rant that included a comment about “self-righteous slaves.” “I wouldn’t have expected somebody to confront him, necessarily,” she said. But even someone making eye contact with the man, she said, would have sent the message that his behavior was unacceptable. Harassment can be more traumatic when no one steps in to help, Ms. May said, and people who have experienced it are more likely to wish a bystander had spoken up than that police had gotten involved. Two fellow passengers stepped in to help Ms. Heir after the incident on the L train. One woman tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she was all right. “That meant something,” Ms. Heir said, “because when you’re a minority, you’re so used to just experiencing things on your own.” Another woman reported the incident to a police officer at a subway station. Anyone who witnesses or experiences harassment on the subway can report it to the city’s human rights commission by calling (718) 722-3131. Communities Against Hate, a partnership of 11 civil rights organizations, operates a hotline at 844-9-NO-HATE (844-966-4283), where people who have been harassed can get information about resources like legal services and counseling. Hollaback and other organizations offer bystander intervention training to help people learn what to do if they see someone being harassed. Ms. Dodds-Brown reported what happened to her on the subway to the Documenting Hate project, a group of organizations — including The New York Times opinion section — tracking hate crimes and harassment since the election. She also posted about the incident on Facebook and talked to her children and their teachers about it. She wanted people to understand how to protect themselves and others, she said. “We actually all have a responsibility to create the society we want.” If you have experienced, witnessed or read about a hate crime or incident of bias or harassment, you can use this form to send information about the incident to This Week in Hate and other partners in the Documenting Hate project. The form is not a report to law enforcement or any government agency. These resources may be helpful for people who have experienced harassment.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/opinion/timothy-caughman-the-other-terror-victim.html,"His name was Timothy Caughman. He was from Manhattan and was 66 when he died. The police say he was stabbed on Monday night by a 28-year-old man who had come to New York City from Baltimore looking to kill black men. It was Mr. Caughman’s misfortune to be male and black when the stranger with a 26-inch sword approached on Ninth Avenue near 36th Street, around the corner from where he lived. We don’t know much else about Mr. Caughman, but the persona he shared with the world on Twitter was that of a man of buoyant outlook and varied interests, who was amused by many things, fond of music and movies, captivated by celebrities. His profile says he was a “can and bottle recycler” and collector of autographs. “I would love to visit California,” it says. A selfie shows him waiting in line to vote and declaring his love for America. His Twitter feed is generous with condolences for celebrities: for Chuck Berry, Joni Sledge, Al Jarreau. On St. Patrick’s Day he retweeted a photograph of the athletes of Team Ireland competing in the Special Olympics World Winter Games in Austria. Mr. Caughman’s death was, by the police account, a murderous act of terror in the heart of America’s biggest city, at a time of white-hot fear of radical violence. On Thursday, President Trump sent prayers and condolences via Twitter to the family and friends of Kurt Cochran, an American killed in a terrorist rampage in London. He called Mr. Cochran “a great American.” He did not tweet about his fellow New Yorker, Mr. Caughman. Mr. Trump is easily provoked to outrage. But he seems unable to summon that emotion on behalf of Mr. Caughman, who was poor and black and lived in a shelter for homeless people with H.I.V. and AIDS. Maybe he’s not that kind of president. So the next best thing is to turn to his predecessor Barack Obama, who confronted senseless violence with healing words again and again. In January he said this, to a Chicago TV news station: “We don’t benefit from pretending that racism doesn’t exist and hate doesn’t exist. We don’t benefit from not talking about it. The fact that these things are being surfaced means we can solve them. But over all, what I’ve seen as president in traveling around the country is, particularly, the next generation, young people, their appreciation of people who are different than them, come from different places, have different backgrounds, my daughter’s generation, they’re far more sophisticated about race, far more tolerant and embracing of diversity. So I think that over the long arc, America will keep on getting better.” Yet suspicion and hatred are stoked daily; intolerance is federal policy; white nationalists serve in the White House. Mr. Obama is right to believe in a tolerant America — but with crimes like these, keeping faith in that vision can be difficult over the long arc that seems to get longer every day.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/nyregion/james-harris-jackson-timothy-caughman-murder.html,"Draped in the clouds of his white spacesuit, James Harris Jackson, 28, trim light hair above a shaved, doughy face, was led in handcuffs out of a police station house in Midtown Manhattan on Thursday morning, then driven downtown for his arraignment. Prosecutors say Mr. Jackson traveled to New York from Baltimore with a single intention, that of killing black men — no one in particular, just blacks in general — and that he plunged an 18-inch blade into Timothy Caughman, 66, late on Monday evening. In December 2014, a little more than two years ago, another person crazed over color came to New York, also from Baltimore, and made his way to Brooklyn. That man, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, walked up to the passenger-side window of a police car parked in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and emptied a silver semiautomatic handgun, killing officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. A few minutes later, Mr. Brinsley turned his gun on himself as he was chased into a subway station. His fixation was neither black, white nor any other hues of human skin; it was blue. Same motive, different weaponry. Mr. Jackson, the authorities say, is a white supremacist obsessed with black men mixing with white women; Mr. Brinsley proclaimed himself an avenger of black lives cut down by police officers, and on social media declared his intention to kill some. The lawyer for Mr. Jackson has made the sensible point that the facts need to be established, and that if they were indeed as claimed, then mental health issues would have to be addressed. What followed the murder of the two police officers in 2014 bore no resemblance to such a measured response. With Mr. Brinsley’s suicide, public figures quickly looked for people to blame. The head of the police union said Mayor Bill de Blasio had “blood on his hands.” A former governor of New York also blamed the mayor, and added the United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. A former mayor blamed President Obama, even though the president had condemned the murders, called on the public to support the police, and solicited prayers for the officers’ families. Now comes the matter of a purported white supremacist who, prosecutors say, not only used a sword to slaughter an innocent man, but had plans to kill more in Times Square. The usual suspects on matters of terrorism have not been rushing to condemn this week’s murder of Mr. Caughman. President Trump has not yet said anything about this horrific crime. Figuring out which politicians are more virtuous based on the speed of their denunciations of heinous acts is a fool’s game; nothing is repaired by pious news releases or rants on cable television and social media. Still, the sharp sensitivity of the president to any crime charged to an immigrant is striking when compared with his seeming indifference to attacks on minorities, or his own verbal forays. He was notably slow off the mark when an Indian engineer was killed in Kansas by a man who questioned his immigration status. After David Duke, the former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, supported his candidacy, Mr. Trump said he did not know who Mr. Duke was, despite a long, unambiguous public record to the contrary. During the campaign, Mr. Trump re-tweeted false statistics from a white supremacist about black-on-white crime. He said Mexico was sending rapists and criminals to the United States, although studies show that immigrants, both with and without permission to be in the country, are more law-abiding than those born here. For the better part of five years, Mr. Trump claimed that President Obama was not born in America and that his investigators had evidence of it. He had none. It is beyond conception that any elected official in the United States, from Mr. Trump down, could choose to appear indifferent to race-based attacks. Much remains to be learned about the man accused of this week’s crime; the authorities say his race hatred goes back a decade. Surveillance video appears to show Mr. Caughman’s attacker scampering along a street in Midtown moments after the stabbing. However deep the roots of that violence, it is impossible to look at those images and not recall the proverbial warning, that they who sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind. ",New York Times,1
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/jcc-bomb-threats.html,"JERUSALEM — A monthslong wave of bomb threats against Jewish institutions in the United States that prompted evacuations, heightened security and fears of rising anti-Semitism gave way to an unexpected twist on Thursday. The person responsible for many of the threats, law enforcement officials said, was half a world away, in Israel, a Jewish teenager. An intensive investigation spanning multiple countries culminated on Thursday in the arrest of the 18-year-old suspect, who holds dual Israeli and American citizenship, and his father. The teenager’s lawyer said he had a brain tumor that could affect his behavior. The surge in threats over the past few months — well over 100 sent to Jewish community centers, schools and museums since the start of the year — coincided with an increase in hate crimes against a number of groups, from scrawled swastikas to homicides, feeding worries about a new era of bigotry. American and Israeli officials refused to say how many of those threats the suspect was accused of making. And some recent anti-Semitic acts were apparently committed by others, like threats against Jewish centers for which a Missouri man was charged, and the vandalizing of Jewish cemeteries. But officials made it clear that they considered the teenager, who lived in the Ashkelon area of southern Israel, to be the primary source of the threats, though they did not offer a motive. “This is the guy we are talking about,” an Israeli police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, said. The suspect made threats to sites in Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the United States, and to at least one commercial airline flight, prompting an emergency landing, Mr. Rosenfeld said. A judge ordered the suspect, who has not been charged, held until at least March 30 and ordered a medical examination. His father was ordered held for eight days, on suspicion that he might have been aware of the threats, or even been involved. The father denies any knowledge of the threats, his lawyer said. The judge imposed an order of silence forbidding the Israeli authorities to release either man’s name. The teenager, who was born in Israel, has a brain tumor that can affect his cognitive abilities and lead to “irrational” behavior, his lawyer, Galit Bash, said. She would not say whether her client, who she said did not have a criminal record, had admitted or denied involvement. Ms. Bash and the father’s lawyer, Eran Rau, who are both from the Office of the Israeli Public Defender, said the young man was an only child who lived with his parents and had been home-schooled, which is unusual in Israel. While most Israelis are drafted into military service, the teenager was rejected, which Ms. Bash said was because of his medical condition. Israeli news media reported that she had said in court that he had the tumor since he was 14. The father, an engineer in his early 50s, was cooperating with investigators, Mr. Rau said. He said his client, who also has no criminal record, was concerned primarily with his son’s welfare, given his medical condition. “This all seems very strange and preliminary to me,” Mr. Rau said. Israeli news outlets reported that when the teenager was arrested, he tried to grab an officer’s gun. In his brief court appearance, the suspect, wearing khaki cargo pants, bowed his head and pulled up his shirt to conceal his face. On Thursday morning, after months of investigation and waves of turmoil and panic, the Federal Bureau of Investigation held a conference call with leaders of Jewish organizations to discuss the surprising denouement to the investigation. As the news spread, it drew mixed reactions from Jewish leaders and anti-discrimination groups who tried to make sense of it. Joel Dinkin, the executive vice president of the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center of Houston, said that it was “a little bit perplexing from the standpoint of the fact that it’s somebody Jewish.” Jonathan A. Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, cautioned that many of the people responsible for anti-Semitic threats, vandalism and “a torrent of abuse online” remained at large. And even the threats attributed to the Israeli teenager, he said, should still be considered acts of anti-Semitism. “The motive may have been unclear, but the impact was crystal clear,” Mr. Greenblatt said. “These were acts that terrorized a community just because of their faith.” Critics of President Trump have accused him of playing down hatred and violence against minority groups and charged that his anti-immigrant remarks are fueling conflict. He did not publicly condemn the anti-Semitic threats and vandalism until Feb. 21, weeks after Jewish groups began calling on him to speak out. On Feb. 28, in a meeting with state attorneys general, Mr. Trump suggested that some of the threats and vandalism could be a politically motivated effort to “make people look bad,” rather than actual expressions of bias, according to people who took part in the meeting. Despite the arrest, “we hope our elected officials will directly confront the wave of hate violence that we’ve seen since the election,” said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Project. The authorities said the person who made the calls had sent them through the internet and used sophisticated software to disguise his location and camouflage his voice, which slowed the investigation. When the Israeli police searched the suspect’s house, investigators confiscated computers, an antenna and other equipment. An American official said it appeared that the man had used Tor, widely available anonymity software that masks a computer’s true whereabouts by routing its internet traffic through various points around the globe. Many people use Tor, which is managed by a nonprofit digital privacy group, including those conducting illicit business and activists trying to avoid government censorship or surveillance. “The investigation began in several countries at the same time, in which dozens of threatening calls were received at public places, events, synagogues and community buildings that caused panic and disrupted events and activities in various organizations,” the Israeli police said in a statement. The F.B.I. worked closely with the Israeli authorities on the investigation, starting in September — months before American organizations began to note a surge in threats to American targets, according to Cary Gleicher, the bureau’s top agent in Israel. Some of the earliest American targets of bomb threats were schools, centers and museums in Alaska, Florida and New York that were affiliated with Chabad-Lubavitch, an Orthodox Jewish movement, according to a Chabad official. The movement did not publicize the threats, which received little or no news coverage. Mr. Gleicher said he had met in early March in Washington with James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, who asked about efforts to find the person making the threatening calls, and made it clear that he had “great interest in getting this thing done.” In mid-March, Mr. Comey met with Jewish leaders at bureau headquarters to brief them on the investigation. “I left with a level of confidence that they were definitively making strides,” said Jerry B. Silverman, the chief executive of the Jewish Federations of North America. “It was clear that they were moving at a very rapid pace.” The American-Israeli cooperation intensified last week, when the F.B.I. sent 14 people — both agents and technical experts — to Israel to assist in the investigation, Mr. Gleicher said in an interview from Israel. “This was a big deal,” he said, adding that it had taken the resources of both countries to get “across the finish line.” “Monday was the eureka moment,” he said, when investigators figured out who was making the calls. In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who described the threats as “hate crimes,” said, “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate the targeting of any community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs.” ",New York Times,1

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/choate-life-trustees-resign-sex-abuse.html,"Two former headmasters who were life trustees at Choate Rosemary Hall stepped down this week, forced aside by allegations that teachers at the school had sexually abused students for decades and that administrators had not responded appropriately. The two trustees were Charles Dey, who served as headmaster at the elite Connecticut boarding school from 1973 to 1991, and Edward Shanahan, who held that position from 1991 to 2011. Choate released a report this month from investigators at the law firm Covington & Burling that named 12 former faculty members who it said had abused students in cases dating back to the 1960s. One teacher was said to have raped a student while on a school trip in Costa Rica. Another used a girl’s disciplinary issues to pressure her to have sex with him repeatedly, the report said. For many years, administrators at the school largely responded to reports of misconduct by trying to keep them quiet. In some cases, administrators decided that accused faculty members could remain at Choate. Other teachers were forced out, but none of the episodes were reported to the authorities until 2010, even though Connecticut educators have been legally required to report suspected abuse since 1967. Because the accusations were never reported, teachers suspected of misconduct were able to move on to work at other schools. Much of the abuse documented by investigators occurred while Mr. Dey and Mr. Shanahan were in charge, and many alumni have called for their removal from their positions. Mr. Dey resigned on Thursday and Mr. Shanahan resigned on Friday. In a statement, Lorraine S. Connelly, a Choate spokeswoman, thanked Mr. Shanahan and Mr. Dey “for their contributions to the school” and said, “we believe their resignations are important steps in our community’s healing process.” The news of their resignations was first reported by The Record-Journal in Connecticut. The report released by Choate, which documented misconduct claims in detail, marked a sharp departure from the way the school had handled such issues in the past. Reached by phone, Mr. Dey said he was ""proud of the school, in terms of what they have done and the way they have approached it.” In a lengthy statement, his first since the Choate report was released, Mr. Shanahan said Friday that he was “heartbroken” to read about what some students had experienced at the school while he was its headmaster. “The burden I personally carry is that children were harmed by faculty during my tenure, for which I am deeply, deeply sorry, and the only consolation I have is that, as a result of this report, future incidents like these will be far less likely to occur, and survivors will feel more enabled to come forward for the support they deserve,” Mr. Shanahan said. “Thank you for the privilege of serving you for 20 years. Would that I had done it better.” ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/senator-menendez-corruption-case.html,"A Florida eye doctor was convicted on Friday of running a vast scheme to defraud Medicare of more than $90 million in a case that could have significant ramifications for Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey. The doctor, Salomon E. Melgen, a prominent ophthalmologist, has been the longtime political benefactor of Mr. Menendez, a Democrat. Both face federal corruption charges in an unrelated case scheduled to go on trial in September in Newark. The senator is accused of trading political favors for free trips on the doctor’s private jet, lavish vacations to his resort home in the Dominican Republic and a stay at a five-star hotel in Paris. A jury in Palm Beach County, Fla., found Dr. Melgen guilty on all 67 counts of Medicare fraud, and according to prosecutors in the case, he could spend at least 15 years in prison. The conviction and the sentence he now faces could increase pressure on Dr. Melgen to cooperate with the authorities in the case against Mr. Menendez, his co-defendant in their pending trial. After he is sentenced in the Florida case in July, Dr. Melgen, if he should choose to cooperate, could seek to have that sentence reduced. A provision of federal law allows a judge, upon a motion by the government, to reduce a defendant’s sentence if the defendant is found to have provided “substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.” A lawyer for Dr. Melgen in the Florida trial, Kirk Ogrosky, said the doctor views the two cases as completely separate. “It will have no impact on what will happen in New Jersey,” Mr. Ogrosky said in a phone interview. “He intends to go to trial in New Jersey in September, and nothing about the Florida case changes that.” A lawyer for Mr. Menendez said that the senator was “saddened for his longtime friend” but that the conviction in Florida would have “no bearing” on the bribery charges against his client. “This verdict will have no impact on him,” the lawyer, Abbe David Lowell, said in a statement. “Dr. Melgen’s case focused solely on the day-to-day operations of his medical practice and the private care of his patients — specifics of which the senator could not be aware, nor has it ever been suggested otherwise.” Mr. Menendez and Dr. Melgen have pleaded not guilty to the bribery charges, and Mr. Menendez has spent two years aggressively fighting them. They have been close friends since the 1990s, and the bribery charges revolve around their relationship. Dr. Melgen gave $700,000 through his company, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants, to the Senate Majority PAC, a so-called super PAC to support Senate Democrats, and instructed that the contributions aid Mr. Menendez’s 2012 re-election campaign. For the help Mr. Menendez received, prosecutors contend, the senator urged the Obama administration to alter the Medicare reimbursement policy in a way that would make millions for Dr. Melgen. In 2012 alone, Dr. Melgen received $21 million in Medicare reimbursements. In addition, prosecutors said, Mr. Menendez tried to push a port security deal that involved Dr. Melgen and worked to obtain United States travel visas for the doctor’s foreign girlfriends. Mr. Menendez was rewarded for his help, according to prosecutors, and received free trips on Dr. Melgen’s jet and spent three nights in an executive suite in Paris for a trip valued at nearly $5,000. After an ethics complaint was filed against Mr. Menendez for not reporting trips to the Dominican Republic as gifts, he wrote a $58,500 check to reimburse Dr. Melgen’s company. Federal investigators started to look into Dr. Melgen’s billings to Medicare because he was charging a significantly higher rate for a medication to treat macular degeneration than his peers were. The government said he billed for one vial of the medicine for each patient when he had in fact used one vial to treat three or four patients. Mr. Menendez came under federal scrutiny when he sought to help Dr. Melgen in the billing dispute, calling the Medicare director at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2009 and mentioning it at a meeting with the acting administrator in 2012.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-joseph-ponte-jails-rikers.html,"What has become a familiar defense for Mayor Bill de Blasio when he faces ethical questions about his behavior or that of officials in his administration can be boiled down to a simple, grade-school rejoinder: They said I could. Mr. de Blasio said as much in response to inquiries about his fund-raising practices that attracted state and federal scrutiny, about a political nonprofit he created to advocate for his policies, and about the designation of certain outside advisers — mostly friends and former campaign workers — as “agents of the city” whose communications he argued should be immune from public disclosure. The mayor offered a version of that defense again on Friday when city investigators disclosed in a report that the correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, had taken his city-issued car beyond the five boroughs on 90 days last year — mostly on trips to Maine — and had paid for gas and tolls with city money. Mr. Ponte’s absences coincided with a time of increasing violence at the Rikers Island jail complex and continuing reforms there that he was hired to put in place. “He was advised; he followed that guidance; that guidance was wrong,” Mr. de Blasio said during a weekly call-in radio appearance with WNYC’s Brian Lehrer. The mayor said his administration would fix the problem and “make everyone whole.” Soon after, his first deputy mayor issued a description of “additional protocols and safeguards” for the use of city vehicles. But Mr. de Blasio’s stance underscored his administration’s tendency to stress the care taken with issues of legality while appearing more casual, and sometimes even dismissive, of ethical questions. For instance, the mayor seemed unconcerned over the roughly $1,800 that Mr. Ponte spent on gas and tolls, often driving to and from his house in Maine, and the time he spent out of state. “I don’t begrudge someone if they need down time so long as they get the job done,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding of the spending on gas: “I want to remind you that I just released an $84 billion budget, so the fact that there’s a thousand dollars in gas expenses, you know, it’s put in perspective.” But some former city officials and government watchdogs found it hard to comprehend that an official who is in charge of a major department under a federal consent decree and responsible for addressing endemic violence in jails could be unfamiliar with the city’s basic conflict of interest rules. “It was clear to me we could not use city-owned vehicles at taxpayer expense for vacations or trips out of state,” said Florence Finkle, a former deputy commissioner for integrity and policy at the Correction Department who oversaw internal investigations. “If an emergency required us to return to Rikers, we had placards we could use with our personal vehicles to gain access to the island.” She cited an episode in which a correction worker lost vacation days for taking a department-issued vehicle to New Jersey. The department only learned of the infraction because an accident occurred, she said, indicating that such activity might be more widespread than is generally known. The Investigation Department’s report said that “21 senior-level employees routinely abused take-home vehicle privileges” and charged gas and tolls for personal trips to city taxpayers. The cases could result in fines from the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board. The mayor’s defense of Mr. Ponte led to an unusual back-and-forth between Mr. de Blasio and Mark G. Peters, the investigations commissioner, on Friday. “Commissioner Ponte and others did not receive official ‘advice’ that they could use their cars for personal trips out of state,” Mr. Peters, who was once the mayor’s campaign treasurer, said in a statement issued in response to the de Blasio administration’s statements to the media. “There can be no defense of this behavior and City Hall harms government integrity by even trying.” “Snooze,” wrote Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s press secretary, on Twitter. Later, in a telephone interview, Mr. Phillips said Mr. Ponte had not sought “formal written advice” but had consulted with “senior staff"" about “what the policy was and whether he was in accordance with it, and they said yes.” Still, the administration’s I-asked-and-they-said-it-was-O.K. defense struck some critics as a weak explanation for what seemed to be an ethical lapse clear enough to anyone ever entrusted with a company car. In most cases, city rules prohibit the use of government vehicles “for personal activities, except for required rest periods, meals, and brief stops incidental to the conduct of official city business.” Dick Dadey, the executive director of the Citizens Union, a watchdog group, said that Mr. Ponte’s “explanation rings hollow, and is even more suspect when you look at the administration’s use of lawyers to defend what are questionable practices that may not be illegal but certainly are unethical.” Mr. Dadey said Mr. Ponte “should be fired, both for being away so much and for the inappropriate use” of the car. Paul J. Massey Jr., the presumed Republican front-runner in this year’s mayoral race, issued a statement calling for Mr. Ponte to be fired, while the president of the correction officers’ union said he should resign. Although they essentially pleaded ignorance, Mr. Ponte and his top aides had every reason to be aware of the rules regarding the use of city-owned vehicles. In a March 2016 case, the Conflicts of Interest Board issued a $1,500 fine to Gregory Kuczinski, an assistant commissioner for investigations in the Correction Department, after he had a correction officer drive him, his wife and his children to the airport for a family vacation. Mr. Kuczinski, who was promoted by Mr. Ponte shortly after the fine, was also reprimanded on Friday for using his city-owned car for personal trips to airports and on a golf outing.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/new-york-schools-lead-water.html,"Last year, with fears about lead poisoning running high in the wake of the water crisis in Flint, Mich., New York City officials said that they had tested the water in all the city’s public schools and that the results should be reassuring: Only 1 percent of outlets had lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency’s action level of 15 parts per billion. But after The New York Times reported that the city had run the water in every outlet for two hours the night before taking the water samples, a process called flushing, experts said that the practice had most likely hidden lead problems. They said the city should throw out the results and redo the tests. In the end, the city did. On Friday, the new results were released, and they paint a starkly different picture: This time, 8 percent of outlets had lead levels above 15 parts per billion. And the vast majority of school buildings — 83 percent — had at least one outlet with a lead level above the threshold. The city had previously said that two-thirds of its roughly 1,500 school buildings had no outlets above the 15 parts per billion threshold. Flushing cleans most soluble lead and lead particles out of the pipes and thus reduces lead levels temporarily. Two schools in Queens were among the worst for the number of outlets involved. At Public School 95, the Eastwood School, in Jamaica, which has 1,500 students, 34 outlets had lead levels above the E.P.A. threshold. A water fountain in the cafeteria had a level of 3,200 parts per billion. Several other water fountains — in the cafeteria, a play area and a school hallway — had lead levels more than 40 times the E.P.A. action level. When the school was tested the first time, under the protocol that included the flushing, the highest level found was 35 parts per billion. At Public School/Intermediate School 208, in the Bellerose neighborhood, 36 outlets had lead levels above the threshold, including a classroom water fountain with a lead level of 1,740 parts per billion, and a faucet in a girls’ bathroom with a lead level of 8,850 parts per billion. When the school, which has about 700 students, was tested the first time, the highest level found was 24 parts per billion. In recent months, schools have sent letters home and posted them on their websites informing parents about the tests and the levels found in individual outlets. In January, the state released a summary of results from tests of about a third of the city’s school buildings. The city’s Education Department said every outlet where a sample exceeded the threshold had been turned off and would be turned on again only after it was replaced and new tests found levels below 15 parts per billion. Additionally, all schools where tests found at least one sample above the threshold have been put on a protocol of flushing the water every Monday morning before school starts. New cases of lead poisoning among children in New York City have declined significantly in the past decade. The city’s health department investigates cases of lead poisoning in children, and the Education Department said there had never been a known case of lead poisoning traced to drinking water in schools.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/kosciuszko-bridge-pronounciation.html,"The question is not whether a new Kosciuszko Bridge is needed (it is), nor whether a cable-stayed Kosciuszko Bridge looks better than the old through-truss crossing (it does). The question is: How is it pronounced? Tadeusz Kosciuszko — properly, Kościuszko — was a hero of the Revolutionary War. Born in Poland in 1746 and trained there as a military engineer, Kosciuszko arrived in America in 1776. The fortifications he designed along the Hudson River, most important at West Point, were widely credited with keeping British forces at bay. He later championed Polish nationhood, fighting bravely for what was then a lost cause. He died in exile in 1817 from his partitioned homeland. Poland was under German occupation in 1940 when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia named the new Meeker Avenue Bridge between Brooklyn and Queens in honor of Kosciuszko. Fifteen thousand Poles and Polish-Americans attended the ceremony. “I am confident that Poland will live again,” John J. Bennett Jr., the New York State attorney general, told the crowd. It was a stirring gesture and a fine reminder of America’s indebtedness to Poland. It has also caused nothing but grief ever since. New Yorkers have struggled to master the Polish pronunciation or — as they are given to doing — have invented their own. “There are many variations regarding Kosciuszko’s pronunciation,” Marta Hausman, the public diplomacy assistant at the Polish consulate general in New York, acknowledged by email. “The closest one is: ko-SHCH-OO-SH-ko.” Maciej Golubiewski, the consul general of Poland, nailed it on Thursday at the dedication of the new bridge. (“Kosciuszko Bridge Opening” on YouTube, at minute 12:25.) Of course, you would expect nothing less. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo came admirably close, but seemed to miss the second “sh.” (Minute 18:44.) The announcer, however, gave Kosciuszko a New York twist all its own: “Koch-ee-OH-sko.” (Minute 00:10.) Now, that is much more in line with such customary local pronunciations as “Kos-kee-OOS-ko” and “Kos-kee-OSS-ko.” It is easy to see why state officials simply call it the “K Bridge.” And it is not the only new bridge with a name that poses a pronunciation challenge. At the Goethals Bridge, new and old, some use a short “o,” others a long “o.” The third project is the New New York Bridge, which is to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge. It is pronounced “NOO-nyawk.” ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/amtrak-penn-station-disruptions.html,"TRENTON — Amtrak officials said on Friday that overhauling the tracks and rail equipment at Pennsylvania Station in New York would require two or three significant disruptions to commuting schedules over the summer. Precisely when the disruptions would occur and how long they would last, however, the officials could not say. They said they would meet next week with officials of commuter railroads in New Jersey and New York to decide how to schedule the track closings to limit their effects on the 600,000 train riders who pass through Penn Station each weekday. Amtrak should be ready to lay out its plan for the weekday disruptions by the week of May 8,, the railroad’s chief executive, Charles W. Moorman, told lawmakers at a hearing in Trenton. Mr. Moorman said Amtrak’s goal was to finish the most complicated repairs by Labor Day, and to then resume working on the tracks only at night and on weekends. He said he did not know how many weekdays would be disrupted but that “it’s certainly not going to be every day this summer.” Mr. Moorman said the disruptions would affect riders who use Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road, all of which share the tracks and platforms at Penn Station, North America’s busiest rail terminal. Amtrak, as the landlord at Penn Station, has drawn up a schedule for the work and will give officials with the commuter railroads a chance next week to respond to it and to suggest changes, Mr. Moorman said. “We are eager to work collaboratively together with New Jersey Transit,” he said. “In general, our organizations have a very good relationship at the ground level.” Steven Santoro, New Jersey Transit’s executive director, testified at the hearing after the Amtrak officials. He told lawmakers that his staff had just received the Amtrak proposal and had not had a chance to assess it. The plan to schedule track work at the station on weekdays is a change for Amtrak, whose traditional approach has been to limit work to late nights and weekends. But a series of derailments and other problems at and around the station in the past several weeks prompted Amtrak officials to alter their strategy. Assemblyman John McKeon, a Democrat, referred to a timeline of recent train troubles displayed on screens in the hearing room as a “30-day nightmare.” He said it was hypocritical of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to blame Amtrak for the problems, given that Mr. Christie, a Republican, had canceled a project meant to double the capacity for commuter trains between New Jersey and New York City. “The fact that the governor has the temerity to blame anyone but himself, pointing at Amtrak, is astounding to me,” Mr. McKeon said. On Thursday, Mr. Christie told reporters that he had been right to threaten to withhold payments to Amtrak for maintaining the station because Amtrak had accepted responsibility for the derailments and had decided to accelerate repairs. Mr. Santoro said that Mr. Christie’s goal in making the threat was to get Amtrak’s attention. “I think that attention’s been got,” Mr. Santoro said. ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/florence-finch-dead-coast-guard-war-hero.html,"Florence Finch was an atypical hometown hero. For nearly 50 years after World War II, virtually no one outside of her family knew that she was a highly decorated Coast Guard veteran and a former prisoner of war whose exploits had been buried in time. “Women don’t tell war stories like men do,” her daughter, Betty Murphy, of Ithaca, N.Y., said recently. And even on those rare occasions when she recalled her heroics in the Philippines — supplying fuel to the Filipino underground, sabotaging supplies destined for the Japanese occupiers, smuggling food to starving American prisoners and surviving torture after she was captured — Mrs. Finch did so with the utmost modesty. “I feel very humble,” she once said, “because my activities in the war effort were trivial compared with those of the people who gave their lives for their country.” It was perhaps reflective of that modesty that when she died on Dec. 8 at 101 in an Ithaca nursing home, the news did not travel widely. Newspapers in central New York carried a brief obituary, but her death went unreported virtually everywhere else. It was only after the announcement by the Coast Guard on Thursday that she would be buried with full military honors on Saturday at Pleasant Grove Cemetery in Cayuga Heights, N.Y., that word of her death spread nationwide. Indeed, the almost five-month delay in her memorial owed something to Mrs. Finch’s solicitous nature. Near death, she had made it clear that she did not want her funeral to disrupt her relatives’ Christmas holidays or to make mourners travel during a dark and icy Southern Tier winter. (Besides, she relished the annual resurgence wrought by spring.) So it was put off. The funeral is to be held in Ithaca, with the military honors coming afterward, a ceremony befitting this Philippine-born daughter of an American father and Filipino mother — one who, in 1947, received the Medal of Freedom (the forerunner of today’s Presidential Medal of Freedom), the nation’s highest award to a civilian. When the Japanese occupied the Philippines from 1942 to 1945, Mrs. Finch posed as a Filipino, but she became a United States citizen after the war. “Because she was over 18, she could have chosen to be American or Filipino,” Ms. Murphy said. “When the Japanese landed, she chose to be mum, but in her heart she had chosen to be an American.” Mrs. Finch was born Loring May Ebersole on Oct. 11, 1915, in Santiago, on Luzon Island in the northern Philippines. (It is unclear how her first name became Florence.) Her father, Charles, had fought in the Philippines for the Army during the Spanish-American War and remained there after it was over. Her mother was the former Maria Hermosa. Betty, as Mrs. Finch was known all her life, graduated from high school and was hired as a stenographer at Army Intelligence headquarters in Manila under Maj. E. C. Engelhart. While working there, she met Charles E. Smith, a Navy chief electrician’s mate. They married in August 1941, a few months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on Dec. 7. When the war did begin, Mr. Smith reported to his PT boat. He died on Feb. 8, 1942, trying to resupply American and Filipino troops trapped on Corregidor Island and the Bataan Peninsula. Five weeks earlier, Manila had fallen to the Japanese. Mrs. Finch (then Mrs. Smith) convinced the occupying forces that she was Filipino and, armed with superior penmanship, wangled a job writing gas rationing vouchers for the now Japanese-run Philippine Liquid Fuel Distributing Union. Unbeknown to her employer, however, she was actually collaborating with the Philippine resistance movement. Her job enabled her to divert precious fuel supplies to the underground and help sabotage shipments to the Japanese. After she learned of her husband’s death, her efforts became even more vigorous. (She was honored by the Philippine government in 2011.) Meanwhile, Major Englehart (he became a lieutenant colonel) managed to get word to her that he had been captured and that he and fellow war prisoners were being maltreated. She helped smuggle food, medicine, soap and clothing to them in a prison until she was caught. Confined to a two-by-four-foot cell, she was interrogated and then tortured, enduring repeated shocks from electrical clamps on her fingers. She never talked. She was tried and sentenced to three years’ hard labor at the Women’s Correctional Institution in Mandaluyong, just outside Manila. When she was finally freed by American troops on Feb. 10, 1945, she weighed 80 pounds. Rather than remain in her native country, she moved to Buffalo, where her father’s sister lived. She joined the Coast Guard Women’s Reserve, or the SPARs (a contraction of the Coast Guard motto “Semper Paratus” — Always Ready). She enlisted, she said, to avenge her husband. When her superiors learned of her wartime exploits, she was awarded the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Ribbon; the Coast Guard described her as the first woman to receive the decoration. The Medal of Freedom was bestowed for meritorious service. After the war ended, she was discharged as a seaman second class in 1946 and enrolled in secretarial school in New York City, where she met and married an Army veteran, Robert Finch. A chemist, he was hired by Agway, the agricultural products supplier, and moved the family to Ithaca. Mr. Finch died in 1968. In addition to her daughter, Betty, Mrs. Finch is survived by a son, Bob; a sister, Olive Keats; six grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. As Mrs. Finch was rearing her children and working as a secretary at Cornell University, her neighbors never suspected that they were in the presence of a war hero. In the early 1990s, though, she was rediscovered by the military after she completed a government questionnaire that she had received in conjunction with plans to erect the Women in Military Service for America Memorial in Washington. The Coast Guard named a building on Sand Island in Hawaii in her honor in 1995. Ms. Murphy decided to alert the news media about the building dedication, noting that her mother would be in attendance. “It was the first anyone knew,” Ms. Murphy said. “I figured it was time. And when she came home and people met her at the bus station, she was flabbergasted.” In 2015, the Coast Guard’s official blog said of Mrs. Finch, “Of the thousands of women who have served with honor in the United States Coast Guard, one stands out for her bravery and devotion to duty.” Her wartime legacy will be publicly honored again on Saturday by a military honor guard. But privately her heroism endured without medals, plaques or flags. “It had not defined her,” Ms. Murphy said, “but it defined how she lived her life.” ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/a-hospital-no-longer-afloat-but-buoyant-with-memories.html,"Jeffrey Delgado, an aspiring archivist from Queens College, has been telling friends that he went through yellowing documents and old photographs for an exhibit showcasing the history of the Floating Hospital. They all asked the same question: “Is it still on a boat?” The answer, as he learned from the some of the newest records he examined, is no. The Floating Hospital kept its name when it decommissioned its last vessel 15 years ago. But the material Mr. Delgado went through was high and dry in Long Island City, Queens, the Floating Hospital’s base since it moved to a permanent home on land. Now the finds from the Floating Hospital’s archives can be seen in an exhibition that he and two other archivists-in-training assembled under the supervision of full-fledged archivists at Citibank and the Queens Library. For generations, the Floating Hospital made medical care as carefree as a day at the beach by giving children a boat ride that included a checkup. It traced its origins to 1866, with rented barges, and its getaway mission to 1872, when The New York Times reported on newsboys playing in a park and observed that they would do well to get some fresh-air relief from the crowded, fetid city that they plied every day. Sean T. Granahan, the president and general counsel of the Floating Hospital, said it had 100,000 photographs and other evidence “of our epic 150-year journey through health care” that needed to be reviewed, assessed and preserved. The archive project came about when officials at Citibank put the Floating Hospital in touch with the Queens Library, which works with community-based organizations in Queens “that have amazing material but don’t have archivists to make them available to the public,” said Natalie Milbrodt, the library’s director of metadata services and the director of its Queens Memory program. The library also maintains the Citi Center for Culture Queens Library Fellowship for graduate students like Mr. Delgado. So the Floating Hospital became an assignment for the three recipients of this year’s fellowships. In addition to Mr. Delgado, they are Regina Carra, who like Mr. Delgado is working on dual master’s degrees, one in history, the other in library science, and Pamela Griffin-Hansen, a candidate for a master’s degree in library science and archives at St. John’s University. Each received a stipend of $1,000. Kerri Anne Burke, the global curator of Citigroup’s Citi Heritage Collection, said the students made recommendations on how to take care of the Floating Hospital’s files and artifacts, and then went to work designing the exhibit. Mr. Delgado and Ms. Carra worked on the layout, while Ms. Griffin-Hansen prepared labels to go with the photographs and the items they had chosen. The exhibition fills six display cases near the food court in the Citigroup building at One Court Square in Long Island City. Among the items is a bell from the Helen C. Juilliard II, the second of the Floating Hospital’s five vessels. Seeing it in the display case prompted a question: Did they ring it? No, Mr. Delgado said: “We’re archivists.” Another find was a guest log from 1899, with the names of everyone who boarded the ship. Mr. Delgado remembered what flashed through his mind as he picked up the log: “I have to be careful with this book right now — it’s really fragile.” “We were jumping for joy because we didn’t think we’d find anything so well preserved,” he said. “I checked for water damage, like a good archivist should.” But there was not much. “They didn’t find any mold or the kinds of things you often find when you’re looking at a collection for the first time,” said Ms. Milbrodt of the Queens Library. She said that the Floating Hospital had “kept their materials in really good condition.” They also caught up on the organization’s recent past. Terrorism doomed the floating part of the Floating Hospital. The organization abandoned ship after the 9/11 attacks. It turned its last vessel, anchored off Lower Manhattan, into an emergency clinic as the twin towers fell. In time, the vessel was moved to Brooklyn, where it was used as offices; the medical care was provided at clinics around the city that the Floating Hospital had opened in the 1990s. The Floating Hospital was also struggling financially, with $6 million in debt, according to Mr. Granahan. The group sold the ship, actually a barge, and refocused on land-based ways to provide care that would generate sufficient reimbursements. It now describes itself as the largest charity health care provider for families in the city’s homeless shelters and domestic-violence centers. Not everything the archivists-in-training turned up went into the exhibit. “I found a lot of blueprints of Seaside Hospital before it was a thing,” Mr. Delgado said, referring to a nursery and medical care facility in New Dorp, Staten Island, that the Floating Hospital ran from 1881 until the mid-1960s. “I wanted to incorporate them,” he said, but they were too big to digitize and too fragile to mount in the display cases.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/realestate/marketing-for-luxury-real-estate.html,"After a burst of construction, the luxury real estate market is awash with million- and multimillion-dollar homes for sale. Buyers are taking their time before signing on the dotted line, and sales agents and brokers have had to get more creative in drawing attention to their listings. “We’ve seen buyers come see an apartment four or five times and they’re still on the fence,” said Steven Rutter, director of Stribling Marketing Associates, a division of Stribling & Associates. “There’s no sense of urgency.” Luxury, of course, is a relative term when it comes to New York City, where the average price of a condominium keeps rising and is currently $3.2 million, according to the latest report from CityRealty.com. The definition of which home can be referred to as “luxury” changes, and is now determined to be about $4.5 million and above, or the top 10 percent of the market, said Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. StreetEasy’s data show more than 2,500 homes priced at or above $3 million as of last week, with more than half of those listings at or above $5 million. Mr. Miller calculates that 6,000 apartments from new development, many in the million- and multimillion-dollar price range, hit the market in Manhattan in 2016. He estimated that 3,000 units would be introduced this year, and another 2,000 units in 2018. Even though some buyers are taking their time in sorting through this oversupply, they are still willing to sign contracts. And prices are generally stable, though with some exceptions. Apartments priced in the $1 million to $3 million range may prompt a bidding war, but most homes $5 million and under are selling well. Many offerings over $10 million have been discounted already, and some can be negotiated down as much as 30 percent more, brokers say. The market was off to a good start this year. There were 330 contracts signed in the first quarter of 2017, a 33 percent increase from the same period last year, according to a report from Olshan Realty Inc., which tracks sales in this price range. This is evidence that buyers are pulling the trigger, even if they are taking their time about it. Still, brokers have to find new ways to make their offerings stand out. To introduce the sale of an $11.75 million, four-bedroom penthouse in Midtown, Tara King-Brown and Amy Williamson, two associate brokers from the Corcoran Group, ditched the evening cocktail party, the industry’s tried-and-tested event, and instead held a morning meditation class in the building’s common-area yoga room. About a dozen people, mostly brokers, attended the class, which was run by MNDFL, a firm that runs several meditation studios throughout the city. After a 30-minute session of deep breathing and reflection as the sun rose over the East River, the group got a tour of the penthouse at 305 East 51st Street. “What’s fantastic about this place is the view and morning light so we wanted the brokers to feel it for themselves,” Ms. King-Brown said. “Hosting a different type of networking event is necessary to stand out, especially since buyers have so much to choose from.” To draw attention to a $6.995 million, four-bedroom condo at 6 Cortlandt Alley, Susan Wires, a Stribling saleswoman, held a continuing education class run by the firm TitleVest called “Condominium Essentials” for agents and brokers in the residence. She said it helped “get a lot of eyes on this building since we’re a small, new development, not a large tower that gets a lot of attention.” Fredrik Eklund, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman and a cast member of the television show “Million Dollar Listing New York,” recently invited 55 so-called Instagram influencers, or those with the most followers in the city, to a four-bedroom, $20.75 million home at Madison Square Park Tower. Ripping a page out of fashion marketing, where social media stars are invited to post photos and comment on designer wear and store openings, Mr. Eklund allowed the group to post photos from the apartment on the 56th floor. He admitted that the move was a little risky, since he didn’t check to see what everyone was posting. “But if you’re an Instagram influencer, you’re creative, a good photographer,” so you’re guaranteed a good shot, he said. “They were happy to have access to an apartment with a gorgeous view, plus I reached a non-real-estate audience.” The event generated more than 100 postings on the building, eliciting over 150,000 interactions (likes, comments, views) and reached over five million Instagram users who follow the invited social media influencers. The building’s own Instagram page immediately signed up about 1,000 new followers after the event, now totaling about 14,600. Mr. Eklund said a Chinese fashion designer who was in town in February for fashion week made an appointment to see an apartment after the Instagram blitz. He said many younger buyers check information on a property through social media even before looking at the building’s website. Many developers and brokers like to turn a model showroom or listing into a temporary art gallery and give parties, an easy guest list to compile because buyers of high-end art and real estate tend to overlap. Vickey Barron, a broker at Douglas Elliman, said she prefers smaller get-togethers. To drive attention to a Chelsea condominium building, she organized a small breakfast with the developer and several brokers. “I gave my friends access to someone they wouldn’t otherwise have,” she said. “The result is, though, you’re pulling people together that help you get a contract signed.” To get a jump on selling new homes built by the Farrell Building Company in the Hamptons, Andrew Azoulay, also an Elliman broker, opened a pop-up showroom in TriBeCa, thought to be the first for Hamptons real estate. He is organizing weekly events, which include child-friendly gatherings like movie nights and a block party. The kicker: a free helicopter ride for potential buyers. So far, he has used the helicopter only once, to show a couple a nearly $16 million home in Water Mill, N.Y. The couple didn’t take that particular home, Mr. Azoulay said, but are interested in a custom-built one from the developer. Mr. Azoulay has sold 10 homes since the start of the year. “And the season is just starting,” he said. ",New York Times,0

He is surrounded by images of French politicians under the heading: “The truth about Macron’s galaxy.” It doesn’t take much fluency in racist propaganda to see what is going on: here is the liberal candidate in France’s presidential election as archetypal Jewish conspirator at the hub of global capitalism and communism. The cartoon was posted a few weeks ago from the official Twitter account of Les Républicains, the party of François Fillon, a conservative rival for the presidency. It was quickly deleted. Fillon apologised and said errant staff would be disciplined. The election caravan moved on to bigger scandals. Emmanuel Macron is Catholic but that doesn’t confer immunity from vintage antisemitism. He worked for Rothschild, the investment bank, which every Jew-spotting paranoiac knows is synonymous with Israelite global manipulation.

Despite everything, its citizens have never had it so good | Natalie Nougayrède           Read more       Yet the economic order that has prevailed without substantial challenge since the early 1990s looks brittle. Frustration at the impotence and self-absorption of a professional political class is epidemic. So is the perception that a financial elite has captured the proceeds of growth and that opportunities available to the next generation are more paltry than those enjoyed by their parents. The future of the west is shrouded in despondency – a feeling of epochal stagnation underscored by the relative dynamism of wrecker candidates preaching political sabotage. Perhaps collective inability to imagine what comes next is a factor reanimating the past. Or maybe at times of stress whole cultures, like individuals, fall back on gut reactions, fears and prejudices that rational cognition might overrule in calmer moments. Whatever the cause, there is something visceral and subliminal about the way politics across the west is fidgeting with anti-Jewish idioms. Whether intentional or not, there is antique spite lurking in the fashionable analysis that laments the excessive influence of “metropolitan elites” and “citizens of nowhere”. Soviet propaganda queried the patriotism of “rootless cosmopolitans”. When a Facebook army of the radical left rushes to defend Ken Livingstone from accusations of antisemitism, while depicting him as the victim of a campaign by “Zionists” or a shadowy “Israel lobby” that dictates the media’s script, it is worth pondering the etymology of that rhetoric. Nor has the normalisation of Islamophobia happened overnight. There are complex currents of anxiety arising from terrorist attacks in recent years and their conflation in public discourse with refugee flight from the Middle East and north Africa. But the deliberate misrepresentation by nationalists of an entire religion as a fifth column, harbouring who knows what level of murderous impulse, conjures a different spectre. Marine Le Pen in France and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands activate centuries-old reflexes of Christian recoil against the idea of encroaching Islam.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/03/dangerous-attitudes-on-the-streets-of-croydon,"It’s all too easy to blame Brexit for last week’s horrific assault in Croydon (Report, 3 April) that has left a teenage Kurdish-Iranian asylum seeker fighting for his life, but problems in this London borough are more longstanding. In July 1992, Ruhullah Aramesh, an Afghan refugee living in the Thornton Heath area of the borough, was beaten to death in a racist attack by six white youths armed with iron bars and lumps of wood. Many other racist assaults occurred there during that decade. In 2011 a woman was filmed delivering a racist rant against black people and Poles on the Croydon tram. In January 2014 the English Defence League began targeting an Islamic community centre in Croydon as an “illegal mosque”. In June 2015 a woman had her hijab violently pulled off in a Croydon street. In October that year there was a high-profile immigration raid on Croydon works premises which resulted in seven arrests. Six of those arrested were transferred to detention centres pending their deportation. The immediate responsibility for the recent sickening attack lies with the perpetrators, but a share of responsibility surely also may lie with every media outlet, political organisation and government institution that has fuelled a toxic atmosphere against minorities and asylum seekers. And that includes the last home secretary, Theresa May, who sent her vans with anti-immigrant threats around the streets of areas such as Croydon until they were withdrawn. Even the local Tory MP, Gavin Barwell, welcomed their withdrawal.David RosenbergLondon • On behalf of Young Roots, I want to express how devastated I am about the attack on the young asylum seeker in Croydon on Friday. We are heartbroken by this brutal crime. Many young asylum seekers have fled war, torture and other atrocities. They have survived dangerous journeys here and face loneliness, worries about the rest of their family, and the challenge of navigating the complex immigration system. A large number have post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet the young people we work with in Croydon are a delight. They are bright, warm, friendly and so keen to learn. They are endlessly supportive and kind. Our thoughts are with the victim of this alleged hate crime, and we will continue to work hard to support the young refugee and asylum-seeking community in Croydon to be safe and come to terms with this terrible attack.Jo CobleyDirector, Young Roots – helping young refugees reach their potential • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters",The Guardian,1
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/03/croydon-attack-comes-as-charities-report-growing-number-of-hate-crimes,"The attack on a teenage asylum seeker in Croydon last Friday comes as reports of abuse directed at refugee children are becoming more frequent, charities and experts have warned. As Reker Ahmed, the 17-year-old Kurdish Iranian who was attacked, recovered in hospital on Monday, those involved in supporting asylum-seeking children expressed dismay at the attack.     Toxic political agenda is dehumanising entire groups, Amnesty warns           Read more       Andy Elvin, chief executive of the fostering organisation Tact, which has looked after hundreds of asylum-seeking children across the country, said he was aware of a number of children in his organisation’s care who had been verbally abused in the streets, and he believed this was a growing problem. “It is verbal abuse – about their status, what they are doing in this country, why they don’t go back,” he said. The organisation runs support groups, advising newly arrived asylum seeking children on how to respond to negative experiences. It was particularly an issue which young people encountered on public transport, he said.  “We have made several reports to the police of hate crimes. We think it is rising. It is entirely linked to the environment that has been created by the public discourse about people coming to this country from overseas ... Asylum seekers are all seen as bogus – not as children, not traumatised, not in need, just freeloaders coming here to take advantage of the system.” Usually the abuse came as a complete surprise to the young people, Elvin added. “They didn’t expect to be targeted in this way. The perception of the UK abroad is still that it is a fair equitable country, where people are treated decently.”  Croydon currently has just over 400 unaccompanied child asylum seekers, a higher number than most local authorities, because it is the location of Lunar House, the government office where people must go to claim asylum.But a council spokesperson said: “This type of incident is extremely rare and our experience has been that the vast majority of young asylum seekers have been welcomed into the community.” Most of the younger child refugees in Croydon and elsewhere are accommodated by the council in foster families, and will go to school in the borough. The older ones, aged 16 or 17, are more likely to be found beds in supported accommodation, and may attend English classes, but will not be in school. Some councils provide acclimatisation sessions for newly arrived refugee children, educating them about British laws, the risks posed by drugs and their personal safety, but often the older arrivals are left largely unsupported to fend for themselves. Liz Clegg, who worked with child asylum seekers in Calais and is now helping child refugees to settle in the UK, said most were entirely unprepared for hostility. “They think: ‘Oh, now we’re in the UK, we’re completely safe.’ They have fled conflict zones and think they have arrived in the promised land; they have a very positive outlook. We have to educate them that there are still serious dangers, that they need to be careful for their personal safety.” Gulwali Passarlay, author of The Lightless Sky, an account of coming to the UK as a lone child asylum seeker from Afghanistan, said that attitudes towards refugees had hardened in recent months.  He highlighted the negative effect of the reporting of the arrival of child refugees from Calais last October (where the ages of the asylum seekers were questioned in some parts of the media), stoking cynicism about child refugees’ asylum claims, and dramatically souring a popular mood of support for child refugees that had followed the drowning of the three-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi in 2015. “The environment has changed. People with rightwing views think it is OK to insult asylum seekers. There are a lot of good people in the UK but the mood is changing. Asylum seekers need to be cautious; it’s not always safe to walk around UK cities,” he said. Josie Naughton, co-founder of Help Refugees, said the attack demonstrated “the level of fear and prejudice which is taking hold of parts of British society”. Rabbi Janet Darley, who works with Citizens UK’s Safe Passage project, which supports unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, said: “This is a sobering reminder of the importance of the need to create a welcoming society, where refugees feel welcomed and accepted.” Donations to a crowd-funding site for the victim had reached over £10,000 by Monday afternoon. Bridie Watson, who launched the fundraising drive, had no personal contact with the victim, but was liaising with the police and social services to make sure the victim received the money. “It was so horrific. We wanted to help people put their shock and love into something positive. We want to show that this is not what the UK is about,” she said.",The Guardian,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/27/new-york-stabbing-hate-crime-james-jackson-timothy-caughman,"A white suspect accused of the fatal stabbing of a black man on a Manhattan street has been indicted on a charge of murder as an act of terrorism. James Harris Jackson, 28, appeared briefly in court on Monday and did not speak. Prosecutors had previously also charged him with murder as a hate crime. Jackson’s attorney had no comment.     White veteran 'regarded fatal stabbing of black man as practice for larger attack'           Read more       Jackson is accused of killing Timothy Caughman, 66, a stranger to him. Caughman was attacked from behind last week as he was collecting bottles for recycling. An arraignment on the indictment has been set for 13 April. Speaking with a reporter for the Daily News at New York City’s Rikers Island jail complex, Jackson said he had intended it as “a practice run” in a mission to deter interracial relationships. He said he envisioned a white woman thinking: “Well, if that guy feels so strongly about it, maybe I shouldn’t do it.” Caughman, who was remembered as a gentleman and a good neighbor, was alone when he was attacked from behind with a sword. He staggered, bleeding, into a police station and later died at a hospital. “Tim Caughman did not deserve to die like that,” said Portia Clark, a childhood friend who grew up in Queens and attended the hearing with Caughman’s other friends on Monday. “Nobody does. I mean, come on, we’re black, white, yellow, brown – that’s ridiculous. We’re trying to get along.” Carl Nimmons wept outside court after seeing Jackson. “It really hurt me to see that man, because I can’t do nothing about it. I don’t have the power to do anything about it,” he said. In the Rikers interview, Jackson said in retrospect that he would rather have killed “a young thug” or “a successful older black man with blondes ... people you see in Midtown. These younger guys that put white girls on the wrong path”. He complained that on television, “it’s like every other commercial in the past few years has a mixed-race couple in it”. “The white race is being eroded ... No one cares about you. The Chinese don’t care about you, the blacks don’t care about you,” he said. Jackson, who was raised in what was described as a churchgoing, liberal family in a Baltimore suburb, said his ideal society was “1950s America”. Jackson was in the army from 2009 to 2012 and worked as an intelligence analyst, the army said. Deployed in Afghanistan in 2010 until 2011, he earned several medals and attained the rank of specialist. The military training, Jackson said, helped him plan the bloodshed. “I had been thinking about it for a long time, for the past couple of years,” he said. “I figured I would end up getting shot by police, kill myself, or end up in jail.” His attorney, Sam Talkin, has said if the allegations are anywhere close to being true, “then we’re going to address the obvious psychological issues that are present in this case”.",The Guardian,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/24/new-york-hate-crime-stabbing-james-jackson-timothy-caughman,"A white military veteran accused of a hate crime for the stabbing death of a black man in New York regarded the attack as “practice” for a larger assault he hoped to carry out in Times Square, court documents claim. James Jackson, 26, was arrested hours after allegedly stabbing Timothy Caughman to death in Manhattan on Wednesday. According to prosecutors, Jackson, a Maryland resident, traveled to New York for his attack with the intention of killing “as many black men as possible”. “Mr Jackson regarded the killing as practice prior to going to Times Square to kill additional black men,” according to court documents obtained by the New York Daily News. Police investigators said Jackson admitted to the murder during questioning. Prosecutors said Jackson plunged a 2ft sword into the chest of Caughman, a self-described “can and bottle recycler”, as Caughman bent over a trash bin near his home. The 66-year-old, whose social media accounts are full of pictures with celebrities such as Beyoncé and Oprah, managed to stagger into a nearby police station, from which he was transported to a hospital and later died. “The defendant was motivated purely by hatred,” said the assistant district attorney Joan Illuzzi, who added that the charges could be upgraded, “as this was an act most likely of terrorism”. Prosecutors said Jackson hated black men, especially those who dated white women. According to investigators, Jackson, a decorated veteran of the Afghanistan war, had harbored his beliefs for at least a decade – at one point having been recorded on tape stalking black men. Dr Scott Krugman, chairman of pediatrics at Franklin Square medical center in Baltimore and a friend of the Jackson family, said the allegations were out of character with his family’s beliefs and the way he was raised. Jackson’s parents, David and Patricia Jackson, are active members of Towson Presbyterian church and have two other sons. Patricia Jackson is a former teacher of English-language students in the Baltimore County school system and worked for Well for the Journey, a Christian not-for-profit organization that helps people “integrate spirituality into their daily lives in a safe, inclusive space”. “They’re liberal as liberal can be,” Krugman said. “We were at a dinner party with them and everybody was complaining about the current administration and very open about rights for everybody and making sure we’re not excluding immigrants, everything like that. I’m just beyond shocked right now.” In a statement, the Jackson family extended condolences to Caughman’s family and said it was “shocked, horrified and heartbroken by this tragedy”.",The Guardian,1
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/15/beware-jews-road-sign-north-london-reported-police,"A photographer and artist behind a red-triangle warning sign depicting the silhouette of an Orthodox Jewish man has apologised for causing offence after a Jewish neighbourhood watch group reported it as a hate crime. Franck Allais, a freelance photographer, said the contentious sign was part of an artistic project, which includes depictions of a woman pulling a shopping trolley, a man pushing his wheelchair and a cat. Allais said he intended the project to be a comment on identity and that the sign in Stamford Hill, one of the largest Hasidic communities in Europe, was not an antisemitic statement. He said he was left shaken by the offence he had caused. He said: “It was a project about crossing the road … how everyone is different, everyone has an identity. There is not only one sign in the street. I put more signs up in the street, but only this one got noticed. I am sorry for any offence caused.” Shomrim, a Jewish neighbourhood watch group that reported the sign to the Metropolitan police and Hackney council, said earlier it had caused “alarm and distress to local people”. Stamford Hill is at the centre of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish and mainly Hasidic community estimated to number about 30,000 people. Barry Bard, Shomrim’s operational supervisor in the area, said: “The people of Stamford Hill are very sadly used to instances of antisemitic hate crime, but most of those times it will be verbal abuse or even assault. A lot of the time it will be more of a person-to-person kind of thing, or graffiti, which is more unprofessional.” Allais, who has done work for Guardian Weekend, the Saturday and Sunday Telegraph, FT Weekend magazine, the Independent on Sunday, Newsweek and Time Out, said he had created the signs based on real people he saw crossing the road in the areas where the signs were later hung and photographed. Some of the other signs have since been spotted.

Family members performed the last rites on his body, which had been brought to his home state of Telangana from Kansas on Monday night.  Kuchibhotla’s mother, Parvatha Vardhini, said she would not allow her younger son to return to the US. “I had asked him [Srinivas] to return to India if he was feeling insecure there. But he used to say he was safe and secure,” she said.     Have you seen or been a victim of a hate crime since Trump's election?

What crime did he commit?” The funeral was held hours after Adam Purinton, 51, a navy veteran, appeared in court in Houston, charged with Kuchibhotla’s murder, the attempted murder of his friend Alok Madasanim and a third man, Ian Grillot, 24, who was wounded when he tried to intervene. Kuchibhotla and Madasanim went to the US to study and worked as engineers at GPS maker, Garmin. Witnesses said Purinton shouted “get out of my country” before opening fire. According to a bartender who called 911, Purinton said he had shot “two Iranian people”.  The FBI is investigating whether the shooting constitutes a hate crime, the maximum sentence for which is death penalty. The incident has raised concerns about the treatment in the US of immigrants, who feel targeted by Donald Trump’s promises to ban certain travellers and build a wall along the Mexico border, and left India and the Indian community in the US in shock. The Telangana American Telugu Association urged its members to speak English in public places. “Much as we love talking in our mother tongue, it can often be misconstrued. Please see if you can communicate in English in public places,” a statement from the organisation said. Last week, Kuchibhotla’s widow, Sunaya Dumala, appealed to the US government to do more to prevent hate crimes. “We’ve read many times in newspapers of some kind of shooting happening. And we always wondered, how safe? I need an answer from the government … What are they going to do?” she said. Hillary Clinton, the losing Democratic candidate in last year’s election, tweeted a link to an article about the shooting and wrote: “With threats & hate crimes on rise, we shouldn’t have to tell @POTUS to do his part. He must step up & speak.” Trump has not commented on the killing. The White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, said last week that linking the death to Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric was “absurd”.",The Guardian,1

From acts of antisemitic vandalism and religious discrimination in the workplace to the allegedly targeted shooting of two Indian immigrants and a plot to bomb a refugee community, evidence anecdotally suggests this alarming trend may continue throughout 2017. That’s why Guardian US, along with other major American newsrooms, advocacy groups and academic institutions, is joining the Documenting Hate project. Led by the not-for-profit news organisation ProPublica, Documenting Hate will attempt to better record these instances and provide rigorous analysis, data-driven investigation, and deep reporting on the issue. The federal government keeps a flawed and heavily time-lagged record of hate crimes in the US. Much like its monitoring of the number of people police kill every year, the FBI relies on information supplied voluntarily by the 18,000 police departments around the country, meaning thousands of departments report no data at all, while others may simply not be submitting a complete record. Guardian US is asking readers to submit information, through the form below, if you have witnessed or been the victim of a suspected hate crime, defined by the FBI as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity”.  We would also like to hear from you if you have experienced an incident driven by hatred and prejudice, which may not constitute a crime. Reporters at Guardian US and other news organisations will work to verify submissions and will not share your name and contact information with anyone outside the project. The incidents will be added to a national database of hate crimes and targeted intimidation, which will inform our broader reporting of the issue.",The Guardian,1
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/22/toxic-political-agenda-dehumanising-entire-groups-amnesty-warns,"Toxic political rhetoric with echoes of 1930s hate speech is stirring up violence worldwide – including in the UK and US, Amnesty International has warned. Kerry Moscoguiri, Amnesty UK’s director of campaigns, said that campaigning for the Brexit referendum “was a particular low point, with all too real consequences” – pointing to a 57% spike in reported hate crime the week after the vote. She accused the British government of “creating a hostile climate for refugees and migrants” as it shirked its responsibilities to them, particularly unaccompanied children. But the UK was not alone in seeing vicious rhetoric targeting the most vulnerable, as 2016 saw leaders worldwide peddling “the dangerous idea that some people are less human than others”, according to Amnesty’s director of crisis research Tirana Hassan.     FBI reports hate crimes against Muslims surged by 67% in 2015           Read more       She pointed particularly to violence stirred up by Donald Trump, right-wing Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, who called a controversial referendum on refugees, and the Philippines leader Rodrigo Duterte who has launched a war on drugs that has cost thousands of lives. “This report documents the very real human consequences of politicians like Trump, Orbán, Duterte, wielding a toxic agenda that hounds, scapegoats and dehumanises entire groups of people,” Hassan said. The attacks threaten not just human lives but the value system enshrined in international law after the second world war, warned the NGO.  “When language around ‘taking our country back’ and ‘making America great again’ is coupled with proposals to treat EU migrants like bargaining chips or to ban refugees on the grounds of religion, it fosters deep hatred and mistrust and sends a strong message that some people are entitled to human rights and others aren’t,” said Kate Allen, Director of Amnesty International UK. “Have we forgotten that human rights protections were created after the mass atrocities of the second world war as a way of making sure that ‘never again’ actually meant ‘never again’?”     Politicians fuelled rise in hate crimes after Brexit vote, says UN body           Read more       It was a year filled with contempt for those ideals, Amnesty warned, from the almost “routine” bombing of hospitals in Syria and Yemen, to violent suppression of dissent and attacks on refugees and migrants.  Worldwide, 36 countries broke international law and forced refugees back into conflict zones or places where their rights were at risk, it said.  The report was particularly damning of the failure to halt the brutal bombing of rebel-held east Aleppo, in the final stages of a Russian-backed campaign, when chemical weapons and bunker-buster bombs were used against civilians. That inaction “called to mind similar failures in Rwanda and Srebrenica in 1994 and 1995”, the report said, and was a damning indictment of major powers and the UN, paralysed by their rivalries as civilians suffered. “Never have these failures been as apparent as in December 2016, when we all witnessed the graphic and brutal bombardment of Aleppo, when war crimes were essentially beamed into our living rooms,” Moscogiuri said.                Facebook        Twitter        Pinterest         The far right in Britain - video explainer    The British government is criticised in the report for stepping up digital surveillance with the new “snooper’s charter”, which allows the state disturbing access to private lives of its citizens. “By introducing one of the broadest regimes for mass surveillance of any country in the world, the UK took a significant step towards a reality where the right to privacy is simply not recognised,” the report said. It was not all bleak. Amnesty also noted how fierce repression had inspired courage and resistance around the world, from the people of the Gambia who threw off 22 years off dictatorship in a peaceful election, to the Olympic protest of Ethiopian marathon medallist Feyisa Lilesa, and the young “clown of Aleppo”. Lilesa drew attention to the struggles of his Oromo tribe by crossing his arms over his head as he reached the finish line, a gesture of defiance that could potentially have cost him the medal.  The 24-year-old entertainer Anas al-Basha chose to stay in besieged Aleppo to bring some distraction and relief to its children, and died there in an airstrike in December. “Ultimately, the charge that human rights is a project of the elite rings hollow,” the report said. “People’s instincts for freedom and justice do not simply wither away.”",The Guardian,1

Share your stories           Read more       The CST’s chief executive, David Delew, said: “While Jewish life in this country remains overwhelmingly positive, this heightened level of antisemitism is deeply worrying and appears to be getting worse. Worst of all is that, for various reasons, some people clearly feel more confident to express their antisemitism publicly than they did in the past.” The 2014 spike in incidents was attributed to the war in Gaza, deemed to be a “trigger event”. However no such trigger was identified for 2016. Instead, the CST said, there may have been a “cumulative effect of a series of events and factors that, taken together, have created an atmosphere in which more antisemitic incidents are occurring”. The factors included terrorist attacks in Europe, high profile allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party and a perceived increase in racism and xenophobia following the Brexit referendum, as well as the 2014 Gaza war. The 1,309 antisemitic incidents recorded in 2016 included 107 violent assaults, up 29% on the previous year; 65 incidents of damage and desecration to Jewish property; and 1,006 incidents of abusive behaviour, including verbal abuse, graffiti and on social media. Social media had become “an essential tool for coordinated campaigns of antisemitic harassment, abuse and threats directed at Jewish politicians, student activists and other individuals, perpetrated by transnational networks of online antisemitic activists, some of whom are involved in extremist politics,” the CST said. Over three-quarters of incidents were recorded in Greater London and Greater Manchester, where the majority of British Jews live. Greater London saw a 65% increase incidents on the previous year. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the government would continue “to do all we can to stamp out these vile attacks and encourage those who experience them to come forward”. Antisemitism was “a deplorable form of hatred that has absolutely no place in a tolerant, open and diverse Britain that works for everyone”. Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, said the CST’s findings were “extremely distressing”. He added: “I don’t want to live in a country where any member of the Jewish community feels unsafe, afraid or discriminated against … We must root out antisemitism whenever it takes place and wherever it exists, as a party and a country.”",The Guardian,1

Blasphemy is a criminal offence in Muslim-majority Pakistan that can result in the death penalty. Even being accused of blasphemy can provoke targeted acts of violence by religious rightwing vigilantes.  Aamir Liaquat Hussain, who describes his programme aired on Bol TV as the country’s leading television show, had been at the forefront of a campaign to discredit liberal activists who went missing this month, as well as those defending them. In a document sent to Bol TV and seen by Reuters, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority said Liaquat’s show “wilfully and repeatedly made statements and allegations which (are) tantamount to hate speech, derogatory remarks, incitement to violence against citizens and casting accusations of being anti-state and anti-Islam.”  Liaquat did not answer calls to his mobile telephone on Thursday and representatives of Bol TV were not immediately available for comment.  He had blamed several prominent Pakistanis for an anti-state agenda and being either sympathetic to, or directly involved in, blasphemy against Islam’s founder, the prophet Muhammad.  In 2011, the governor of Punjab province, Salman Taseer, was assassinated by one of his bodyguards after he called for reform of the country’s blasphemy laws.

At least 65 others have been murdered over blasphemy allegations since 1990, according to figures from the Center for Research and Security Studies thinktank and media.  Liaquat, famous for combining religion and gameshows, has often courted controversy. He once gave away abandoned babies during a broadcast and caused uproar by airing vitriolic hate speech against the Ahmadi minority.  One of the targets of Liaquat’s show was activist lawyer Jibran Nasir, who filed a police complaint under Pakistan’s anti-terrorism law on Thursday charging him with “running a defamatory and life-threatening campaign”.  Classical dancer Sheema Kirmani received death threats after Liaquat targeted her on his 19 January broadcast.  Classical dance was banned and associated with obscenity under the regime of military dictator Zia ul Haq, who pushed for greater “Islamisation” of Pakistan in the 1980s.  The situation is potentially worse now than during the Zia era, Kirmani said. “Previously the government could close the auditorium, or arrest you, but now anyone sitting in the audience can decide ‘I am not going to allow this.’”",The Guardian,1

Sadiq Khan said the city remained inclusive and global, following four antisemitic attacks over the weekend. He made the remarks as he met genocide survivors at City Hall at the first in a series of events in the lead-up to Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January. A spokesperson for Scotland Yard said on Sunday that officers were investigating four hate crime allegations aimed towards north London’s Jewish community.  Speaking after Monday’s event, Khan said: “I ask all Londoners to report any form of hate crime, no matter how trivial.

David Isaac, chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), told a hearing of MPs he was worried the start of formally leaving the bloc could cause a backlash against EU citizens, similar to the period of increased hate crime that followed the EU referendum, and was calling on police to be prepared for such an eventuality. Theresa May has promised to trigger article 50 before the end of March but it could come earlier than that now she has set out her plans to leave the single market in order to secure immigration controls and remove the UK from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.      Poles in UK fear spike in hate crimes when Brexit process begins           Read more       The government is now awaiting the outcome of a supreme court decision about whether parliament will have to pass an act approving Brexit before it can go ahead. Ahead of that ruling, Isaac told MPs on the women and equalities committee that the EHRC was “hugely concerned about what might happen in relation to an increase in hate crime” when article 50 is triggered.  “And so, to give you examples of what we are seeking to do, we are meeting with groups, we are seeking to ensure that there is as much police protection and understanding in relation to hate crimes as is possible,” he said. “And, I think, given our role, I believe, we are uniquely placed to be doing all of this at a time when Britain needs guidance in relation to huge anxiety that resides, not just in relation to non-UK citizens and our visitors, but actually many of our own citizens.”  Highlighting the rise in hate crime over the summer, he said: “One of the things that concerns us greatly is the position in relation to the spike in hate crimes since 23 June. I’ve met with the Polish ambassador, my opposite number in Poland, because of the large number of attacks against the Polish community, but I am also in touch with various other groups.”  The prime minister’s spokeswoman said the government would “certainly not want” a surge in hate crimes, when asked if May shared Isaac’s concerns. “The prime minister has taken a very strong and clear stance on our commitment to continuing to be an open and tolerant nation and to stamp out hate crime wherever it exists,” she said. “What is important is the approach we have taken of consistently and repeatedly saying that hate crime is completely unacceptable, and that the outcome of the referendum was not a vote to become inward-looking and to stop being an open and tolerant nation. We will continue to champion those values and stand up for them.” Joanna Mludzinska, a Polish community leader, warned last week that a “wave” of hate crimes against European migrants could follow the start of Britain’s exit from the EU. The chair of the Polish Social and Cultural Association told MPs on the Commons home affairs committee that triggering article 50 could act as a “flashpoint” for new xenophobic attacks. Mludzinska said: “Where those people who for whatever reason thought everything would be resolved by Brexit find that doesn’t miraculously happen ... there might be another wave of response... ‘Why aren’t we getting what we wanted, and why are they still here?’” At the hearing, Yvette Cooper, the committee’s chair, said details of hate crime incidents heard by her committee were appalling. “Hate crime is appalling, un-British and should have no place in our country,” she said.",The Guardian,1

The speech was followed by a background briefing by an aide who suggested firms could be required to publish lists of foreign workers.

His complaint was dealt with by West Midlands police as the Tory conference took place in Birmingham.  National police reporting rules introduced in 2014 and endorsed by Rudd herself require all complaints of hate crime incidents to be recorded “regardless of whether or not those making the complaint are the victim and irrespective of whether or not there is any evidence to identify the hate crime incident”. West Midlands police have now written to the professor saying they have concluded an assessment of his complaint and they will not be investigating Rudd’s speech as a hate crime. “The matter has been recorded in line with the National Police Chiefs’ Council manual as a non-crime hate incident,” the force told the professor. A Home Office spokesperson said: “This was not a hate crime. The home secretary has been crystal clear that hatred has absolutely no place in a Britain that works for everyone. She’s made countering hate one of her key priorities; indeed, one of the first public interventions she made was to launch the hate crime action plan.” The policy of blanket recording of all complaints of hate crime incidents was drawn up by the College of Policing in 2014 with the justification that increased reporting would help police to tackle hate crime more effectively.",The Guardian,1

Police figures show reports of hate crime rose by 46% in the immediate aftermath of the vote last June and a second spike occurred in the last week of July, before incidences settled back to a weekly level 16% above those seen in 2015. Community leaders say complaints to the police receive a mixed response and some schools turn a blind eye to incidents on their premises. Joanna Mludzinska, chair of the Polish Social and Cultural Association, told MPs of her shock when her west London cultural centre was covered in graffiti, and said only a government guarantee on the post-Brexit status of the 3 million EU nationals in Britain would give them the confidence to reply to such attacks. Tadeusz Stenzel, the chair of trustees at the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, said of those responsible for the attacks: “They feel there is a less of a brake on them and they think if the people involved are migrants it is not a racist situation.” Drozdowicz said her resource centre had experienced an “explosion of calls” since the referendum result. She said there were incidents of teams of Polish construction workers being told to “go home”. A mother with a child in a buggy in the street had been told to “take your Polish bastard back home”. In a secondary school in west London, teachers had seen a Polish boy being beaten and had failed to respond. When his mother had complained to the school she was told that if he had been black it would have been treated as a racist incident. Drozdowicz said not all police forces were ready to respond to those who wanted to report hate crime. “They are sometimes waved away as employment issues about discrimination. Others are told that if they do not speak fluent English they are partially to blame for what happened,” she said. Drozdowicz said the pace of change had been too much for some communities, and people were turning on their neighbours. She said integration policies were not yet in place to help them respond, with east European communities often regarded as a problem rather than an asset. She stressed that hate crime victims were more likely to be poor east Europeans who were working in low-skilled jobs rather than middle-class professionals such as doctors, managers and lawyers. Yvette Cooper, the committee’s chair, said the details of hate crime incidents they had heard were appalling. “Hate crime is appalling, unBritish and should have no place in our country,” she said.",The Guardian,1
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/09/man-who-made-antisemitic-death-threats-to-mp-admits-further-charges,"A man who made antisemitic death threats to a Labour MP has admitted further charges after sending abusive messages on Twitter. John Nimmo, 28, from South Shields, sent two emails to Luciana Berger in which he said she would “get it like Jo Cox” and “watch your back Jewish scum”. The second message to the MP for Liverpool Wavertree included a picture of a large knife and came just three weeks after MP Jo Cox was killed. In a separate incident he also admitted sending offensive emails to an anti-hate crime organisation including threatening to blow up a mosque. Newcastle crown court heard the three further charges related to tweets he sent that included messaging someone saying, “watch your back you Jewish inbred you’re dead meat, National Action”. Berger, the former shadow minister for mental health, said the messages had caused her “great fear and anguish”. She said the incident had left her in a state of “huge distress” and “it caused me to feel physically sick being threatened in such a way”. “I was extremely concerned for my safety and I felt completely under threat. I had previously received antisemitic messages and threats but the reference to Jo Cox was terrifying,” she said. “The biggest concern was not knowing who this was, for all I knew the offender could have resided next door to me.” Nimmo was jailed in 2014 for eight weeks for sending abusive messages on Twitter to feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez and MP Stella Creasy. It came after Criado-Perez led a campaign using social media for a female figure to appear on a Bank of England note. It included Nimmo telling Criado-Perez to “shut up” and made references to rape followed by: “I will find you (smiley face)”. Nimmo was remanded in custody and told he would be sentenced for all three cases on 10 February.",The Guardian,1
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/07/poles-lin-uk-scared-to-speak-up-on-hate-crimes,"Poles living in Britain are so anxious about their right to remain after Brexit that they are failing to report hate crimes, according to the head of the Polish Social and Cultural Association. Joanna Młudzińska, who will give evidence on Tuesday to a home affairs select committee inquiry on the issue, said EU nationals felt so disenfranchised at being used as “pawns” in Brexit negotiations that they were opting to keep a low profile, rather than contact the authorities. The situation has become so acute that the London-based East European Resource Centre (EERC) is launching a pilot scheme to encourage EU nationals to report hate crimes. Młudzińska, who was born in London to Polish parents, said the government’s failure to clarify the standing of the UK’s 2.9 million EU citizens was “immoral” and was putting Polish and other EU migrants living in Britain in an impossible position. “Very few people are reporting hate crimes at the moment. People are very scared, because often this occurs in the workplace and they are scared they might lose their job. Or it’s from a neighbour and they don’t want to cause more problems.” Młudzińska added: “They can’t turn around and say: ‘No, I don’t have to go home because your government has said I am allowed to stay.’ That puts you in a weaker position, doesn’t it? It makes people vulnerable. It makes them scared to stand up for themselves, to properly report things.” Last year the number of Polish-born UK residents was estimated at 831,000, making Poles the largest overseas-born group in the country and Polish the second most spoken language in England. Various agencies have documented that incidents of hate crime soared in the aftermath of June’s EU referendum vote. On Friday, a 15-year-old boy appeared in Chelmsford youth court charged with the manslaughter of a Polish man who was attacked in Essex weeks after the UK voted to leave the EU. The death of Arkadiusz Jóźwik, 40, in Harlow was initially reported as a possible hate crime, becoming one of the most high-profile incidents of violence linked to the result of the EU referendum, although it is understood that prosecutors are not treating it as such. A number of sources recorded an increase in hate crime in the wake of the Brexit vote. Racist or religious abuse incidents recorded by police in England and Wales jumped 41% with 5,468 such crimes being logged in the month after the UK voted to quit the EU, according to the Home Office. The uncertainty facing EU nationals living in Britain has been highlighted by a series of cases, including that of Dom Wolf, born in London to German parents, who told the Guardian on Thursday that he could not get a British passport unless he took a UK citizenship test because he could not prove his mother had been in England legally when she gave birth to him. The 32-year-old said he felt betrayed by the country in which he was born. His parents arrived in 1974, when his mother worked for the University of London as a lecturer and his father was self-employed. Other examples include Monique Hawkins, a Dutch woman who has lived in the UK for 24 years and has two children with her British husband, but has been told by the Home Office that she should make arrangements to leave the country after applying for citizenship. Professor Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics at the University of Kent, said that, despite the apparent rise in hate crimes following the referendum, there were inherent difficulties in quantifying the issue. “The police measures for recording hate crime and how it is categorised have only recently become more sophisticated, so we’re not really able to say whether things are actually getting worse or better,” he said. “Historically, it’s been an area where we haven’t really invested much.” Goodwin, who will also appear before the select committee hearing, said that monitoring the far right was problematic because easily identifiable organisations, such as the EDL and BNP, had fractured into small, disparate factions. “This has made it harder for researchers, as well as the security services, to keep on top. There are 20 tiny groups and it’s quite difficult to know what they are doing and how,” he said.",The Guardian,1

Not so the procedure for reacting to a dramatic erosion in the social glue. There is little by way of leadership from No 10. Nothing from the communities secretary to suggest his title is anything other than honorific. There was a statement from Robert Buckland, the solicitor general, declaring saying that levels of hate crimes – 2,778 incidents between 5 and 18 August – had declined to 2015 levels. Some reassurance. In the year to 2015, hate crimes, at 52,000 offences, had jumped more than a fifth.

All the more so because this acridity is not a given. We’re cranky now, with the handbrake off and inhibitions released, but at times more tense and fearful in our history we have been more willing to show kindness to people of difference. We have been better than this.     Wartime Britain and black GIs united through music | Letters           Read more       Recently published in the UK is Forgotten: The Untold Story of D-Day’s Black Heroes, first released in the US, about the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion, an 800-strong unit of black American soldiers whose contribution to the D-day landings had all but been erased from history. After landing on the beaches, they deployed armed balloons and deterred enemy aircraft – a task for which they largely prepared over seven months in the British countryside, having docked in the north of Scotland. Before the arrival of the Empire Windrush and the advent of mass immigration, there was an influx of foreigners at a speed and on a scale to give Nigel Farage a coronary. They were soldiers during wartime, so of course they were met with gratitude, you might say; but the point is more specific for in the era of savagely enforced segregation in the US, white GIs showed a brutal and racist disdain for black GIs posted alongside them in Britain. And the British government, to curry favour with white, predominantly southern soldiers – and a like-minded US military establishment – offered the black GIs scant protection. Author Linda Hervieux located 12 of them, and the most striking thing they recall is the extraordinary extent to which ordinary British people – themselves deprived in a time of penury and rations – were their tigerish supporters, protectors and cheerleaders.        When white GIs objected to black GIs at a village dance, they themselves were ordered to leave        Ollie Stewart, a black American journalist, who reported on the deployment of 1,300 black soldiers to Britain, noted: “The English people show our lads every possible courtesy and some of them, accustomed to ill-will, harsh words and artificial barriers, seem slightly bewildered. They never had a chance to leave their southern homes before and never realised there was a part of the world which was willing to forget a man’s colour and welcome him as a brother.” Arthur Guest, a member of the battalion, recalled: “It was a spark of light. A different way of living.” Hervieux records their billeting in places such as Checkendon, Oxfordshire, Pontypool and Chepstow. “Working-class people in the Welsh villages shared their meagre rations and the yield of their small kitchen gardens. Here they were Americans first.” Compare and contrast. A few weeks ago, I spoke to a Romanian, a driver, who said he has become wary of asking for directions because of abuse triggered by his accent. And the worst place for that in his recent experience? Genteel Tunbridge Wells. We can compare the arrogance of those who bully and smear foreigners now with those who did so years ago; with the white GIs who spread rumours that some of the black soldiers – even the college educated – could only bark and many had tails. We can compare the indolence of our government now with that of Churchill back then. We don’t “want to see lynching begin in England”, noted an aide to Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary. But when Churchill was told of a black GI being hounded from a restaurant by white colleagues, he suggested the soldier acquire a banjo and seek entry as a member of the band.     National anti-hate crime campaign to launch after spike in incidents           Read more       Ordinary people, however, saw things differently. When a vicar’s wife from Somerset urged separatism, she was castigated. “There is and will be no persecution of coloured people in Britain,” thundered the Sunday Pictorial. When white GIs objected to black GIs at a village dance, they themselves were ordered to leave. To drive home the point, local people taunted the expelled GIs by buying the their black guests drinks. George Orwell, as ever, reflected the grassroots mood. “The general consensus of opinion seems to be that the only American soldiers with any manners are the Negroes,” he wrote in Tribune. Of course, the comparison is inexact. There is a difference between an influx of soldiers deployed during wartime and the modern examples of difference: Britons who look, speak and dress differently, economic migrants whose presence undoubtedly has an impact on schools, hospitals, jobs and housing. Those who bully and abuse can seek to justify their behaviour by pointing to the stresses that we know exist. Still there is something to be gleaned from the experience of the black battalion. They were not “othered” as dehumanised symbols, even when their presence caused debate and tension. They were seen as flesh and blood individuals. Jessie Prior, a Welsh woman who had never seen a non-white person before, sent a letter to New Jersey, to the mother of a black GI her family had befriended. “While he is here, we shall take every care of him,” she said. “We look upon him now as our own.” There are modern versions of her in every community. We should be proud of them, but it’s those who preach division who hog the limelight. With every racist act, every catcall, every rancid tweet, they betray Prior and all like her who once set a higher standard. We have been better than this, and can be again.",The Guardian,1
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/19/new-antisemitism-definition-is-justified,"I was shocked by the letter (17 December) from Tony Greenstein and others about the government adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism. The letter said: “The new definition has nothing to do with opposing antisemitism, it is merely designed to silence public debate on Israel’s crimes against the Palestinians. Antisemitic incidents comprise about 2% of all hate crime. Why then the concentration on antisemitism and not on Islamophobia, which is far more widespread?” Those assertions are all either misleading or false and seem to say that antisemitism in Britain doesn’t matter. It is true that religiously based hate crime represents a very small percentage of all hate crime. In 2015 out of about 66,000 hate crimes in the UK, about 5,000 were on grounds of religion and, of those, about 1,000 attacks each were antisemitic and Islamophobic. Both types of attack are as abhorrent as each other. The British Jewish population is less than 10% of the size of the British Muslim population, so the Jewish community is facing far more frequent racist attacks pro rata than the Muslim community. In fact, the attacks on the Jewish community are concentrated on those who are easily identified as being Jewish, including those going to or from Jewish community centres, events or synagogues. Secular Jews are frequently unaware of such attacks. The new definition of antisemitism that the government has adopted specifically states that “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic”. It does, however, define “applying double standards by requiring of it a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation” as antisemitic. Is that what they want to do? There is nothing in the new definition that would stifle legitimate criticism of Israel. When unjustified criticism of Israel is published in the media, such as the false report of a massacre in Jenin, antisemitic attacks in the UK increase, so this new definition is needed. Islamophobia does not increase in response to reports of the Israel-Palestine dispute. It does increase in response to reports of jihadi attacks in the west. That is also unfair on Muslims in Britain who are strongly opposed to terrorism. But it is no reason to make light of antisemitism in Britain.Stephen FranklinLondon • Deplorable though the Netanyahu government’s settlement policy is, the description by the usual pro-BDS suspects of Israel as “an apartheid state” is ludicrous. This is a country whose minority Arab citizens have, and exercise, the vote, are represented in the Knesset, local government, the judiciary, academia and the press, and whose religion, whether Muslim or Christian, is freely practised. That is not to say more does not need to be done to enhance provision for Israel’s Arab citizens, especially the Bedouin, but it would be a welcome change if those who constantly denounce Israel for failings real, exaggerated or imagined spent a fraction of their energy protesting about the slaughter in Syria, many of whose citizens are being treated in Israeli hospitals, or the actions of Hamas and Hezbollah.Jeremy BeechamLabour, House of Lords • My question to the letter’s signatories is simple: how many of you have actually visited Israel? If you have had any kind of in-depth visit to Israel, you must have noticed how many Arabs study at its universities. How many of the doctors and teachers are Arab. How many checkout staff in the supermarkets are Arab, working side by side with Israelis. Do you see separate seating on buses and in public places for Arabs and non-Arabs? No. That is what apartheid was, and it is not practised in any shape or form in Israel.Ann LevinRa’anana, Israel • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters",The Guardian,1
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/17/german-officials-say-facebook-is-doing-too-little-to-stop-hate-speech,"Germany is to consider new laws that would force social media platforms such as Facebook and search engines such as Google to take a more active role in policing illegal hate speech on their sites. Measures considered by Angela Merkel’s coalition government include forcing companies to set up clear channels for registering complaints, to publish the number of complaints they receive and to hire legally qualified ombudsmen to carry out deletions.     Facebook's plan to tackle fake news raises questions over limitations           Read more       Online platforms that fail meet such legal requirements could be hit with fines calculated on the basis of their global annual turnover, or face on-the-spot fines of up to €500,000 if they neglect to remove posts in breach of German hate speech law within 24 hours. Concerns over social media’s power to fire up populist narratives and boost conspiracy theories has increased after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump’s shock election in November, with politicians across Europe looking anxiously ahead to elections in France and Germany next year. In Germany, which has some of the toughest laws around hate speech – including prison sentences for Holocaust denial and inciting hatred against minorities – political frustration with tech companies’ refusal to take responsibility for content posted on their sites has increased markedly in recent months. A hate speech taskforce including representatives from Google, Facebook and Twitter, set up by German justice minister Heiko Maas in autumn 2015, vowed to aim to delete illegal postings within 24 hours. But a government report published in late September this year found that tech companies were still struggling to react adequately to breaches of law, with Facebook only deleting 46%, YouTube 10% and Twitter 1% of illegal content flagged up by normal, non-privileged users. According to a investigation by Süddeutsche Zeitung, Facebook currently employs about 600 people via the service provider Arvato to each carry out 2,000 deletions per day on its German-language accounts. But German officials say they have received no such information from the tech companies themselves. If another report due at the start of next year showed no further improvement, the German government would take steps towards sanctioning companies, Maas told The Observer. “We are already looking in detail at how we can make providers of online platforms criminally liable for undeleted content that breaks German law. Of course, if other measures don’t work we also need to think about fines. That would be a strong incentive for quick action.” While German law currently sets an upper limit of €10 million for the amount companies can be fined for criminal offences, the justice ministry is independently looking into whether fines in the future can be calculated on the basis of a company’s global annual turnover. “We urgently need more transparency,” said Maas, a member of the centre-left Social Democratic party. “We could imagine obliging social networks to publish at regular intervals how many complaints they have received about illegal hate speech and how they dealt with them. That way it would be visible for everyone how many complaints there are and how many deletions. That too would increase the pressure on Facebook, Twitter, Google and others. “Companies that make money with their social networks have social obligations – it cannot be in any company’s interest that their platform is used to commit crimes”, he said. While the debate in Germany has mostly focused on postings on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, such law changes would also have wide-ranging consequences for the Google search engine. Last Sunday, an Observer article pointed out that the top Google search result for the question “Did the Holocaust happen” linked to an article on a neo-Nazi website. While typing the same question in German into German Google does not yield this link, the first page of results still includes links to Holocaust-denial articles. According to Christian Solmecke, a Cologne lawyer specialising in hate-speech offences, such statements are “unequivocally” covered by section 130, paragraph 3 of the German criminal code, which states that “whosoever publicly or in a meeting approves of, denies or downplays an act committed under the rule of National Socialism [...] in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding five years or a fine.” While Google does not have to seek out illegal content out of its own accord, it has to react to any complaint, whether by deletion or by blocking access, Solmecke said: “According to German law, a complaint would immediately oblige Google to delete such content and avoid a future repeat of such a violation”. Unlike the three social media sites at the heart of the German government’s current investigation – Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned Youtube – the search engine itself does not offer a prominently displayed channel for lodging complaints, such as Facebook’s abuse button. A “send feedback” window at the bottom of Google’s search page allows ordinary users to message the search engine, but since there is no separate field for contact details, the process is a one-way street. The Guardian used the feedback box to Google about a link to a website by Ursula Haverbeck – a prominent German holocaust denier who has been repeatedly sent to prison under the incitement of hatred law – but the website was still listed as one of the engine’s top search results 24 hours later. Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called on Google and other tech companies to take a more active role in stopping the spread of hate speech online. “Websites that deny the Holocaust, stoke antisemitism and resentments against minorities, or spread other inhuman messages, are completely unacceptable”, Schuster said.",The Guardian,1
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/29/nhs-nurses-pay-cut-12-per-cent-over-decade,"NHS workers will have had their pay cut by 12% by the end of the decade because of a government-imposed wage restraint that is now exacerbating chronic understaffing, new research reveals. The 625,000 health service staff who earn at least £22,000 will have seen their income fall by 12% between 2010-11 and 2020-21 as a result of years of below-inflation 0% and 1% pay rises eroding their spending power, according to a report by the Health Foundation thinktank The real-terms drop in pay will hit NHS personnel across the UK who are on band five or above in the service’s pay scales, which includes all 315,000 nurses. The Royal College of Nursing’s 270,000 members are currently being polled on whether they should strike – for the first time in their history – in protest at the government holding down their pay by limiting rises to 1% every year until 2020. Staff salaries have already been cut by 6% since the coalition came to power in 2010, more than the 2% seen across the economy as a whole in that time, the report found. Midwives have seen their pay shrink by 6%, but doctors and health visitors have been hit by 8% and 12% drops respectively. The Health Foundation also found that England could face a shortfall of 42,000 nurses by 2020, and almost half of all nurses believe that current staffing levels are already dangerously stretched. Staff pay has fallen back so much that it is now causing major problems, the thinktank said. “The current phase of national NHS pay bill control began at a time of economic recession, with low inflation and high unemployment. However, this is increasingly being replaced by greater numbers of staff shortages and the likelihood of higher inflation.” It adds: “Having contained NHS staff earnings growth in recent years, UK governments now face a situation where recent trends and future projections highlight that earnings in the broader economy are growing more rapidly, and inflation is at a level that will erode the purchasing power of NHS staff.”                                Facebook        Twitter        Pinterest         Thousands of nurses are projected to leave the profession. Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Observer   NHS pay caps have gone as far as they can, but are no longer sustainable and should be replaced, argued the thinktank: “The need for staffing growth, internal skills shortages, the search for productivity improvements, the ageing of the NHS workforce, and external labour market changes and unknowns – for example, the impact of Brexit on NHS staffing – all point to the need to better align the total reward package of NHS staff with organisational priorities.” The likelihood of inflation being around 2-3% and workers generally receiving 3% pay rises means NHS staff’s earnings will continue to decline, the thinktank believes. “This means that NHS pay is likely to continue to reduce relative to both inflation and the wider economy over the period. Health unions said the findings vindicated their warnings that wage control had been applied for so long that it was prompting staff to quit and potential recruits to choose to pursue other careers. “Nurses should not have to fund the NHS deficit from their own pay packets. Every year that the government holds NHS pay below inflation, hundreds of thousands of nurses get another real-terms cut to their salary. Too many are struggling to make ends meet, turning to food banks and hardship grants in desperation,” said Janet Davies, the RCN’s chief executive and general secretary. The government pay cap is fuelling a recruitment and retention crisis that is also damaging patient care, she said. “A growing number feel they can no longer afford to work in the profession and others are deterred from joining by the meagre pay on offer.” She called on Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, to scrap the 1% pay cap that the government has already said it intends to impose on public-sector workers until 2020. The NHS has about 25,000 nursing vacancies lying unfilled across the UK, especially in hospitals, the RCN estimates.     Brexit could make NHS shortage of nurses worse, says report           Read more       Anita Charlesworth, director of research and economics at the Health Foundation, said: “By 2019, people working for the NHS will have had their pay capped for nine consecutive years. The result is that earnings will have fallen by at least 12% over a decade when accounting for inflation. The NHS doesn’t have enough nurses and is struggling to retain staff. As earnings across the economy pick up, the government can’t continue to hold down pay indefinitely and secure the workforce the NHS needs.” The Conservatives dismissed the findings. “We disagree with these figures. They speculate on future pay awards, which are based on independent recommendations. Investment in our NHS, in additional staff and indeed in their overall pay is founded on the strong economy only Theresa May and the Conservatives can provide,” a party spokesman said.",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/29/theresa-may-campaign-event-in-scottish-forest-prompts-new-claims-she-is-hiding,"Theresa May has fuelled accusations from Labour she has been “hiding from the public” during the general election campaign after she held her latest rally in a tiny community hall in Aberdeenshire with such poor phone reception that live coverage of the event was impossible. About 200 Conservative campaigners crammed into Crathes hall, Banchory, a tin-roofed single-storey building at the heart of a swath of woodland in rural north-east Scotland, from where journalists were unable to tweet or broadcast. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, was quick to make political capital of the event on Twitter:    John McDonnell MP  (@johnmcdonnellMP) Been out all day on the campaign trail in Mansfield. Can someone please explain to me why our Prime Minister is hiding in a forest? https://t.co/Yj5bscvn6x  April 29, 2017   The prime minister has come under fire in recent days for supposedly dodging any chance of unscripted encounters with members of the public. After she delivered a speech in a community centre in Leeds to a select group of supporters rather than the users of the building on Friday, Jeremy Corbyn accused her of hiding from the public. “She won’t take part in TV debates and she won’t talk to voters,” Corbyn said. “Refusing to debate Labour in this election isn’t a sign of strength, it’s a sign of weakness. What is she afraid of? Voters deserve to know what political parties are offering.” When journalists were eventually able to report on May’s speech it emerged she had told her supporters that she was the only leader capable of providing “strong and stable leadership” for Britain as the country headed towards Brexit. “At this election, people will have a clear choice between five years of strong and stable leadership with me and my team or a coalition of chaos led by Jeremy Corbyn,” she said. “That’s what’s on offer of course, if you look at the other parties, they’re lining up to prop up Jeremy Corbyn. We see it from the Liberal Democrats and we see it from Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists.” Aberdeenshire was one of the most strongly pro-union regions of Scotland in the independence referendum with a yes vote of more than 60%. Reminding her supporters of the potential of another independence vote in the near future, she said: “There is only one party that is committed to the union. There is only one candidate for prime minister who will stand up to defend the United Kingdom.” May said she would strengthen the union by “standing up against the separatists who want to break up our country”.  Asking voters in Scotland to back her vision for a post-Brexit Britain she said: “Give me the mandate to lead Britain, give me the mandate to speak for Britain, give me the mandate to fight for Britain and give me the mandate to deliver for Britain. “My message to the people of Scotland is clear: every vote for me and my team will strengthen my hand in the Brexit negotiations. That will strengthen the union, strengthen the economy, and the UK and Scotland together will flourish because if Scotland is flourishing the rest of the United Kingdom is flourishing too.”  A Conservative source said May also did door-knocking and visited a business for a roundtable in Aberdeenshire, and campaigned in Maidenhead where she met voters on the high street. “The PM has visited cities, large and small towns and today she visited a rural community,” the source said. “She has been in the three nations of Great Britain since the start of the campaign.

Budget cuts, changes to exams, problems recruiting teachers and Brexit are causing major upheaval, according to the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT).      'Schools are in jeopardy': teachers renew funding plea in run-up to polls           Read more       The union is also expected to argue against government proposals to expand grammar schools at its annual conference this weekend.  Speaking ahead of the Telford meeting, the NAHT general secretary, Russell Hobby, said: “The combination of challenges facing secondary schools and their students has never been greater.  “Many school leaders are concerned about maintaining high standards in the face of simultaneous upheaval on so many fronts. It’s a perfect storm. The government is loading more uncertainty onto the secondary system than ever before. There is a real risk it will break.” Hobby repeated warnings that schools are facing “unacceptable levels of financial pressure”, with an NAHT survey showing that 72% of headteachers believe that school budgets will be unsustainable in two years’ time.  “This is a result of the government’s choice to freeze spending and keep it at 2010 levels for each pupil. The 2010 cash isn’t going as far as it used to. You can’t expect it to. But the government is flatly refusing to admit the reality.”      Crammed in like sardines? Share your experiences of school class sizes           Read more       Ministers have argued that school funding is at record levels, and that this will increase further as pupil numbers rise. The outgoing NAHT president, Kim Johnson, attacked suggestions that schools need to make efficiency savings. “It’s quite insulting to have ministers say to you: ‘You need to renegotiate your photocopying contract, perhaps think about the paper you’re getting in, club together with six other schools and you’ll get it cheaper.’”  Schools are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain staff, the NAHT said, particularly in key subjects such as maths, science and languages. “Year after year, the government has missed its own targets for teacher recruitment,” Hobby said. “Thirty per cent of new teachers leave the profession after five years.  “NAHT’s own research shows school leaders have struggled or failed to recruit in eight out of 10 cases this year. Recruitment has never been more challenging.” Schools are also dealing with exam changes this summer, including a new GCSE grading system. There are also concerns about a government expectation that 90% of pupils will study English Baccalaureate subjects – English, maths, science, history or geography and a language - narrowing the curriculum, the NAHT said, and uncertainty about how Brexit will affect the thousands of EU nationals who work in schools. The NAHT’s motion on selective schools says the union should “campaign vigorously to reject the proposed expansion of selection” in the absence of “any compelling evidence that it promotes social mobility”. Theresa May has said the policy will help to create a place at a good school for every child and argued that many children’s school choices are determined by where they live or their parents’ wealth.",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/29/eu-leaders-set-to-take-tough-stance-in-special-brexit-summit,"EU leaders have unanimously agreed tough negotiating guidelines for Brexit talks with the UK, suggesting they will demand that Britain agrees on payments to the bloc before considering a new trade deal. The heads of the remaining 27 EU countries agreed to adopt the draft guidelines issued by Donald Tusk last month less than 15 minutes into a special summit in Brussels on Saturday. The European council president tweeted that a “firm and fair political mandate” for the negotiations was now ready. A senior EU source said the leaders’ decision took only one minute of discussion.     Weak pound melts the British dream of a place in the sun           Read more       When the formal negotiations between the EU and the UK begin in June, the British government will be told it needs to resolve the key divorce issues of citizens’ rights, the estimated €60bn (£51bn) divorce bill and the Irish border before any talks on a future trade deal can begin. As he arrived at the summit earlier in the day, the French president, François Hollande, said: “There will inevitably be a price and a cost for Britain, it’s the choice they made. “We must not be punitive, but at the same time it’s clear that Europe knows how to defend its interests, and that Britain will have a less good position outside the EU than in the EU.” The comments were echoed by the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, who said there was no such thing as a “free Brexit”. Asked about the British prime minister’s claim that she will be strengthened by an election victory, Hollande, who is now in his last week as president, said: “That is an election argument that I can understand, but this is not an argument against the European Union. Why? Because the bases, the principles, the objectives are already fixed. These will be the lines that will be chosen by the negotiators and there will be no others.” Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, also ruled out the idea of Theresa May gaining any advantage from an election win. “It’s an internal problem she wants to resolve in the Conservative party, to have not a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit, but Theresa’s Brexit,” he said. “We are very united. You seem surprised, but it’s a fact.” The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it was in Britain’s interests for the EU to be unified, as it would boost the chances of a deal.     EU leaders to insist UK pays its Brexit bills as precursor to trade talks           Read more       “This extraordinary meeting shows the unity of the 27 on a clear line, but this unity is not directed against Britain, I think that it is also in its interest,” he said. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said that only once there was sufficient trust between the EU nations and Britain on the core issues could both sides proceed to discuss future relations. Rutte, who stressed the importance of Britain to the Dutch economy, told reporters that “as you get to a certain level, as far as possible, and say now we are confident about this, then we have to swiftly start talking about the future relationships trade and also politics”. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had earlier in the week accused some in the UK of being deluded about the consequences of leaving the EU, but offered a softer tone in Brussels. “We want to have good relations with Great Britain in the future, but we want to represent our interests as the 27. So far this has been a real success,” she said. “We will hold the negotiations on separation first and then at a certain point when the substantive points in the separation negotations we will come to a point when we can talk about the future. “The separation negotiations on the rights of citizens of our states in the UK and of UK citizens in the EU. Also financial questions are part of the separation questions.” There is some pessimism in Brussels about the prospect of a deal being struck over the next two years, though some EU officials have taken heart from the fact that May has not recently repeated her claim that “no deal is better than a bad deal” despite being pushed to do so by politicians in favour of a hard Brexit. “We are convinced that no deal is in no one’s interest. We appreciate the fact that the tone of the debate in the UK on this issue has changed,” said a senior EU official on Friday. Asked, however, to respond to May’s claims on the general election campaign trail that member states were preparing to “line up to oppose us”, one senior EU diplomat said: “She’s right. She should not underestimate the commitment to unity.” Key negotiating points for the EU27 1. There will be no “cherry picking” of the four core single market freedoms, which are “indivisible”. This rules out government’s hope of keeping “elements of a single market” without free movement of people. 2. The 27 countries will negotiate with Britain as a unified block, relying on the principle that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”. No individual countries will be allowed backchannel chats on future trade deals while the transition is still being talked through. 3. There should be a phased approach to Britain’s withdrawal. The first phase will set out to “avoid disruption” from an “abrupt change”, and the main priority will be to give certainty to EU citizens about their legal status. Once that is decided, the European council will give the go ahead for next phase of withdrawal, which would involve working out a framework for the future relationship. 4. Citizens’ rights will be the “first priority of the negotiations”. The rights of EU and UK citizens will be protected when the UK formally leaves, which at this point looks as if it will be around March 2019. This means that any EU national who has been living in the UK for five years by that point will be protected. 5. “Flexible and imaginative solutions” will be sought to the thorny issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which has been fluid since the Good Friday agreement. Negotiations will aim to avoid establishing a hard border, which it is feared could trigger a return to violence. 6. No final figure for the divorce has been given, but the bloc will pursue one “single financial settlement”, meaning the UK will continue budget payments until 2020.",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/29/joanna-lumley-attacks-sadiq-khans-scrapping-of-thames-garden-bridge,"The doomed plan for a garden bridge across the Thames has been defended by one of the project’s strongest proponents, the actor Joanna Lumley. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, effectively pulled the plug on the controversial plan on Friday, announcing that he would not provide the vital financial guarantees needed for construction to begin.     The garden bridge is dead – now £37m of public money must be repaid           Read more       The Garden Bridge Trust, which is responsible for realising Thomas Heatherwick’s design, vowed to fight on despite Khan’s decision, pinning its hopes on persuading another public body, such as the Department for Transport, to step in as guarantor. Lumley, who is well known as Patsy in BBC sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, originally devised the proposal for a garden over the Thames featuring hundreds of trees and thousands of other plants, winning support from Boris Johnson, Khan’s predecessor as mayor and the then chancellor, George Osborne. Speaking to the Times newspaper, Lumley said Khan’s decision to remove financial backing was “absolutely shattering, devastating”. “The negativity troubles me in my heart. I hope we’re not turning into the sort of country that instantly says no before it considers saying yes,” she said. “A nation that just pulls the shutters down. The silent majority still love the bridge, but of course they were not asked what they think.” Osborne committed £60m of public funding to the scheme when he was in office. The Department for Transport has already given £30m and Transport for London contributed £30m, £20m of which structured as a loan.

Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA   In a study of the project commissioned by city hall, the Labour MP Margaret Hodge found the bridge was likely to cost more than £200m, and that £37.4m of public funds had already been spent without any building work taking place. Lumley told the Times the project had been politicised. “There was so much negativity about this £60m of public money,” she said. “All we heard was £60m, £60m, £60m. But . . . it’ll work out at about 32p a person in the UK. It’s not as if we’re stealing bread from people.” In a letter to Lord Davies, the Labour life peer and former government minister who chairs the trust, Khan said the cash had been spent before final land agreements had been sealed. Khan wrote: “It is concerning that a huge amount of effort and expenditure has been expended on other aspects of the project when there is a real possibility that agreement will not be reached before the expiry of planning permission, or at all.” Responding to Khan’s decision, Davies said the trust had received the letter with great regret. “We will study the contents of the letter in detail before responding formally. The Garden Bridge Trust was set up at the request of Transport for London and the Department of Transport to deliver the project which had received public money,” he said. “We have had enormous support from our funders and are very confident we can raise the remaining funds required. But sadly, the mayor of London has taken a different decision to those in place when the project started.”",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/29/hundreds-of-private-patients-seek-compensation-from-rogue-surgeon,"Hundreds of private patients of a surgeon convicted of carrying out needless breast operations are seeking compensation after nearly £18m worth of claims were made against the NHS. Ian Paterson, 59, was convicted on Friday of 17 counts of wounding with intent and three counts of unlawful wounding against 10 patients, upon whom he conducted “extensive, life-changing operations for no medically justifiable reason”. More than 250 NHS patients have received payouts, and it has now emerged that around 350 patients who underwent treatment at private Spire Healthcare clinics in the West Midlands are also taking civil action against Paterson and the firm. Paterson, described in court by one victim as being “like God”, lied to patients and exaggerated or invented the risk of cancer to convince them to go under his knife. Thompsons Solicitors, a firm representing the private patients, said Spire Healthcare’s treatment of those who complained had been shabby. “We are determined to secure appropriate compensation for every single one of our clients, some of whom found the courage to come forward only as recently as four weeks ago,” said Linda Millband, the lead national lawyer at the firm. “Spire needs to face up to its responsibilities, because they let him operate well after he was suspended by the NHS.” A freedom of information request revealed the NHS had resolved 256 cases, paying out £9.5m in compensation and £8.2m in costs. Another 25 cases are still to be heard. Paterson was suspended by the General Medical Council in 2011. He sobbed as the jury returned the guilty verdicts at Nottingham crown court. He was released on conditional bail ahead of sentencing in May, when he faces a custodial sentence.  One patient who gave evidence in the trial had 27 biopsy cores taken from her healthy right breast and had “absolutely not” received medical best practice. A Spire Healthcare spokesman said: “What Mr Paterson did in our hospitals, in other private hospitals and in the NHS, absolutely should not have happened and today justice has been done. “We would like to reiterate how truly sorry we are for the distress experienced by any patients affected by this case. We can say unequivocally that we have learned the lessons from these events. “We commissioned a thorough independent investigation and have fully implemented all of the recommendations.”",The Guardian,0

Don’t insult gorillas by comparing them to Donald Trump | Ros Coward           Read more       Tom Harrison, who goes by the name Mr Gorilla, is raising money for the Gorilla Organisation. The 41-year-old Londoner started at 10.34am on Sunday and crossed the finish line at 11.45am on Saturday.  He has slept at friends’ houses in the evenings after completing about 10 to 12 hours and 4.5 miles per day and has swapped between crawling on hands and knees and up on hands and feet to save his blistered knees.  Harrison crossed the finish line on the Mall flanked by his two sons and beating his chest. He said: “It was tough at points, but I am really glad I did it.”  The Putney-based police officer said he had run the marathon in the gorilla suit last year, but this time wanted to do “that little bit more”. He said: “The first couple of days, people were giving me weird looks and a wide berth. But by day three more people had started hearing about it: I started getting people beeping their horns and clapping and cheering.” On his unique view of the capital over the past seven days, he said: “One thing I noticed was that being at exhaust height, it was really catching my throat.

I had helpers in front of me telling me to go left, right and so on so that I didn’t hit lamp-posts or trees.”  Harrison said he was most looking forward to getting a massage for his aching shoulders, and having a cup of coffee, as it had upset his stomach during the race. “Your stomach is not used to being in that position, so it gave me a bit of heartburn,” he said.  He was met at the finish line by Gorilla Organisation chair Ian Redmond and conservationist Bill Oddie, who handed him a trophy and a stuffed gorilla.  The Gorilla Organisation is dedicated to conserving gorillas in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Harrison’s JustGiving page for his marathon effort has so far raised more than £23,000 for the charity.  In his costume, the police officer has taken part in a series of fundraisers for the cause, including the Great Gorilla Run, Tough Mudder and running the same marathon last year.  “He’s just this incredible personality who seems to me to be absolutely fearless, but he loves the gorillas.” said Jillian Miller, the charity’s director. “I thought he was mad at first, but you know when Tom sets his heart to do something, he absolutely does it.”",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/29/theresa-may-remains-absolutely-commited-to-hs2-rail-link,"Theresa May has committed to delivering the HS2 high-speed rail link. The prime minister was reportedly coming under pressure from Tory MPs in the south to cancel HS2, which the government projects will cost £55.7bn. Her announcement ends speculation that she was preparing to drop the new north-south railway from the Conservatives’ general election manifesto.  In an interview with the Yorkshire Post, May said: “We remain absolutely committed to HS2. It is a very important infrastructure project for the country. It is important that we increase capacity on this mainline and I believe that HS2 is the right way to do that.  “I’m very keen that we do have a country that works for everyone, and that means every part of the country, and that’s why we’ve introduced the modern industrial strategy, we’ve consulted on that and had very good and positive constructive response from business on that.  “Because we want to ensure that in every part of the country we are identifying the benefits they have, the types of economic development that are best suited. How can we encourage that?  “Infrastructure development is a hugely important part of that, it’s why in the autumn statement we were clear that we we’re putting extra money through to 2020 in infrastructure development.”  The first phase of HS2 is due to open in December 2026 and will see trains travel at high speed between London and Birmingham before running on from Birmingham on the existing west coast mainline. A second Y-shaped phase will open in two stages. Phase 2a from the West Midlands to Crewe will launch in 2027 and phase 2b, from Crewe to Manchester and from the West Midlands to Leeds, South Yorkshire and the East Midlands, will open in 2033. May was more cautious about fully committing to an “HS3” or “northern powerhouse” rail link. In the 2016 budget, the then chancellor George Osborne set aside £60m to develop plans to cut journey times to around 30 minutes between Leeds and Manchester, and to improve transport connections between other northern cities. The PM told the newspaper: “The issue is there are a number of options that are being looked at in relation to HS3 or northern powerhouse rail. But what I would say is those big projects are not the only way in which we are looking to invest in transport in the region.”",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/29/plans-for-british-spaceports-in-danger-of-being-grounded-by-poor-legislation,"Ambitious plans to launch satellites from spaceports in Britain are in danger of being grounded by poor legislation that leaves operators open to crippling insurance costs, MPs have warned. The government hopes to have satellites flown into orbit from UK spaceports by 2020, but a draft version of the spaceflight bill states that companies could face unlimited liability for any damages caused by falling space hardware.     Space race: eight sites shortlisted for UK's first commercial spaceport           Read more       The wording of the new bill appears to counter an amendment to the 1986 Outer Space Act made in 2015, which imposed a €60m cap on the amount that spaceflight companies are required to indemnify the government. “Lax wording in the bill leaves it open that an operator would have to indemnify the government against all losses and that makes it completely impractical,” said Stephen Metcalfe, chair of the cross-party science and technology committee. In a report published on Saturday, the committee calls for revisions to the bill to ensure that Britain’s ambitions in commercial spaceflight are not undermined. The MPs are also seeking clarification on whether a €60m cap on the insurance for missions would apply per launch or to individual satellites “For multiple satellite constellations where you might launch 20 small satellites at once, you couldn’t possibly expect someone to indemnify €60m for each of them,” Metcalfe said. The draft bill sets out the legal framework that will be needed for spaceport and satellite companies to gain a share of the commercial spaceflight market which is estimated to be worth £25bn over the next 20 years. On Friday, the UK Space Agency took bids for £10m of grants for satellite launchers and spaceport operators to build facilities and launch vehicles.

Momentum and decisive progress is the key here if we want to capture that opportunity. It is one that does not come round often, and we have to take it.” The committee took evidence from a number of witnesses from the aerospace industry before publishing its report. They included McIntyre and other engineers and scientists hoping to develop revolutionary space planes that could take off and land at British spaceports. Metcalfe said the committee’s report identified areas where the next government “needs to look again” before a final bill is introduced.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/catholic-bishops-pressed-to-review-celibacy-rules-shortage-of-priests,"Catholic bishops in England and Wales are facing a fresh call for a national commission on the ordination of married men amid mounting concern that the church’s celibacy requirement is contributing to a shortage of priests. The call for a review of celibacy as a condition of priesthood comes after Pope Francis signalled last month he was open to the possibility of ordaining married men under specific conditions. The issue is expected to raised at a synod next year on vocation. The Movement for Married Clergy (MMaC) is renewing its call for a national commission of bishops, clergy and laity to discuss ways of tackling the shortage of priests. “We’re asking bishops to recognise the issue and examine possible solutions in good faith,” said the MMaC secretary, Chris McDonnell. A recent editorial in the Catholic Times endorsed the call. “What has the church got to lose by establishing such a commission? Or perhaps more importantly, the focus should concentrate on what the church has to gain from such a move,” it said. According to Catholic church figures, 25 men entered training for the diocesan priesthood in 2016 for England and Wales compared with more than 150 in 1985, although the pace of decline has slowed in recent years. “We have a very advancing age profile of serving priests, and low numbers of people going into seminaries,” said McDonnell. “At the moment, it’s just about manageable. But in five years’ time it’s going to be very different. We want to use this window of opportunity to look at what could be done.” Last year it was announced that a third of the 62 Catholic churches in north Wales would close by 2020 because of a shortage of priests under the retirement age. In January, Salford diocese said more than 20 churches across Greater Manchester would close and about 100 parishes would merge, partly because of falling numbers of priests. The MMaC said Pope Francis’s comments suggested a new openness to the idea of married priests. In a separate interview, Cardinal Walter Kasper, a German theologian close to Francis, said the pope wanted to leave the decision up to local bishops’ conferences. “The [vocation] situation differs so widely in different parts of the world that a uniform worldwide solution is not possible,” Kasper told a German church website, katholisch.de. Each bishops’ conference should decide whether it was in favour of married priests and then submit proposals to the pope. “I have the feeling that if their application is well-founded, it will be met positively.” He added: “We simply cannot carry on with the situation as it is at the present … One cannot just go on clustering more and more parishes together into ever larger entities.” Celibacy is a matter of church discipline rather than doctrine, and Catholic priests were often married up until the 12th century. In the UK, married Anglican clergy who joined the Catholic church in disagreement over the ordination of women have continued to serve as priests. “I think the vast majority of lay Catholics would accept married clergy – particularly young people for whom it is a no-brainer,” said McDonnell. “But we want to be very clear that we’re not rejecting celibacy. If a man decides as part of his vocation to be celibate, we’d applaud his dedication. Celibacy and the priesthood should not be considered incompatible.” Two of the church’s 22 serving bishops, Tom Burns of Menevia and Seamus Cunningham of Hexham and Newcastle, and three retired bishops have backed married priests in recent years. However, the bishops’ conference of England and Wales rejected a proposal to ordain married men in 2015. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, archbishop of Westminster and leader of the church in England and Wales, has said he sees no need for change. “I don’t think we are in a [vocations] crisis in England and Wales.” he told the Irish Catholic in February. adding: “I personally value … the celibacy of the priesthood.” Father Christopher Jamison of the Catholic National Office for Vocation said he had “no problem” with the ordination of married men, but “it does not solve the fundamental challenges facing churches today”. He pointed out that the Anglican church ordained married men and women yet still faced a clergy shortage and declining congregations. Pope Francis has said the next synod in October 2018 will discuss the decline in vocations. Reports have suggested the pope wanted the issue of celibacy to be discussed but yielded to objections from his advisers.",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/renamed-and-shamed-taking-on-britains-slave-trade-past-from-colston-hall-to-penny-lane,"Edward Colston is, says Katie Finnegan-Clarke, “almost like a cult figure” in Bristol. There is a Colston Street, and Colston Tower is on Colston Avenue. There is even a Colston bun, which you might eat on Colston’s Day. Finnegan-Clarke, one of the activists in the Countering Colston campaign, went to Colston’s Girls’ school, where “there are statues everywhere, and we had three ceremonies every year to celebrate his life.” Colston was a 17th-century philanthropist who gave great sums of money to the city – money he had made from slavery. This week it was announced that there would be one less Bristol institution bearing his name. The concert venue Colston Hall – which has been a target for activists for decades – will reopen in 2020, after its refurbishment, with a new name. “We knew it was the right thing for the organisation,” says Louise Mitchell, the chief executive of the trust that runs the venue. “It’s very important to us as a progressive forward-looking arts organisation that we include everybody, and people felt uncomfortable entering the building because of the perception that it had in some way profited from the slave trade.” That wasn’t technically true, she says – it was built nearly 150 years after Colston’s death, and was unimaginatively named after its address, Colston Street, but its name still stands as a memorial to the man. It has seen performances from giants such as Ella Fitzgerald, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and David Bowie, but the Bristol band Massive Attack have famously boycotted the venue because of its name. “There are very strong views on both sides; we always knew there would be a backlash,” she says. “Some people are cheering, some are booing, but what I had to do was take the right decision for the organisation. We can’t be inclusive if people won’t come into the building.” A poll for the Bristol Post had found that people opposed renaming the venue two to one, and there have been accusations of airbrushing history. “I think the organisations that hold him up in that honorary position are the ones who are airbrushing history,” says Finnegan-Clarke. “He was one of the most powerful slave traders in Britain: 85,000 Africans were kidnapped and enslaved while he was running the Royal Africa Company. I think by honouring him, that’s airbrushing history.”                                    Facebook        Twitter        Pinterest         A flyer for a Beatles concert at Colston Hall in Bristol in March 1963. Photograph: Alamy   The renaming of Colston Hall “is probably the first significant change in the UK,” says Nicholas Draper, director of the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at UCL. “There will be others. It’s a wider process that’s unfolding in the US, and is probably true in France to a degree. Anywhere there is the significant imprint of slavery, and maybe the wider imprint of colonialism, then this will happen more and more. We’ve had, in the end, a public culture that has been relatively unreflective of the post-colonial moment, and that’s no longer a tenable position.” There are other campaigns in Bristol, a city built on wealth accrued through the slave trade. Countering Colston has its sights set on the large bronze statue in the city centre, which it wants moved to a museum. At the University of Bristol, there is a campaign to rename the Wills Memorial Building. Henry Overton Wills was from the tobacco-giant family, and Wills “symbolises the great wealth acquired through the enslavement of individuals of African descent,” says Asher Websdale, one of three students who started a petition. “It’s not a name that the student body can unanimously state they are proud to stand as a centrepiece in the university. Our history lacks the commemoration of women and people of colour; a name change could allow us to take a step toward rectifying this injustice.” In February, a city councillor in Glasgow proposed – temporarily, but symbolically – renaming Buchanan and Dunlop Street, named in honour of tobacco magnates. Nina Baker, a Green party councillor, acknowledges it would take a huge effort to rename them permanently, but, she says, “I thought we could start the ball rolling by raising awareness. I’d seen something about Spain doing this, renaming streets that had been named after fascist-era people after women freedom-fighters.” The same was proposed in Liverpool in 2006, about Tarleton Street, Manesty’s Lane and Clarence Street, but the idea was dropped – partly because it would have meant renaming Penny Lane, which was named to commemorate slave ship-owner James Penny, but is now more famous as the title of a Beatles song. The US is ahead of Britain on this. This week, Confederate monuments were removed from streets in New Orleans. “The removal of these statues sends a clear and unequivocal message to the people of New Orleans and the nation: New Orleans celebrates our diversity, inclusion and tolerance,” says mayor, Mitch Landrieu. “Relocating these Confederate monuments is not about taking something away from someone else. This is not about politics, blame or retaliation. This is not a naive quest to solve all our problems at once. This is about showing the whole world that we as a city and as a people are able to acknowledge, understand, reconcile – and most importantly – choose a better future. We can remember these divisive chapters in our history in a museum or other facility where they can be put in context – and that’s where these statues belong.” Forrest Park in Memphis – originally named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Confederate general and first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan – was renamed in 2013; the KKK protested.

In February, following a long wrangle, Yale announced it would change the name of Calhoun College (named after John Calhoun, a US vice-president and supporter of slavery,) but it will not remove symbols of him around the campus. In 2015, there were student-led protests at Princeton to remove former president and segregationist Woodrow Wilson’s name from the university (the university refused). Last year, Harvard Law School dropped its seal, which was based on the family crest of a slave-owner, Isaac Royall. The Rhodes Must Fall movement started in 2015 at the University of Cape Town, to remove a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes, and spread to other universities, including Oxford, which has a statue of Rhodes at Oriel College. Earlier this year, there was discussion about removing eugenicist Francis Galton’s name from a lecture theatre and laboratory at UCL. Not everyone thinks renaming is the answer – and renaming, anyway, is only a small part of ongoing discussions about how countries should deal with their involvement in slavery. “The danger is we end up erasing the past rather than problematising it,” says John Oldfield, director of the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation at Hull University. “An alternative strategy might be to use these names as a way of drawing attention to the complexities. You should use those names to discuss the past, because that informs how we understand the present.” He points to the way Brown University in the US has acknowledged its past. Brown is considered the leader on this issue: president Ruth Simmons commissioned a report on the university’s history, and as a result introduced a number of measures including establishing the Centre for the Study of Slavery and Justice, and an endowment fund to support disadvantaged children. In Bristol, many say that it is not possible to forget the city’s connection to the brutal trade in human beings. “It cannot be airbrushed. There are so many other things in Bristol that remind us about the slaving past,” says Olivette Otele, a historian at Bath Spa university. The issue is that a name given to a place or building is “a recognition of a contribution, it’s a celebration”.  Legacies of British slave ownership map infographic  Based on a map provided by the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at UCL   What is happening in Bristol, she says, “is important because it means Bristolians themselves are shaping their own present, and how they want to remember the past and write the future. It’s their decision, and I’m excited about the whole thing.” Things get more complicated when one considers where such moves should stop. Draper likes to think of it in terms of a hierarchy, or concentric circles, where slave-traders would be the “bullseye”, with owners of enslaved people closely following, and people who benefited from the trade, the bankers who financed it, and people who had connections, however remote, in the outer rings. “We’d need to have some sense of where the boundaries are, or could be. But I think ‘slave-trader’ is something very difficult to push away.” Does it matter if most people passing a statue or a place name have no idea who the commemorated person is? “Isn’t that exactly the point?” he says. “That we’re celebrating people, and have forgotten what they did?” The writer Amit Chaudhuri was invited to address Rhodes Must Fall activists at Oxford in 2015. In a piece he wrote for the Guardian, he remembered how he hadn’t noticed the Rhodes sculpture when his wife was at Oriel College in the early 1990s, and recalled once looking in on a talk given by Enoch Powell, not with horror, but a feeling that the once-divisive politician was now irrelevant, a relic; it seemed to him as though we were heading towards genuine equality and diversity. But two decades on, he argues that something else entirely is going on, and points to “how narrow the culture has become in Britain, in a very insidious way”.      Bristol: the city that lauds the slave trader | David Olusoga           Read more       Over the last 20 years, and particularly since 9/11, he says, there has been a turn against multiculturalism – some people have become seen as a threat to “our” way of life, resulting in a kind of closing down. It was there in Theresa May’s vans targeting “illegal” migrants, he says, in fears over immigration and the nostalgia for past British “glories” that stoked Brexit, and in the government’s pitiful response to the refugee crisis. The other thing that has happened, he argues, is a widening economic gulf between the rich and those who have suffered most from the economic crash. “The affluent of the past, who became affluent out of exploitation – statues of those people begin to kind of chafe.” The statues and names, and the history they stand for, “seem to be in collusion with the closing down that’s happening, and the [class] who are protecting themselves. I think that’s part of why it has become more urgent today. I don’t know what the solution is, in terms of removing statues or renaming places, but at the same time, I can understand why it’s happening.”",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/29/marine-a-alexander-blackman-enjoys-first-hours-of-freedom,"Alexander Blackman, the Royal Marine sergeant convicted of killing a wounded Taliban fighter, has been enjoying his first hours of freedom but has made it clear he understands his sentence is not complete and has promised to fulfil the conditions of his early release. Blackman was freed from prison after serving half of the seven-year term imposed for manslaughter and was whisked away to a luxury country hideaway arranged by the Daily Mail, which backed his legal fight.  He told the tabloid: “Being out of prison is an immense feeling but I am very conscious that my sentence is not complete. I have been released on licence and there are certain conditions which I must – and will – respect.   “But it is the little things I can enjoy. Suddenly I can sleep when I want, eat when I want, go for a walk ... this freedom of choice over basic things is going to take some getting used to.”  Typically prisoners on licence have to stay in close touch with a supervisor, seek permission before travelling out of the UK and get approval for any work they take on. Misbehaviour can result in a return to jail.  Blackman described his wife, who led the campaign to free him, as a “wife in a million”. He said: “I will be eternally grateful to Claire and I cannot put into words how wonderful she is.  “Other inmates often said how lucky I was to have her fighting so hard for me. I don’t think there is anybody who has witnessed the effort she has gone to who will doubt how she feels about me, and that’s beyond words really. You just can’t imagine anyone cares for you that much.” Claire Blackman told the Mail she had felt a “surge of happiness” when her husband arrived at the country bolthole, describing their reunion as “like a dream”. “We have spent so long on this rollercoaster ride and have always steeled ourselves for the worst-case scenario,” she said. “Now we have got Al out, the result we always hoped for, it is taking time to sink in.” Blackman was convicted in 2013 of murdering a Taliban prisoner while on tour in Helmand province in Afghanistan, and jailed for life. The conviction was quashed when the court martial appeal court ruled he had been suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the shooting in 2011.  His conviction was replaced with manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and his sentence reduced from life to seven years. He was smuggled out of prison in Wiltshire in the early hours of Friday and was taken to a rural hideaway, where according to the Mail, he was treated to Hungarian goose-down duvets, roaring fires and roll-top baths.  He has been offered a job by the former marine John Davies, who also campaigned for Blackman to be freed, as an instructor in his maritime training business.  The Guardian has also learned that Blackman has enjoyed writing while in prison and may try to get a children’s story about a cuddly mole published.  According to his lawyer, Jonathan Goldberg QC, there is also interest from Hollywood in making a film of the saga.   Blackman is still entitled to a military pension and supporters have raised money to help him and his wife set themselves up.  The documentary-maker and honorary marine Chris Terrill, who has become close to the Blackmans, said he believed there would be a tricky transition period for the marine.   He said: “It is going to be a difficult transition. Al hasn’t been a civilian for many years.” Terrill also said there would also be a time of readjustment for husband and wife. “I was joking with Claire that they’ll have to work out who is going to control the television zapper.”  He said the idea of a Hollywood film with a star-studded cast was fanciful. “This is not the time to be talking about Hollywood blockbusters,” he said. “It’s a great time for the Blackmans, but it’s a very serious time, too.” Terrill said it was worth remembering the man Blackman had killed. “He was someone’s son, brother, possibly husband.”  Life will never be the same for the Blackmans. The Guardian revealed last month that police had warned them they could be terrorist targets and they have been advised to take a series of precautions including changing their identities and moving house.  Supporters across the country will celebrate Blackman’s release this bank holiday weekend.   The Justice for Marine A website said: “Al fought for us … we fought for him and and against all odds we won. Thank you all for your amazing efforts.”",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/28/tory-mp-steps-down-after-telling-pupils-homosexuality-is-wrong,"A long-serving Conservative MP has said he will not stand in the general election, just hours after A-level students revealed he had told them that he believed “homosexuality is wrong” and “dangerous to society”. Andrew Turner, who has represented the Isle of Wight since 2001, made the comments during a question and answer session at Christ the King College in Newport. One student describing herself as a “passionate campaigner for LGBT rights” asked her local MP if he was involved in the Isle of Wight’s first ever Pride event. In a post on Facebook, Esther Poucher said she was shocked to the point of outrage by Turner’s response. “He told us that he’d been invited, but wasn’t intending to go. This is because (and this is a direct quote) he thinks that homosexuality is ‘wrong’ and “dangerous to society’,” she wrote.                              Facebook        Twitter        Pinterest         Student Esther Poucher Photograph: Facebook   “At this answer, I had to leave. It’s terrifying that in this age and point in our development as a society, there are still people that can’t care enough about a person’s wellbeing to just accept who they are. And the most terrifying thing is that we as an island consistently vote him in to represent us.” Labour’s election campaign chair, Andrew Gwynne, had called on Theresa May to “intervene and investigate immediately” and suspend Turner as a Tory candidate if the allegations were found to be true. “There is no place for bigotry and hatred like this in modern society and no one holding these views is fit for public office.” He said he looked forward to the prime minister speaking out against the suggestion of homophobia in her party to show she was serious about LGBT equality.  The Guardian understands that senior figures in the Conservative party made clear that Turner’s behaviour was unacceptable and that the MP agreed to step aside before he was pushed. One Tory insider said there was “no room in the Conservative party” for homophobic comments. In his statement, Turner did not mention the row. He wrote: “It has been my privilege to serve the people of the Isle of Wight as their member of parliament. “I have been incredibly fortunate to represent such a beautiful constituency. After 16 years I have come to the decision that it is time for a new generation to take up the mantle of representing my fantastic constituents.”     Tim Farron says he doesn't believe being gay is a sin           Read more       He added that he was grateful for the support he had received and would support the Conservative candidate taking his place.  The seat is likely to be popular with Conservative hopefuls given that Turner secured a majority of 13,703 in 2015, representing 41% of the vote. Ukip were in second place with 21%, followed by Labour and the Greens on 13%.  Turner has served on the Conservative’s 1922 committee representing backbenchers and was a vice-chair of the party between 2003 and 2005. His swift decision to step down is in line with an attempt in the Conservative party headquarter’s to keep a close eye on candidates, and try to minimise any sense during the election of elite or extreme views. Sources said that senior aides to May were doing all they could to try to ensure that new candidates most closely matched her desire to appeal to working class communities that traditionally tended to back the Labour party. The prime minister has also reconvened the key figures who supported David Cameron’s 2015 successful campaign led by Sir Lynton Crosby, who is yet to move into Conservative headquarters. She has also brought back Tom Edmonds and Craig Elder who led Cameron’s digital campaign that reached 17 million people a week with bespoke material targeted at key groups of voters. The pair were described as the previous Tory leader’s “secret weapon”. Others back on board include Barack Obama’s former deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina.",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/28/trump-russia-intelligence-uk-government-m16-kremlin,"The UK government was given details last December of allegedly extensive contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow, according to court papers. Reports by Christopher Steele, a former MI6 officer, on possible collusion between the the Trump camp and the Kremlin are at the centre of a political storm in the US over Moscow’s role in getting Donald Trump elected.  It was not previously known that the UK intelligence services had also received the dossier but Steele confirmed in a court filing earlier this month that he handed a memorandum compiled in December to a “senior UK government national security official acting in his official capacity, on a confidential basis in hard copy form”.     How the Trump dossier came to light: secret sources, a retired spy and John McCain           Read more       The court papers say Steele decided to pass on the information he had collected because it was “of considerable importance in relation to alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election”, that it “had implications for the national security of the US and the UK” and “needed to [be] analysed and further investigated/verified”.  The December memo alleged that four Trump representatives travelled to Prague in August or September in 2016 for “secret discussions with Kremlin representatives and associated operators/hackers”, about how to pay hackers secretly for penetrating Democratic party computer systems and “contingency plans for covering up operations”.  Between March and September, the December memo alleges, the hackers used botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs and steal data online from Democratic party leadership. Two of the hackers had been “recruited under duress by the FSB” the memo said. The hackers were paid by the Trump organisation, but were under the control of Vladimir Putin’s presidential administration. Trump has rejected the allegations of collusion as a smear campaign. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, one of Trump representatives named in the memo, has described the claims in the memo as “totally fake, totally inaccurate”, and has said he had never been to Prague.     Since the memo became public in January, Steele had not spoken about his role in compiling it but he and his company, Orbis Business Intelligence Limited, have filed a defence in the high court of justice in London, in a defamation case brought by Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian venture capitalist and owner of a global computer technology company, XBT, and a Dallas-based subsidiary Webzilla.  Gubarev, who was named along with his company in the December memo as being involved in hacking operation, has denied any such involvement and is also suing Buzzfeed in the US courts for publishing the December memo alongside Steele’s earlier reports on election hacking.  A statement by Steele’s defence lawyers, endorsed by the former MI6 agent, said Orbis was hired between June and November last year by Fusion GPS, a Washington-based research consultancy to look into Trump’s links with Russia. In that period, Steele produced 16 memoranda citing mostly Russian sources as describing a web of alleged contacts and collusion between Trump aides and Russian intelligence or other Kremlin representatives. The document said that he passed the memos to Fusion on the understanding that Fusion would not disclose the material to any third parties without the approval of Steele and Orbis. They did agree to Fusion providing a copy to Senator John McCain after the veteran Republican had been told about the existence of Steele’s research by Sir Andrew Wood, a former UK ambassador to Moscow and an Orbis associate, at a conference in Canada on 8 November.      What we know – and what's true – about the Trump-Russia dossier           Read more       Senator McCain handed a copy of the Steele memos to James Comey, the FBI director, on 9 December.  After delivering these reports, the court papers say Steele and Orbis continued to receive “unsolicited intelligence” on Trump-Russia links, and Steele decided that to draw up another memo with this new information which was dated 13 December.  He handed one copy over to the senior British national security official and sent an encrypted version to Fusion with instructions to deliver a hard copy to Senator McCain.  The defence argues that Steele and Orbis were under a duty to pass on the information “so that it was known to the United Kingdom and United States governments at a high level by persons with responsibility for national security”. Steele and Orbis say they never gave any copies to news organisations although Steele said he gave off-the-record briefings about the dossier to a small number of journalists in late summer and early autumn 2016. The defence brief argues that neither Steele nor Orbis is liable for Buzzfeed’s decision to print the document.  The Steele dossier was referred to in an intelligence briefing provided by the FBI and US intelligence agencies to Obama and Trump in January. Comey has confirmed that counter-intelligence investigations are under way into possible links between Trump associates and Moscow, and CNN has reported that the FBI used the dossier to bolster its investigations.",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/28/eu-leaders-to-insist-uk-pays-its-brexit-bills-as-precursor-to-trade-talks,"EU leaders will toughen their stance on Britain paying its Brexit bills when they agree negotiating guidelines at a special summit on Saturday. EU diplomats have agreed unanimously that Britain must settle its bills before embarking on trade talks. The position has been set out by EU leaders from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, but this will be the toughest statement yet from all 27 countries.     Tories’ ‘imperial vision’ for post-Brexit trade branded disruptive and deluded           Read more       “Member states are maximalist on the budget issue, because if Britain doesn’t pay, other member states will have to pay,” an EU diplomat said. Another senior diplomat said he had never seen net payers and recipients “working so closely with each other” in a wry allusion to the perennial tensions between countries that pay most into the EU budget and those that receive the biggest grants. The UK is due to make a net payment of around £20.4bn into the EU pot in 2019-20, in line with a promise David Cameron made in 2012 when he negotiated the EU’s seven-year budget. The European commission, however, believes the bill could come to as much as €60bn (£50bn) once the UK’s contribution to EU liabilities, pensions and special funds is taken into account. Barnier’s team will not present a bill on day one of the talks, but instead hopes to bind Britain to a set of principles on paying its dues, an approach broadly backed by Germany. EU leaders will not get into the specifics of money or the other two issues seen as essential parts of the divorce deal - citizens’ rights and the Irish border - on Saturday. They will focus discussions on what counts as sufficient progress for talks to start on trade. If they agree the UK has made progress on the divorce by the autumn, talks on a trade deal could start from early 2018.

Diplomats stress that they do not expect Irish unification.  In a letter to EU leaders ahead of the summit, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, reiterated that the bloc would stick to its timetable. “We will not discuss our future relations with the UK until we have achieved sufficient progress on the main issues relating to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU,” he said. “This is not only a matter of tactics, but - given the limited time frame we have to conclude the talks – it is the only possible approach.” EU leaders will also be briefed by Jean-Claude Juncker on his dinner with Theresa May at Downing Street earlier this week. Merkel was given the key points in an early morning phone call with the European commission president on Thursday. A few hours later she told German MPs that British politicians were still living under the illusion that the country could retain its rights and privileges after Brexit.

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/28/cancer-surgeon-convicted-of-performing-needless-breast-surgery,"The NHS has been forced to pay out almost £10m in compensation to more than 250 patients of a rogue surgeon found guilty of carrying out needless breast operations on patients who were left traumatised and scarred. Consultant surgeon Ian Stuart Paterson, 59, was convicted on Friday of 17 counts of wounding with intent, relating to nine women and one man. He was also convicted of three further wounding charges. Jurors at the seven-week trial at Nottingham crown court decided the surgeon carried out “extensive, life-changing operations for no medically justifiable reason” on the 10 patients between 1997 and 2011. He could have more than 1,000 additional victims, among them hundreds of private Spire Healthcare patients who may never be compensated for botched and unnecessary surgery.     Ian Paterson: the 'likable' breast surgeon who wounded his patients           Read more       Paterson, described in court by one victim as being “like God”, lied to patients and exaggerated or invented the risk of cancer to convince them to go under his knife. The jury at Nottingham crown court heard the surgeon, who saw hundreds of patients a year, carried out the operations for “obscure motives”, which may have included a desire to earn extra money. Paterson, wearing a black suit, blue shirt and red tie, sobbed as the jury returned the guilty verdicts. Judge Jeremy Baker released the surgeon on conditional bail ahead of sentencing in May, telling him he faced a custodial sentence. The maximum sentence for wounding with intent is life. One patient who gave evidence in the trial had 27 biopsy cores taken from her healthy right breast, which one expert told the court were random, and had “absolutely not” received medical best practice.  In tears, Frances Perks told the jury Patterson had conned her into thinking she was high risk and that he had destroyed her life. “He’s a psychopath. Why would anyone in their right mind do operations to people knowing that they didn’t need them?” she said, adding that she hoped he would rot in hell.  A number of Paterson’s former patients have died since being treated by him. Concerns were raised about his practice of carrying out so-called “cleavage-saving mastectomies”, which left behind tissue. This method meant that the chances of a relapse within five years doubled. One patient, Michelle Flavelle, died five years after Paterson treated her when her cancer spread to her liver, though it was not possible to establish a definitive connection.  Paterson denied misrepresenting patients’ test results to dupe insurers into paying for surgery, but other former patients have told the Guardian he exaggerated or invented the risk of cancer and, in some cases, claimed payments for more expensive procedures than those he had carried out. Ch Supt Mark Payne called Paterson a “controlling bully, who played God with people’s lives so he could live a luxurious lifestyle”. “The procedures carried out by Ian Paterson on vulnerable patients were unnecessary and caused physical suffering, scars and wounds to the patients,” he said. “Also, as a result of his greed and arrogance, many of the patients have suffered psychologically, believing they needed to undergo the procedures because they were at risk from breast cancer.”     There were no depths he wouldn't go to, says Ian Paterson surgery victim           Read more       Paterson was employed by the Heart of England NHS trust in 1998 despite having previously been suspended from Good Hope hospital in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. He also practised at Spire Healthcare hospitals in the Midlands over a 13-year period. The NHS has so far paid out around £18m including £9.5m in damages, settling 256 cases, with 25 outstanding, the Guardian has learned. Hundreds of Paterson’s private patients may never see a penny after his insurance company, the Medical Defence Union, said its cover was “discretionary” and had been withdrawn.  Paterson had a limited separate insurance policy of £10m, which solicitors say will not nearly cover the compensation and costs of all private patients. Another 350 people are still suing the NHS and Spire Healthcare over treatment in private hospitals where Paterson also practised. Spire Healthcare, which runs Parkway and Little Aston hospitals have settled some cases, but argue that as Paterson was not technically their employee, they are not responsible for his actions. The company would not divulge any details about the compensation paid. A Spire spokesman said: “What Mr Paterson did in our hospitals, in other private hospitals and in the NHS, absolutely should not have happened and today justice has been done. “We would like to reiterate how truly sorry we are for the distress experienced by any patients affected by this case. “We can say unequivocally that we have learned the lessons from these events. We commissioned a thorough independent investigation and have fully implemented all of the recommendations.” Sarah Jane Downing, who set up a petition demanding compensation for Paterson’s private victims, said she had been left “shocked and appalled” at the lack of redress.                                Facebook        Twitter        Pinterest         Sarah Jane Downing said Paterson’s private patients ‘bought into those promises in the glossy brochures’. Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian   “Many of these people chose private healthcare because they bought into those promises in the glossy brochures. And now we have realised that those promises are not worth the paper they are printed on. It’s utterly devastating,” she said. At a recent coffee morning for former Paterson patients, many described the consultant’s “brilliant” bedside manner. “He was so lovely, I thought I was so lucky. I thought I was being looked after,” said Elaine Diskin, whom Paterson operated on eight times in as many years. Her husband, Mike, also respected for the surgeonto the extent that when he had a pain in his chest, he went to Paterson and did not hesitate when he said he suspected lipoma and that they “had to get it out”. “Sinister was the word he used,” Mike Diskin said. “I had no reason to doubt him because he was looking after Elaine so well.” They trusted Paterson so much that they also recommended his care to a friend, who went on to have a lump removed. “We used to joke that we’d paid for his skiing holidays,” Elaine Diskin said. After the Diskins were recalled for a review of their treatment in 2012, they discovered that at least seven of the eight operations Paterson had performed on Elaine, along with those on her husband and their friend, were unnecessary. A civil case with seven test cases, which will determine to what extent Spire, the Heart of England NHS Trust and Paterson can be held liable, is scheduled to be heard in October, but looks likely to be delayed. The outcome will affect all the private patients who have brought civil claims and fear they may receive nothing. It is believed that Spire has made a handful of payments, the largest about £150,000, including for unnecessary removal of lumps and “cleavage-sparing mastectomies”, a controversial operation that left breast tissue behind after the removal of cancerous cells. Kashmir Uppal of Access Legal has worked with Paterson’s former patients since 2010. She said his actions had terrible consequences for her clients. “I am pleased that the jury have found him guilty and hope that this verdict will start the process of closure for his victims and early settlement of their civil claims,” she said.  “However, we now need a full public enquiry to ensure tighter regulation of patient care in the private sector, and to prevent this happening in the future.” Lesley Cuthbert, who did not feature in the trial but had a series of unnecessary operations carried out by Paterson, said she was “over the moon” about the outcome. “There is no forgiveness. What he has done will always be with us, but at least we can now start to move on.” Concerns about Paterson were raised as far back as 2003, but despite several internal and external investigations and complaints from patients, GPs and other surgeons, the General Medical Council did not suspend him until 2011. “In every profession you get rogue operators, but there are checks and balances to stop terrible things happening,” said Mike Diskin. “Why were there not in this case, or why were they ignored?” Timeline 1998: Paterson is hired as a consultant surgeon at the Heart of England NHS trust, despite being previously suspended from Good Hope hospital. He also sees private patients at Spire Healthcare hospitals of Little Aston and Parkway. 2003: He is investigated because of concerns about cleavage-sparing mastectomies. Recommendations are not followed through. 2007: Breast surgeon Hemant Ingle is appointed and with others raises concerns.

Mark Goldman, the chief executive of the Heart of England NHS trust, informs Spire that it is investigating Paterson. 2008: Two GPs complain about Paterson’s treatment of a patient, saying he gave misleading information about pathology reports, overtreated patients and disregarded the multidisciplinary team meeting process. Another report is also critical. 2009: A Spire Parkway patient makes a formal complaint about Paterson. No action is taken. Heart of England NHS trust recalls 12 patients who have had cleavage-sparing mastectomies.

A month later, the GMC informed Spire about another patient complaint. A recall of all Paterson’s patients begins.

The personal flight suit, called Daedalus, is capable of propelling wearers much higher and faster than demonstrated on the day, according to Browning.

Khalid Mohamed Omar Ali, 27, was arrested by armed police on Thursday afternoon yards from the Houses of Parliament and the scene of the previous terrorist attack in March in which five people lost their lives. Counter-terrorism detectives continued questioning Ali on Friday. He had been under surveillance for weeks by MI5 and the Metropolitan police over concerns he had been lured by violent extremism. Ali was a schoolboy in inner north London who by the age of 21 had set sail on a ship to take relief supplies to Gaza on a mission that eschewed politics or religion but nonetheless became mired in difficulty and never reached its destination. Ali was being questioned at Southwark police station in south London, with detectives trying to piece together why he was in Westminster with two knives, what he intended to do with the implements and why. He is understood to have been a “lone actor”. Ali was born outside of Britain, moved to the UK at a young age and went to school in Tottenham, north London, a multicultural area that has a long history of neglect and where sections of the community mistrust the police and other authorities. In 2010 Ali joined the Road to Hope convoy taking aid to Gaza, sources have confirmed. He and other volunteers boarded the Strofades IV ship in Libya. The convoy leader, Kieran Turner, said it was apolitical. Turner said: “The people who were involved with this convoy were the ones who went to really do humanitarian care. “These were young men who were very keen to do something to help and for a lot of them it was a great introduction – some of them are still trustees on charities.” The voyage saw a falling out between the captain and those on board, and that part of the journey was aborted, with the vessel ending up in Greece with the humanitarian activists on board complaining of their treatment. Ali was last registered to an address in Enfield, north London, but is no longer resident there, according to official residence documents. His arrest followed counter-terrorism investigators tracking him as he traveled through London and armed officers were laying in wait and swooped on him in an area full of high-profile buildings such as the House of Parliament and Downing Street. He is alleged to have been carrying two knives in a bag that spilled out into the middle of the road as he was grabbed by police and put on the ground. Concerns about his behaviour were reported to police by at least one member of the Muslim community and led to a joint MI5 and Met police investigation.       Play Video           0:59           Armed police detain man near Houses of Parliament – video report   Ali was arrested at 2.22pm, police said, “on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. Knives have been recovered from him”. Police also said that they had carried out two searches at addresses in London as part of their inquiries into Ali. His arrest at junction of Parliament Street and Parliament Square was just yards from where Khalid Masood first drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and then used a knife to stab a police officer to death. Investigators will be examining electronic devices seized during the searches and any computers or smartphones used by Ali to look for evidence of online material viewed and whom he was in contact with. Britain remains at a severe level of terrorism alert, meaning an attack is highly likely. Ali’s arrest was followed five hours later by arrests in Willesden, north west London. The Guardian understands investigators believe both operations thwarted terrorist attack plots that they fear may have been imminent. A source said of both had attracted “the very highest level of priority” from police and MI5. Despite their belief that two attack plans were disrupted within five hours of each other, at least two other suspected jihadist plots were on Friday being monitored and under investigation. Developments on Thursday were incorporated into a regular review of the alert status, but it was left unchanged. Met police counter-terrorism units and MI5 have been operating at an intense workload for two years with the rise of Islamic State and its call for attacks on the west, with 13 plots thwarted since 2013. Met police deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism, said: “Activity continues around the clock to identify and stop these threats and we are making arrests on a near daily basis.”",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/28/man-charged-with-of-former-navy-officer-hit-with-own-car,"A man has been charged with murder in connection with the death of a former Royal Navy officer who was allegedly run over by thieves stealing his car. Mike Samwell, from Chorlton in Manchester who served in the navy for 12 years, died in the early hours of 23 April. Ryan Gibbons, also from Chorlton, has since been charged with murder, burglary and aggravated vehicle-taking. Greater Manchester police say the 29-year-old has been remanded in custody ready to appear before Manchester magistrates court on Saturday. The 35-year-old victim suffered fatal injuries after he is believed to have confronted thieves. The former navy engineer, whose wife Jess was home at the time, was taken to hospital for treatment but died a short time later. Police believe Samwell was run over at least once.  DI Lewis Hughes, of the force’s major incident team, said: “This has been a fast-moving investigation and we have made significant progress since Mike’s murder and have now arrested two more people, who will be questioned by detectives.” A 15-year-old boy was also arrested on suspicion of murder but there is no news as to whether he has also been charged. Two other men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested on suspicion of murder earlier this week but were bailed pending further inquiries. In a statement issued via GMP, Samwell’s family said his death “made a huge hole in our lives that can never be filled”.",The Guardian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/apr/28/headteacher-and-deputy-send-resignation-letter-to-parents-longparish-primary-school-hampshire,"A couple working as headteacher and deputy head at a Hampshire primary school rated as outstanding have written to parents saying they are quitting because they are so disillusioned by the direction of education policy. In their letter, Alex and Peter Foggo said they were so profoundly opposed to recent changes in England’s schools that the only morally honest course open to them was to resign from their jobs at Longparish primary school. The couple’s catalogue of complaints ranged from changes to the curriculum and the impact of high-stakes testing on the mental health of very young children, to concern about the reintroduction of grammar schools and the freezing of schools budgets that is leading to widespread cuts. They plan to leave education altogether.     How are the cuts affecting your school? Share your experiences | Sarah Marsh           Read more       “Unfortunately we find that current education policy is in such profound opposition to what we fundamentally believe in, in terms of child welfare and development, as to make our continued work in teaching untenable,” the letter to parents said. “This is not a decision that we have taken lightly, but one that we feel has been forced upon us. Increasingly we have found ourselves having to implement policy with which we fundamentally disagree.” The letter, which went out this week to parents of the 100 children enrolled at the Church of England school, continued: “Recent developments in education have brought our position to a point of personal, professional and ethical crisis, leading to our current decision.” The Foggos, who have been in the teaching profession for almost 50 years combined, said changes to the primary curriculum with its “narrow” focus on reading, spelling, grammar and maths had led to “an increasingly bland and joyless educational diet”, all leading up to tests at the end of years 2 and 6. “The excitement, creativity and wonder that we came into teaching to nurture and encourage have been largely driven out by the rote learning of facts. Combined with this is the increased stress and potential for mental health issues that we see resulting from the pressure placed on young children by these tests.” On cuts to school to funding, an issue that is expected to feature prominently in the general election campaign, the couple said: “The freezing of school budgets, which have meant significant cuts in real terms, have left school leaders with often impossible choices to make. “Which staff do you make redundant? Which subjects do you cut? Which child with an identified special educational need do you select to stop receiving support? “These are not decisions that we believe are in educational or developmental interests of children, nor should school leaders have to be making them in what is one of the wealthiest nations in the world.” The Foggos also condemned Theresa May’s commitment to lift the ban on new grammar schools and extend selection as “socially, morally and educationally wrong”. Education by academic selection, they said, pitted children against each other in “a rat race” from the beginning of their lives. “Pupils will be reduced to competition units, constantly aware of who’s ‘better’ and who’s ‘worse’ in a permanent struggle of tests, exams, scores, ratings and league tables.” Parents of pupils at the school, which serves the villages of Longparish and Hurstbourne Priors, expressed shock that the head and deputy head would not be returning after the summer holiday. James Whiting said: “I just did not see this coming. The school is absolutely outstanding. Mrs Foggo has the deepest commitment to the education of children that I’ve come across in my life. For someone like that to feel that they can no longer run a school is just very worrying.” Another parent, Ingrid Sanderson, said: “I am very sorry the Foggos have decided to leave not only Longparish primary school but education altogether. The education system in this country should not be without teachers of this calibre, yet the current setup seems to be driving them away.” Dinah Nabarro added: “I’m very sorry they feel that the only option is to leave – but I also understand why it’s their only option.” Alex Foggo, who has been head at Longparish for 11 years, told the Guardian: “It’s a very, very sad decision to have to make. I never thought I would leave education before I retired, but parents have been very supportive. They totally understand.”     Put this in your party’s election manifesto           Read more       She said her and her husband’s decision was not shaped by a single factor but an accumulation of concerns. “It’s been one thing after the other, with the changes to the curriculum and assessment and all the trouble that’s caused, and all the stress it’s placed children under … It’s lots of things coming together.” Peter Foggo added: “We’ve had enough of this government’s education policies and what it’s doing to children and teachers.” The couple are among a growing number of teachers, in particular senior school leaders, who are leaving the profession at a time when it is struggling to recruit sufficient new staff. Research published on Friday reported that headteacher retention rates had fallen between 2012 and 2015. A government consultation on the future of primary assessment is currently under way. Asked for a comment, the Department for Education, limited by pre-election purdah, pointed to an earlier commitment not to introduce any more tests in primary school until 2018-19 and the scrapping of proposals to introduce year 7 resits for those who do not achieve the expected level of education at the end of primary school. On funding, the government said it has protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, with school funding at its highest level on record at almost £41bn in 2017-18. On grammar schools, the DfE has previously said bright children from disadvantaged backgrounds thrived at grammars, which is why there were plans for new selective school places to be provided. A team working for the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) found that retention rates at primary schools fell from 94% to 92% and at secondaries from 91% to 87%. Retention rates were lower in schools with low levels of attainment. NFER’s chief executive, Carole Willis, said: “The leadership pipeline is vital to the success of our education system. Given the challenges facing the system it’s more important than ever to understand how headteacher retention rates are changing, and why.”",The Guardian,0
Article1.txt,"﻿Man is accused of beating Muslim outside mosque Omar Mateen attended BY JORDAN MCPHERSON AND ALEX HARRIS A Muslim man was reportedly attacked outside the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce early Saturday morning — the same mosque Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen occasionally worshiped at. The alleged attacker, 25-year-old Taylor Mazzanti, was arrested on felony battery charges Saturday. He was booked into St. Lucie County Jail and released on a $3,750 bond, according to the jail. After the attack, the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Florida said it plans to file a complaint with Gov. Rick Scott and the U.S. Department of Justice. In a press release, the group says local authorities ignored requests for increased security, despite numerous threats since Mateen fatally shot 49 people at a nightclub on June 12. At about 4:15 a.m. Saturday, a time when some are still praying during the holy month of Ramadan, a white truck stopped in front of the mosque. A man stepped out uttering racial slurs, according to the press release from the council, which is the largest Muslim civil rights group in Florida. “You Muslims need to get back to your country,” the man reportedly said before hitting the mosque member in the head and knocking out a tooth, according to the press release. The victim wasn’t identified, and it wasn’t clear if he was hospitalized. Abdul Rauf Khan, the assistant executive director of Islamic Circle of North America Relief, reportedly saw the altercation and called 911. Two St. Lucie County Sheriff deputies arrived at the scene and arrested the suspect about an hour later. In a release from the Port St. Lucie Sheriff’s Office, Sheriff Ken Mascara said interviews and a written witness statement from the victim “do not indicate any racially-motivated comments were made by the suspect prior to, during or after the incident.” “The untruthful rhetoric from the mosque and its spokesperson is doing nothing more than trying to bring empathy to their cause, which I hope our community recognizes,” Sheriff Mascara said. “My office, including myself and our agency Chaplain, have repeatedly attempted to communicate with the mosque to explore options of working together and there has been no response.” A West Palm Beach Beach TV reporter tweeted pictures of the victim and his bloody hands as he was photographed by police. “This should not have happened,” Wilfredo Ruiz, CAIR-Florida’s communications director, said in the release. “For over two weeks we have been emphasizing that the community from the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce needs to be offered security from the Sheriff’s Office. Unfortunately, our requests were repeatedly ignored. Will someone have to be killed for the sheriff to provide safety and security to this Mosque?” Ruiz said the Fort Pierce mosque’s leaders have attempted to hire St. Lucie County sheriff’s deputies to provide security but have been rejected, Miami Herald news partner CBS4 reported on Tuesday. The mosque has about 100 regular members, including Mateen’s father. About 170,000 Muslims attend about 120 mosques in Florida, according to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies. “Muslims are part of the community just like everyone else,” Ruiz said in the release. “It is his duty and responsibility to ensure the safety of all his citizens.” St. Lucie Sheriff Ken Mascara had issued a statement Friday saying deputies were patrolling the mosque more frequently but the office didn’t have the staffing levels to place guards there, even if reimbursed. “The terrorist attack in Orlando has our entire agency working extremely hard,” Mascara said in the statement. “Our first and primary mission is to ensure the continued safety and security of our entire county. Placing patrol units at specific locations by special request, even if reimbursed by the requesting party, is evaluated based on staffing levels and can at times limit our ability to maintain our mission and appropriately respond to the entire community.”",A local paper,1
Article2.txt,"﻿Murderer of Laguna hotel manager gets life without parole By ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER March 1, 2014 at 7:30 am     SANTA ANA – A 23-year-old Lake Forest man will spend the rest of his life in prison for the 2009 bludgeoning death of a beloved Laguna Beach hotel manager. Friends of victim Damon Nicholson wept Friday as Judge James A. Stotler ordered Matthew Thomas Dragna to serve the sentence with no chance of parole. Stotler read out the sentence to a quiet, mostly empty courtroom Friday, save the occasional rattle of Dragna’s jailhouse chains, the whistle of wind as a storm blew outside and the quiet sobs of two of Nicholson’s close friends, who comforted each other during the proceeding. “May he never feel the warmth of a hug from a loved one, share happy times with those he cares about or have the freedom to pursue his dreams. Your honor, take from him some of what he took from Damon and those that loved him,” said Carla Bravo, Nicholson’s friend of 20 years, during an impassioned statement to the court. “Justice must be served.” No more long talks on the phone, movie nights with bonbons or Trivial Pursuit after spending Thanksgivings together, Bravo told the court. The two met while working together at Denny’s, she said. Nicholson, who was a sales and catering manager at Hotel Laguna, was found bludgeoned to death in his Dolphin Way apartment on Oct. 24, 2009. A jury convicted Dragna of murder during a robbery – a special circumstance under California law with a penalty of death or life without parole. Prosecutors said Dragna, after having a sex with Nicholson the night before in a sexual threesome arranged with a mutual lover, enlisted his friend Jacob Anthony Quintanilla to rob Nicholson at his apartment. During the robbery, Nicholson was beaten with a baseball bat brought by Quintanilla, fracturing his skull, prosecutors said. His body was found the next day when a concerned coworker checked on him after he didn’t show up. Dragna’s DNA was found on a trash can, and prosecutors said he tried to sell Nicholson’s Apple laptop and Adobe software online. Public Defender Frank Bittar argued during a December trial that Dragna set up a liaison with Nicholson, didn’t intend to commit a robbery and didn’t see the baseball bat until afterwards. After serving 1,564 days in jail according to public defender Frank Bittar, Dragna’s appearance changed from his 2009 mugshot – heavier, with a shaved head, beard, glasses and a book on his lap. As Stotler told Dragna he’d spend the rest of his life in prison, his face was motionless. Stotler said even if state law didn’t leave Dragna ineligible for parole, “the court would not grant (it) in light of the circumstances and (the defendant’s) prior record.” Stotler referred to a probation officer report “basically indicating” that he was a “career criminal.” Those incidents included felony charges both as a juvenile and an adult – including a 2009 conviction for drug possession and a 2008 conviction for second-degree burglary. Bittar said given the crime, he found the sentence to be “draconian,” cruel and unusual, and potentially violating the 8th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, though he didn’t make a formal motion. “My hands are tied, as I believe, respectfully, the court’s hands are tied,” Bittar said. “Perhaps someday down the road 10 to 15 years from now … someone may find my comments interesting.” Bittar embraced Dragna’s mother Renee after the verdict. She quietly wiped tears away during the proceedings. Bravo said she was happy with the sentence – though Tammy Hileman, a friend for five years and fellow photography student, said she would have preferred the death penalty. Hileman wore cropped pants to the hearing to sport a tattoo she got in Nicholson’s memory – a black ribbon encircled by a rainbow, his birth and death dates and his name. Pink wings stretch out from the ribbon “so he’s in heaven,” Hileman said. She told Bravo before the hearing she’s planning an addition – the words “justice served.” But Hileman and Bravo both said it isn’t over – Quintanilla has a pretrial hearing scheduled March 21 at 9 a.m. in the same courtroom Dragna received his sentence.

Article3.txt,"﻿They terrorized a black child’s party, then cried when a judge read their sentences BY BEN GUARINO The Washington Post    * LINKEDIN    * GOOGLE+    * PINTEREST    * REDDIT    * PRINT    * ORDER REPRINT OF THIS STORY In July 2015, a group of 15 people calling themselves “Respect the Flag” boarded several pickup trucks, each outfitted with Confederate and American flags, and embarked on a drive around Douglasville, Ga., a small city west of Atlanta. Tensions around displaying the Confederate flag were already high. Barely a month had passed since Dylann Roof, the avowed white supremacist who had posed with the Confederate battle flag, killed nine black Americans at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. And the small “Respect the Flag” group went far beyond a display of Confederate pride. Hatred, a Georgia judge said during a sentencing Monday, propelled the group as they descended upon a child’s birthday party and unleashed a storm of death threats and anti-black slurs, and pointed a shotgun. ADVERTISING “Their actions were motivated by racial hatred,” said Judge William McClain, of the Douglas County Superior Court, according to the Associated Press. Georgia legislature does not include a law regarding hate crimes. The 10 men and five women who made up “Respect the Flag” harassed black drivers as well as customers at a Walmart and a convenience store.     Two convicted for racial threats against black people at party sentenced to prison WGCL - Atlanta, GA     Then they happened upon a birthday party being held in Douglasville for an 8-year-old black child. Witnesses told the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit group that tracks hate crimes, that after driving the trucks across the property belonging to the child’s grandmother, the men exited the vehicles. The “Respect the Flag” group began to yell racial epithets and shout death threats. “They even threatened to kill children at the party,” according to a statement issued by Douglas County District Attorney Brian Fortner in early February. One of the men, 26-year-old Jose Ismael Torres, pointed a black pump shotgun at the partygoers, prosecutors said. Several panicked citizens called the police. “Everywhere you went, 911 call centers were flooded with calls,” the judge said, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. “I was scared,” Melissa Alford, the host of the party, told the Southern Poverty Law Center in October, a few days after the group’s members were indicted. “My first thought was if these people start shooting at us, we wouldn’t be able to get all the kids inside the house in time.” The defendants in the case argued that a party attendee triggered the incident by hurling an object at one of the trucks. Cellphone video taken at the scene showed otherwise, the judge said. “If you drive around town with a Confederate flag, yelling the n-word, you know how it’s going to be interpreted,” the judge said, per Atlanta’s Fox 5. “It’s inexplicable to me that you weren’t arrested by the police that day.” The members of the group, two of whom pleaded guilty, were convicted in early February. Following the convictions, the Douglas County district attorney issued a statement clarifying that this case was not an issue of the First Amendment but of harassment. “Many people tried to make the case about simply flying the Confederate battle flag. However, it wasn’t about that at all,” Fortner said in the statement. “Instead, this case was about a group of people riding around our community, drinking alcohol, harassing and intimidating our citizens because of the color of their skin.” The judge handed down the final two sentences on Monday. Torres was sentenced 20 years, serving 13 in prison. The mother of his children, Kayla Rae Norton, 25, was sentenced to 15 years and will serve six. After their prison terms, they will be banished from Douglas County. They were found in violation of Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act; Norton was found guilty of violating the act as well as a count of making terroristic threats. The jury convicted Torres of three counts of aggravated assault, one count of making terroristic threats and one count of violating the act. The scene in the courtroom was an emotional one. Both Torres and Norton cried as their sentences were announced, the Associated Press reported. Norton apologized to the victims. One of the victims, Hyesha Bryant, expressed her forgiveness. “I forgive you,” Bryant said. “And to your family, I’m sorry it had to come this far.”",A local paper,1

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews) NEW YORK | A former journalist fired for fabricating details in stories made at least eight of the scores of threats against Jewish institutions nationwide, including a bomb threat to the Anti-Defamation League, as part of a bizarre campaign to harass and frame his ex-girlfriend, federal officials said Friday. Juan Thompson was arrested in St. Louis and appeared there in federal court Friday on a cyberstalking charge. He politely answered questions and told the judge he had enough money to hire a lawyer. A crowd of supporters who attended said Thompson had no criminal record. His lawyer didn’t comment. ADVERTISING Federal officials have been investigating 122 bomb threats called in to Jewish organizations in three dozen states since Jan. 9 and a rash of vandalism at Jewish cemeteries. Thompson started making threats Jan. 28, a criminal complaint said, with an email to the Jewish History Museum in New York written from an account that made it appear as if it were being sent by an ex-girlfriend. “Juan Thompson put 2 bombs in the History Museum set to go off Sunday,” it said. He followed that up with similar messages to a Jewish school in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and to a school and community center in Manhattan, authorities said. In another round of emails and phone calls, he gave the woman’s name, rather than his own, the court complaint said. The Council on American-Islamic Relations received an anonymous email saying the woman put a bomb in a Dallas Jewish center. Thompson, who’s black, then took to Twitter: “Know any good lawyers?” he wrote. “Need to stop this nasty/racist #whitegirl I dated who sent a bomb threat in my name.” He later tweeted to the Secret Service: “I’m been (sic) tormented by an anti-Semite. She sent an antijewish bomb threat in my name. Help.” But police say it was a hoax created to make the woman look guilty. Thompson also made threats in which he identified the woman as the culprit, authorities said. It’s unclear why Jewish organizations were targeted. Republican President Donald Trump suggested in a meeting Tuesday with state attorneys general the threats against Jewish community centers may have been designed to make “others look bad,” according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Trump also has condemned violence against Jewish organizations. Thompson was fired from the online publication The Intercept last year after being accused of fabricating several quotes and creating fake email accounts to impersonate people, including the Intercept’s editor-in-chief. One of the stories involved Dylann Roof, the white shooter of black worshippers at a Charleston, South Carolina, church. Thompson had written that a cousin named Scott Roof claimed the gunman was angry that a love interest chose a black man over him. A review showed there was no cousin by that name. The story was retracted. The Intercept wrote Friday it was “horrified” to learn of Thompson’s arrest. Thompson had been accused of bizarre behavior before. Doyle Murphy, a reporter at the Riverfront Times, an alternative weekly in St. Louis, said he was subjected to social media harassment after writing about Thompson’s troubled past in the fallout from his firing at The Intercept. Murphy said Thompson set up anonymous accounts on Twitter and other social media posing as a woman who claimed she had been sexually assaulted by Murphy. Murphy said he contacted Twitter but every time one fake account was taken down a new one popped up. He said he contacted police but there was little they could do. “It was a nightmare, and there’s not a whole lot I could do about it,” Murphy said. The Federal Communications Commission said Friday it will grant an emergency waiver allowing Jewish community centers and their phone carriers to track the numbers of callers who make threats, even if the callers try to block the numbers. It said Democratic U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer had requested such a waiver earlier in the week. According to the criminal complaint, Thompson and the ex-girlfriend, a social worker, broke up last summer. The following day, her boss received an email purporting to be from a national news organization saying she’d been pulled over for drunken driving. The harassment got worse, authorities said. She received an anonymous email with nude photos of herself and a threat to release them. Her company, a nonprofit that works to end homelessness, got faxes saying she was anti-Semitic. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children got a note saying she watched child porn. Thompson’s IP address was used for the emails, but he told police his computer had been hacked, the complaint said. The ADL said Thompson had been on its radar since he fabricated the story about Roof. According to ADL research, Thompson also claimed he wanted to dismantle the system of “racial supremacy and greedy capitalism that is stacked against us.” He said he was going to run for mayor of St. Louis to “fight back against Trumpian fascism and socio-economic terrorism.” FBI Director James Comey met with Jewish community leaders Friday to discuss the recent threats, the agency said. University City, Missouri, police Lt. Fredrick Lemons told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that detectives will question Thompson about the 154 headstones toppled last month at a Jewish cemetery there.",A local paper,1

It happens regularly: Someone sees a man with a turban and beard and hurls anti-Muslim slurs his way, or worse. Members of the Sikh religion, like Singh and his wife, also are feeling vulnerable as anti-Islamic sentiment heats up across the U.S., but instead of distancing themselves from Muslims, members of this southeast Asian religion are working with them to combat hateful rhetoric and dispel misconceptions about their respective faiths. (AP Photo/LM Otero) CHICAGO | Pardeep Kaleka spent several days after 9/11 at his father's South Milwaukee gas station, fearing that his family would be targeted by people who assumed they were Muslim. No, Kaleka explained on behalf of his father, who wore a turban and beard and spoke only in broken English, the family was Sikh, a southeast Asian religion based on equality and unrelated to Islam. But amid a new wave of anti-Islamic sentiment since the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Kaleka is vowing to take an entirely different approach. ""For us it does not matter who they're targeting,"" said Kaleka, a former Milwaukee police officer and teacher whose father was one of six people killed in 2012 when a white supremacist opened fire at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. ""This time we cannot differentiate ourselves; when hate rhetoric is being spewed we cannot be on the sidelines."" Across the U.S., Sikhs and Muslims are banding together to defend their respective religions. Someone bent on harming Muslims wouldn't understand — or care — about the distinction between the two faiths, they say, and both also deserve to live in peace. So they plan educational sessions and rallies. They successfully pushed the FBI to track hate crimes against Sikhs. They speak to lawmakers and support each other's legal action, including a lawsuit filed over a New York City police surveillance program targeting New Jersey Muslims. ""We are in this fight together,"" said Gurjot Kaur, a senior staff attorney at The Sikh Coalition, founded the night of Sept. 11. Sikhism, a monotheistic faith, was founded more than 500 years ago in Southeast Asia and has roughly 27 million followers worldwide, most of them in India. There are more than 500,000 Sikhs in the U.S. Male followers often cover their heads with turbans — which are considered sacred — and refrain from shaving their beards. Reports of bullying, harassment and vandalism against Sikhs have risen in recent weeks. Last week, a Sikh temple in Orange County, California, was vandalized, as was a truck in the parking lot by someone who misspelled the word ""Islam"" and made an obscene reference to ISIS. A Sikh woman said she recently was forced to show her breast pump before taking her seat on an airplane in Minneapolis because another passenger thought she might be a terrorist. Several Sikh football fans said they initially were not allowed into Qualcomm Stadium to watch the San Diego Chargers game against the Denver Broncos last Sunday because several of them were wearing turbans. Schoolchildren say they've been bullied. For most Sikhs, much of the backlash has been frequent stares or comments and occasional online insults. Former NCAA basketball player Darsh Singh said he has heard insults throughout his life, including recently when someone recently yelled ""Osama!"" at him as he was crossing a street in Phoenix. Then last week, a photo making the rounds on Facebook showed the former Trinity University basketball player — the first turbaned Sikh to play in the NCAA — with the caption: ""Nobody wants to guard Muhammad, he's too explosive."" A friend came to his defense with a lengthy post —saying, ""do the world a favor and educate yourself"" — which got tens of thousands of likes. ""A lot of people act out of fear or ignorance,"" said Singh. ""I don't know who started it, but whoever they are, I forgive them."" Rajinder Singh Mago, community outreach director at the Sikh Religious Society of Chicago, said it's more difficult for Sikh schoolchildren who sometimes are bullied. ""Ninety-nine percent of Americans are good ... then that one person who just came out of a tavern after a few beers, you don't know what he's thinking at that point,"" Mago said. Madihha Ahussain, a staff attorney at the national group Muslim Advocates, said people who are misinformed about both religions not only are ""blaming entire faith communities, now they're blaming multiple groups for the acts of a couple individuals."" As a result, some Sikhs have encountered violence. A Chicago-area teenager was charged with a hate crime after a September road rage incident in which he called 53-year-old Sikh taxi driver Inderjit Mukker ""Bin Laden"" and repeatedly hit him in the face, breaking his cheekbone. In 2013, a Green Bay, Wisconsin, man was charged with a hate crime for allegedly setting fire to a convenience store owned by a Sikh-American. That was less than a year after white supremacist Wade Michael Page killed six people and wounded four others at the Oak Creek temple. Kaleka said his father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, was the last person killed inside the temple, after Page broke into an office where the elder Kaleka was calling 911. Kaleka said the Muslim community reached out to Sikhs in the aftermath, and members of both faiths — along with Christians, Jews and others — are continuing to work together to combat inflammatory rhetoric. Last weekend, he spoke at a Muslim women's coalition. ""I think this is just another test and, unfortunately, I think as bad as the comments are from some politicians, it does surface some underlying issues we haven't addressed,"" in this country, he said.",A local paper,1

http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/fall-lisa-phillips-lapd-officer-remembers-day-riots/story?id=46756769,"In 1989, the year Lisa Phillips got her badge, she was one of only a handful of women in her graduating class with the Los Angeles Police Department.  Phillips said that back then, she was living two lives: one, as openly gay; and the other, as a police officer who shared little to nothing of her personal life. In April 1992, the 33-year-old Phillips was assigned to the 77th division in South Central, Los Angeles, and was on foot patrol with her partner when riots broke out following the acquittals of four white police officers in the Rodney King beating trial. Disobeying retreat orders, they entered the fray to rescue an Asian woman from a brutal attack.  ""Let It Fall: LA 1982-1992,"" an ABC News documentary television event, airs April 28 at 9 p.m. (8 p.m. central), marking the 25th anniversary of the L.A. uprising.  In an interview for the documentary ""Let It Fall,” Phillips shared her memories from 1992, and discussed her personal journey and experiences as a female officer. The following are excerpts, in her own words.  EARLY YEARS  I grew up in Maryland and-- back in those days, in the '70s-- it was beautiful. Horse country. Farms. Lots of open roads… But the attitudes were still very backwards for me. Not a whole lot of African Americans around. Not a whole lot of any other-- anybody else's-- but whites around, honestly.  I didn't know what to call it because back then you didn't say ""gay"" -- it was either ""homosexual,"" or ""queer,"" or ""faggot,"" or ""dyke.” … But I acted as if it wasn't there because-- who are you gonna tell? Who are you gonna talk to in 1972? You know? In the '70s-- homosexuality wasn't really discussed… I acted straight. I had a boyfriend. I knew it wasn't me. But at the same it wasn't really-- it didn't feel like there was an alternative.  I played the part until I realized that my mom's brother was gay. And he lived in California. And for my getting out of high school he said, ""Why don't you come to LA and stay with me for the summer?"" I said, ""Okay."" And I came to Los Angeles, North Hollywood, and he introduced me to this whole community of gay people.  After this experience…I said, ""There's no way I can go back to Maryland… and pretend to be straight anymore.” I saved my money for two years bartending. And in two years-- I packed up a couple of suitcases, got on a plane, and moved to LA.  LOS ANGELES  LA symbolized freedom to me. Moving to California-- I moved because I felt stifled and oppressed in Maryland. Even though I loved my friends and family-- leaving my mom and dad was-- I still can see it-- remember crying at the airport. But I knew I needed to go a place where I could feel free, where I could be me and not worry as much about being beaten up, or called a dyke, or, you know, being chased down an alley -- so it represented freedom and openness and a place where I could be embraced as who I was  It was 1987 and I was 28. When I discovered West Hollywood it was like, ""What? Are you kidding me?!” It was amazing. It was like Disneyland.  I never thought about being a cop…I was bartending and the LAPD was heavily recruiting. I heard a radio ad. And I sort of laughed and went, ""Ha ha ha. That's funny."" But then I thought about it and I thought, ""Okay, you're almost 30… What are you gonna do?”  BECOMING A COP  I thought, ""Well, I'll just take the written test, just to see what it's about.” And I went down and I took it and I passed. They signed me up for an oral interview. And the background was very extensive. And all of a sudden I get a letter in the mail, like, seven months later. ""We're offering you a position in the-- in the May, 1989, class.""  My academy was seven months… it's the hardest thing I've ever done and the most rewarding. In my class, I believe there were eight or nine women. On the whole department, there were about six percent women… I knew that I'd have to work three times as hard to be accepted. The feeling at the time, in most police departments, was women didn't belong on the job.  The LAPD at the time was a little bit of a boy's club. It was mostly men. It was mostly white men… But I was really lucky. I was accepted. I saw some other women that weren't accepted as easily as I was.  At that stage it was two different lives… being openly gay and had been since '77 and here it was 12 years later living as an openly gay women going into an atmosphere where they were no openly gay police officers. I knew I had to pick my timing. 1989 wasn't the time. At home I was out. But at work…I couldn't tell 'em, you know, I had a lover that was a girl. No way.  LAPD was still using oppressive tactics with gay people in the '80s…Gay people were still being talked about in derogatory terms amongst officers. Our chief at the time, Daryl Gates, very anti-gay. ‘I'll never have a queer working on my department.’ And that's what he said. And that's documented… And I thought, ""Well, little do you know, chief, you got a lot of 'em. We're just not out yet.""  UNDERSTANDING FEAR OF POLICE  Being a white police officer working in a neighborhood, be it Rampart or South Central, where the majority was not white-- I never felt particularly uneasy about it. I was called a lot of things. But so what? You know. Somebody called me a white devil once. I got called dyke. I got called-- a blue eyed devil. I'm like, 'I don't have blue eyes.' I would say back to 'em. Pig. Cracker. You know, terms that hearken back to the slave days. You know, the history of that. The whip. I understood it though.  I understood the animosity towards police. I understood the fear of police. And I understood it because I was gay I think…I understood what the gay community had gone through. So I understood the fear that another minority community had with police. So I wasn't angry at them for being angry at me or for not trusting me. I kind of got it. It didn't stop me from doing my job, whatever it is that I had to do, but it gave me a deeper understanding of where their anger might be coming from…. So, yeah, I had empathy. I understood, to a degree-- what their feelings were. ‘Cause I had felt them as a gay person.  THE RODNEY KING TRIAL  Boy, it was a tense time being a cop during the Rodney King trial. The African American community was up in arms. They were pissed off. And they had a right to be to a certain extent. It was a very dangerous time to be a police officer. It felt dangerous. You could feel the tension. I could feel the tension when I went to work. You could feel the hostility in the air. You could feel it every time you got a call. And back then we were answering 30 radios calls-- one car handling 30 radio calls in an eight hour day. Maybe more than that. That's just one car out of maybe eight or nine cars working in a division. And back then we only had, like, 7,000 cops.  APRIL 29, 1992  The day of the verdicts my partner and I were walking our foot beat like we did every day on Vermont. And we had this one shop that sold TV-- a TV repair shop. Really nice guy… a black fellow. And-- he was always friendly to us and we were friendly to them. We knew at 3:00 pm that the verdicts were gonna be read. So we planned on being at this repair shop. And we were on foot and our car was parked a few blocks away. You know, and we were mindful. The air was thick. You know, you could feel it. So at 3:00 pm we're standing around on the sidewalk with a couple of other people. We were watching the news. They started announcing the verdicts. Not guilty. Not guilty. More people started coming up because it was-- you know, the thing to do ‘cause he always had his TVs on.  And more people started coming. And as they read the fourth not guilty people were going, 'Oh, hell no. No way.' The whole mood-- it was already thick, but people were, 'Hey, Phillips… What's going on, boss?' to, you know, 'Oh, hell no.'"" It was an anger. You could feel it. You could hear it. You could sense it. It was palpable. It was thick. It was there. And my partner and I looked at each other and we were like, ‘Man, we gotta get to our car.’  And we were the only two cops there. 'F---in pig.' I mean, it was-- they were infuriated. And they knew us… A lot of 'em knew us. But they didn't know us then. We were just cops then. We were just pigs then. We were the bad guy.  And we said, 'Let's go.' And we ran, we literally jogged back to our police car 'cause people were turning on us now. So we went back to our police car and…some violence started occurring. And the officers tried to arrest this guy. And so we started responding-- and they put out a backup call.  Well, we knew there was a high probability or possibility that we might get attacked… I was part of the problem. I wasn't Officer Phillips anymore. I was a f---ing cop. ""You f---g pig."" That's what I was. And I got it. I got it. I mean, I understood it, but ""I'm going home. I'm not standing here anymore.”  And you could hear calls starting to come out. The radio got very busy with you know, 911 calls. It was starting to come unhinged. The train was coming off the tracks. You could feel it….  71st ST. & NORMANDIE FLASHPOINT  I think that was the 71st and Normandie event when the crowd tried to take this guy back from the police... And then the crowd got bigger. And the police got bigger. And then it sort of became this self-feeding frenzy-- us against them kind of thing on both sides. We were woefully understaffed. There were many more of them than us. And that's why Lt. Moulin had to make the decision he made initially to pull us back and wait for more people. Except more people weren't coming.  And it started, like, spreading out throughout the community… Every corner we turned there were ten more people, ten more people, 20 more people-- I mean, it just grew, and grew, and grew, it was, like I don't even know how to describe it…  The radio was putting out calls, like, the-- the radio operator couldn't speak quick enough to get her calls out. And these weren't calls, like, shoplifting. These were assault with deadly weapon, robbery in progress, assault with deadly weapon in progress, looting in progress. I mean, these were all code three calls, which are the highest priority-- lights and siren calls.  We knew we were all ordered not to go back to this area of Florence and Normandie because it had become completely unhinged. Hundreds and hundreds of people looting, burning buildings, smashing windows, stealing merchandise, anybody that wasn't black was getting their ass kicked.  THE RESCUE  My best memory is—“AWD in progress. 51st and Normandie. Asian woman being beaten to death in her car or assaulted in her car by a mob of 20 people.” Something like that. The call came out and it sort of hung there in the air with all the other calls. And we just said, 'Man, we can't-- we gotta go.”  And then we said, 'Well, what are the repercussions if we don't go? Somebody might die. We-- we gotta go.' [My partner’s] like, “Okay, we gotta go. You're driving.” And off we went. And we turned around -- one of us said, “I know we're gonna get in trouble for this.” And we said, “Well, whatever.'...""  As we got to Florence and Normandie the liquor store was on fire… We're getting attacked and surrounded with rocks, and bottles, and people. And there's hundreds of people. We're looking for our victim.  But I thought as we're driving there, “Man, I don't know. I don't know if we're gonna make it. It's just us. There's no other cops around.” My partner says, “I want you to call my wife if I get killed because you're my partner. I don't want somebody that she doesn't know to come knocking on the door.” I go, “All right. I'll call your wife.” And I thought, “I've got a lover, you know, at home. And nobody knows that she exists. Who's gonna tell her what if — who's gonna call my mom or my girlfriend?” I said, “Partner, look, I'm gay. You probably figured it out. But I'm coming out to you. I've got-- a lover' ”will you call her if something happens to me?' And-- he said, “Don't worry.” He said, “Partner, I got your back.” I said, “All right, I love you. Let's go.”  There was, like, 20 guys. And they scattered. Except one guy… One guy was leaning in the driver side and he had this woman by the collar. And he was beating the sh-t out of her. Punch-- punching her.  She was still seat belted in. She was bloody, unconscious. We thought she was dead….At that point I said, “We gotta get out of this car” Now we're being attacked now. We've got rocks and bottles coming at us. The glass is all in the street. I remember stepping out of the car and hearing the glass crunch under my boots.  He's running back to the car with this woman in his arms. We're being attacked, yelled at, screamed at. A rock or a bottle or something hits him in the back and he goes down in the street-- knocks him down. The woman rolls-- flies out of his arms into all this glass. I'll never forget when he fell. The crowd laughed. I'll never forget that my whole life. “OH, stupid f---kin' -- you know, whatever they were saying “pigs”. And I always thought to myself, “This is man's inhumanity to man right here. This is just-- this is what it's all about. This is the worst of the worst.” So I thought the woman was dead. I go to my partner—“Get up. Get up. Get up.” And he got up. We ran back up to the woman. He picked up an arm and a leg, I picked up an arm and a leg. And there's nowhere for the car to go. We don't have an exit. We don't have an escape route. There's nowhere to go.  My partner's eyes locked with somebody's in the crowd. I'm not sure how it all happened. But some people stepped aside and created a space big enough to let our car go through. It was either-- a beautiful thing or a self-preservation thing. I prefer to believe that it was-- it's something in their soul that they said, “We gotta let these people go.” And we got her into a room in the emergency room. And she came to and we realized, “Oh, thank goodness. She's not dead.”  POLICE RESPONSIBILITY  We didn't have anything good to say about the chain of command, meaning captains and above. They're the guys who dropped the ball in the first place. We gave them enough information where they should've had us ready to go. We should've been maximum deployed, as many cops working as possible, and ready to go.  Gates blamed Lt. Moulin, and I remember being angry about that because Lt. Moulin was a good guy. The blame was laid on him for losing control at the onset and therefore probably the blame for the whole riots. I think that's completely ludicrous, wrong, and irresponsible. I think Chief Gates is the one who should've stepped up and taken responsibility. And I think Moulin was a good Lieutenant and he fell on the sword. And he lost his career. And he shouldn't have. So I was very, very angry about that.  'L.A. FOUR'  There were periods of time throughout history in LA where white cops treated black guys bad, Hispanics bad, women bad, gay people bad-- a whole bunch of minorities bad. So I understand the anger. What I don't understand is the reaction with violence.  MEDAL OF VALOR  The board recommended that my partner and I receive the Medal of Valor for saving this woman's life, which was an honor. I think I was the sixth woman in the history of the department to be awarded that, which was a big deal for women. So I took advantage of the opportunity as a gay cop, too. 'Cause at that time there were only six cops [in the Department] who had come out as a group. And the press was all over me 'cause I was the only woman to win it that year. And I said, ""Well, there's one more thing."" I said, ""I'm also-- a gay cop. And I'm coming out right now on the LAPD to you as an openly gay cop."" And it was a very proud moment for me. And I'll never forget that 'cause it changed the course of a lot of things.  TRAILBLAZING  It changed the course of how the LAPD eventually dealt with the gay community. We pushed for many things after that. I became the first gay and lesbian liaison in the department's history. So I did a lot of work within the gay community. Worked at the Gay and Lesbian Center. Opened up a drop-in center for LAPD for victims of hate crimes, and marched in the parade for the first time as a group of openly gay officers.  We started and have continued to build a really good bridge of understanding between the gay community and the LAPD. We have affected a lot of police departments: Houston, Dallas, Orlando, Key West, Chicago. I got to go to the White House and work with President Clinton to rewrite the hate crimes, how we handle them as a department. I'm very proud of what I've done on the job.  April 29th, 1992, changed my life for the better without a doubt. I went through a lot-- a lotta scratching and clawing, and I walked the plank many a time. When I was driving with my partner and I came out to him-- doing that-- it changed my life. And in so many ways, it empowered me to not be afraid, to speak up when I felt I needed to speak up. If something was wrong that I had the courage to say,  ""Hey, wait. That's wrong.""  To not accept that homophobic joke anymore. To not accept that black joke… It gave me the power to speak up and do what I needed to do to try and make it a little bit better place. It made me stronger as a person.",abcnews.com,1
 http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/friend-convicted-church-shooter-begins-serving-sentence-47080824,"A friend with whom convicted church shooter Dylann Roof shared his plans to massacre South Carolina churchgoers has begun serving more than two years in prison for lying to federal authorities.  Joey Meek reported to Elkton Federal Correction Institution in Lisbon, Ohio, on Tuesday, attorney Debbie Barbier told The Associated Press on Friday. Elkton is a low-security facility with just over 2,300 inmates about 80 miles (129 kilometers) southeast of Cleveland, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons website.  Prosecutors have said that Roof told Meek, 22, during a night of vodka, cocaine, marijuana and video games that he was planning to kill black people at a Charleston church during an evening Bible study.  Meek told authorities he thought his childhood friend was all talk until a week later, when news broke of a deadly shooting rampage at Charleston's Emanuel AME Church. But instead of calling authorities, Meek talked another friend out of going to police and giving them Roof's name, and then lied to the FBI about his conversation with Roof.  Meek was not charged for failing to tell police about the impending attack since that is not a crime under federal law. Instead, he was prosecuted for stopping a friend immediately after the slaughter from calling the police to report Roof as a suspect, actions a judge said delayed Roof's capture for hours, during which Roof easily could have killed more people somewhere else.  Roof, 23, was convicted on 33 federal charges, including hate crimes, and sentenced to death earlier this year. A plea deal on state murder charges in exchange for life sentences wrapped up the prosecutions against him, and he was transferred to federal death row in Terre Haute, Indiana, last week.  Unlike Roof, a self-avowed white supremacist who told jurors in his closing argument he still felt he had to carry out the slaughter, Meek showed remorse for his crimes, sending each victim's family a handwritten letter of apology and pointing out traits he admired in their loved ones. Meek cried last month as he told a sentencing judge he feared retribution behind bars from people angry with Roof.  ""I don't know if I'll make it out of prison alive,"" Meek said.

 http://abcnews.go.com/US/fresno-shooting-suspect-charged-counts-murder-racially-motivated/story?id=47060725,"Kori Ali Muhammad was charged Wednesday with three counts of first-degree murder in what prosecutors have described as a racially motivated shooting spree.  Muhammad, 39, is accused of going on a rampage that left three people dead in downtown Fresno, California, on April 18. His arraignment on the three murders, which was scheduled for today, has been delayed until May 12 for a psychological evaluation, according to ABC-owned station KFSN-TV  Prosecutors said Muhammad was also charged Wednesday with three counts of attempted murder for the individuals he shot at but didn't hit, one count of shooting at an occupied vehicle and one count of possession of a firearm, according to a press release from the Fresno County District Attorney's Office.  According to ABC-owned station KGO-TV, police said Muhammad told investigators he wanted to kill as many white people as possible, laughing as he explained his actions.  ""Kori Muhammad is not a terrorist, but he is a racist,"" Fresno Police Dept. Chief Jerry Dyer said, KGO-TV reported.  The victims of the April 18 shooting rampage have been identified as 37-year-old Mark Gassett, 34-year-old Zackary Randalls and 58-year-old David Jackson.  Muhammad is separately charged in the murder of a security guard outside a motel on April 13, as well as the attempted murder of another security guard that same day. He fled the scene afterward, police said. Once Muhammad learned he was wanted for murder, he told investigators, he decided to go on the April 18 shooting spree.  Muhammad allegedly fired at multiple people over the course of four minutes before police were able to take him into custody, according to the Los Angeles Times.  Police told ABC News that the handgun used in the shooting spree has still not been recovered. There is no indication that others were involved in plotting the shooting spree, police said.  According to the press release, Muhammad faces a death sentence or life in prison if convicted.  Muhammad is being represented by Eric Christensen from the Public Defender’s Office. Muhammad has not yet entered a plea to any of the charges against him and criminal proceedings against him have been suspended pending the outcome of the psychological evaluation.",abcnews.com,1
 http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/florida-governor-actions-legal-fight-prosecutor-47059919,"A prosecutor is wrong in arguing that Florida's governor violated the state constitution when he took away almost two dozen cases from her office after she announced she'd no longer seek the death penalty, Gov. Rick Scott and Florida's Attorney General argued in court documents filed Thursday.  Florida's governors have had the authority to transfer cases for 112 years, even after Florida's prosecutors went from being appointed to being elected by voters, according to a motion filed with the Florida Supreme Court by Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi.  State Attorney Aramis Ayala, whose district covers Orlando, is challenging the governor's orders transferring almost two dozen death-penalty cases from her office to another prosecutor. Ayala's challenge is being heard before the Florida Supreme Court.  The controversy started last month when Ayala said her office would no longer seek the death penalty since the process was costly and dragged on for the victims' relatives.  Scott responded by reassigning the cases to State Attorney Brad King in a neighboring district.  Ayala said the governor had no authority to do so and that his actions challenged the prosecutorial decision-making of Florida's state attorneys, as well as violated Florida's Constitution.  But the governor said in his response that Ayala previously had requested six non-death-penalty cases to be reassigned to King, primarily because of conflicts of interest in her office. Those requests are difficult to reconcile with Ayala's current position, Scott said.  ""Ayala's letters and email requesting that the six cases be reassigned did not express any doubts concerning the governor's statutory or constitutional authority to order the requested reassignments,"" said the response by the governor and attorney general.  If they followed Ayala's argument on the death penalty, prosecutors around the state could say they don't agree with other laws, such as hate crimes enhancements or campaign finance regulations, and decide not to enforce the laws, the governor and attorney general said.",abcnews.com,1
 http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/korean-presidential-hopeful-accused-anti-gay-comments-47022154,"South Korean presidential front-runner Moon Jae-in outraged persecuted sexual minority groups by saying during a television debate that he opposes homosexuality, something his supporters say he had to do to win office in the deeply conservative country.  Moon, a liberal candidate and former human rights lawyer, made the comments Tuesday night while responding to a conservative presidential candidate who argued gay soldiers were weakening the country's military.  Gay rights advocates, some of whom who were dragged away after approaching Moon following a speech at the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday, see Moon's words as hate speech. Police said 13 activists were detained at the scene of Moon's speech on suspicion of violating laws that ban protests inside the gates of the legislature.  Moon's supporters defended his comments as in line with many South Koreans' views. Moon's camp didn't immediately respond to the criticism by gay rights activists.  Sexual minorities are harshly stigmatized in South Korea and struggle with political visibility because a powerful Christian lobby keeps politicians from passing anti-discrimination laws. Among the five candidates who participated in the debate, only Sim Sang-jung, representing the minor Justice Party, openly advocates gay rights.  After the conservative candidate, Hong Joon-pyo, argued that gay soldiers were weakening the country's military, Moon said he agreed.  Hong then asked Moon whether he opposed homosexuality, to which Moon replied, ""I oppose."" When Hong double-checked, Moon said, ""Of course.""  Hong represents the party of ousted President Park Geun-hye, who was arrested last month and now faces the prospect of a prison term over corruption charges.  He recently angered female voters over revelations in a 2005 memoir that he assisted a friend in a failed date rape attempt as a teen. The incident involved mixing the woman's drink with a livestock stimulant, Hong wrote.  A watchdog has recently accused South Korea's military of hunting down and prosecuting gay servicemen. That raised worries of more discrimination and hate crimes against sexual minorities.  Moon later in the debate said that he opposed ""discrimination based on homosexuality,"" but was also against legalizing same-sex marriage.  ""Moon needs to offer an apology and a correction of his comments made on live television,"" said Jung Yol, a gay rights activist. ""What he said was clearly hate speech, and since he is the candidate favored to win the election, his words can influence how people think.""  Lawyers for a Democratic Society, a group of South Korean human rights lawyers to which Moon once belonged, issued a statement denouncing the comments by Moon and Hong, saying the candidates revealed their ignorance on human and constitutional rights.  ""We cannot look away from the issue as the candidates' comments could encourage hate speech and discrimination against social minorities across the society,"" the statement said.  South Korea's Constitutional Court formally removed Park from office on March 10. That triggered a 60-day presidential race. Opinion surveys favor Moon to win the May 9 election.",abcnews.com,1
 http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/gop-senator-regrets-guy-tutu-kind-asks-47018032,"A Republican senator from Wyoming said Tuesday he regrets his poor choice of words after telling students a man who wears a tutu to a bar and gets into fights ""kind of asks for it.""  Sen. Mike Enzi said in a statement that his comments at Greybull High School and Middle School last week were about respect, tolerance and the dangers of bullying.  ""I regret a poor choice of words during part of my presentation,"" Enzi said. ""None of us is infallible and I apologize to anyone who has taken offense. No offense was intended. Quite the opposite in fact, and so I ask for your understanding as well.""  The Huffington Post reported the comments Tuesday, quoting Greybull Standard editor Mathew Burciaga, who attended the event. In an audio recording Burciaga provided to The Associated Press, a high school student asks Enzi what work he's doing to improve the life of the LGBT community in Wyoming.  ""We always say that in Wyoming you can be just about anything you want to be, as long as you don't push it in somebody's face,"" Enzi says. ""I know a guy that wears a tutu and goes to bars on Friday night and is always surprised that he gets in fights. Well, he kind of asks for it a little bit. But that's the way that he winds up with that kind of problem.""  Enzi adds that ""the biggest thing that we need is civility"" and that laws aren't always the answer.  Enzi spokesman Max D'Onofrio pointed out that Enzi also spoke to the students about ""the importance of respecting other people and how it is incumbent on those in the communities we live in to treat others as you would want to be treated.""  Asked about the comments, Enzi's office originally released a statement from the senator saying all people should be treated with respect and condemning bullying and hatred. Shortly after, the office released the second statement from Enzi saying he regretted his poor choice of words.  ""No person, including LGBT individuals, should feel unsafe in their community,"" Enzi said in the second statement.  In 1998, gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard was killed after being beaten, tied to a fence and left for dead. His slaying became a rallying cry in the gay rights movement and a federal hate crimes law now bears his name.  ——  Gruver reported from Cheyenne, Wyoming.",abcnews.com,1
 http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/report-nyc-subway-bias-crimes-felony-assaults-increase-47004373,"Transit officials say anti-Semitic graffiti incidents are the top subway bias crime investigated so far this year by the New York Police Department.  The Daily News ( http://nydn.us/2oG3QyR ) reports that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Transit Bureau says 22 of 31 hate crimes that have happened in the subway system this year targeted Jews. Most of the incidents have involved graffiti.  The report to the MTA board says there were only seven bias crimes committed during the same period last year.  Transit police say each case gets an investigation from a captain or a higher ranking officer, but it's sometimes difficult to make arrests. The anti-Semitic graffiti on subway cars and in stations has included swastikas and comments that advocate the killing of Jews.  Officials say felony assault cases and grand larcenies have also increased this year.  ———  Information from: Daily News, http://www.nydailynews.com",abcnews.com,1
 http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/germany-sees-rise-offenses-hate-crimes-46980286,"Violent crimes in Germany with far-right motives rose 14.3 percent last year after a bigger increase in 2015, and the country also saw another increase in hate crimes, authorities said Monday.  The Interior Ministry said that 1,698 violent right-wing crimes were recorded in 2016, up from 1,485 the previous year. In 2015, the figure soared as Germany saw a large influx of migrants.  There was a 3.6 percent increase last year in the broader category of ""hate crimes"" — offenses of a racist or anti-Semitic nature or targeting people because of their religion, often in online posts. They increased to 10,751 from 10,373 after surging in 2015.  Violent politically motivated crimes targeting homes for asylum-seekers were close to the previous year's level — 169, compared with 177 in 2015. Including non-violent crimes such as cases involving propaganda, the total number of offenses against asylum centers slipped to 995 from 1,031.  Violent crimes with a far-left motive dropped by a quarter in 2016 to 1,702 — a fall that was apparently due to a lack of major politically sensitive events in Germany last year.  However, politically motivated offenses by foreigners rose by two-thirds last year, largely because of the conflict between Turkey and the outlawed PKK.",abcnews.com,1
 http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/report-us-cases-anti-semitism-increased-year-46976815,"The Anti-Defamation League found an increase in cases of anti-Semitic intimidation and vandalism last year, evidence that anti-Jewish bias intensified during the election.  The Jewish civil rights group found 1,266 cases of anti-Semitic harassment last year, compared to 941 in 2015 and 912 in 2014. The increase continued into the first three months of this year, with reports of 541 incidents compared to 291 in the same period the year before, according to the ADL data released Monday.  The preliminary 2017 numbers include a wave of more than 150 bomb threats that started in January against Jewish community centers and day schools. Authorities arrested an Israeli Jewish hacker who they said was behind the harassment. The ADL insists those threats should still be considered anti-Semitic since Jews were the target. During the same period, a former journalist in St. Louis was also charged with threatening Jewish organizations as part of a bizarre campaign to intimidate his former girlfriend. But authorities believe the Israeli man is primarily responsible.  Even without those bomb threats, the number of anti-Jewish incidents this January, February and March in the report would be higher than the year before.  The FBI compiles annual hate-crime statistics, but the 2016 numbers aren't expected to be released until the end of this year. The ADL tally includes a much broader array of incidents, such as distribution of hateful materials, threats, slurs, intimidation and vandalism, along with physical assaults. The organization says its researchers evaluate reports from individuals, community leaders and law enforcement.  This latest compilation includes only a few cases of online harassment — incidents that led to ""on the ground"" intimidation — so that the organization can continue making year-to-year comparisons of ADL data going back to the group's first report in 1979, before the internet and social media were so broadly used, according to Oren Segal, director of the ADL Center on Extremism.  Anti-Semitic harassment in the U.S. has been at historic lows in recent years, according to the organization. In some prior years, the number of incidents surpassed 1,500 or 2,000, Segal said. But the recent uptick has fueled anxiety among American Jews during a period of emboldened expressions of white-supremacism and white-nationalism during the presidential election. Last week, a Jewish woman sued the founder of the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, accusing the publisher of orchestrating a barrage of anti-Semitic messages from anonymous internet trolls starting last December.  ""I think the pace in which the incidents are happening, the speed at which the spike is occurring, I think the historic low is a thing of the past,"" Segal said.  The report linked 34 cases last year to the presidential race, including graffiti found in Denver last May that said ""Kill the Jews, Vote Trump."" ADL chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt was among the most vocal Jewish leaders pressing Donald Trump, as a candidate and president, to do more to combat anti-Semitism, including among his supporters. Critics, in the Jewish community and elsewhere, said partisanship was behind such pressure on Trump. In February, Trump opened his address to Congress with a strong condemnation of recent cases of vandalism at Jewish cemeteries.  On college campuses last year, the number of reports of anti-Semitic incidents remained about the same compared to the previous year, the ADL said. Many of the schools have been roiled in recent years by protests over Israeli policies toward Palestinians. However, the organization saw an increase in the number of reports of harassment against Jewish school children from elementary age through high school.",abcnews.com,1
