https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/choate-life-trustees-resign-sex-abuse.html,"Two former headmasters who were life trustees at Choate Rosemary Hall stepped down this week, forced aside by allegations that teachers at the school had sexually abused students for decades and that administrators had not responded appropriately. The two trustees were Charles Dey, who served as headmaster at the elite Connecticut boarding school from 1973 to 1991, and Edward Shanahan, who held that position from 1991 to 2011. Choate released a report this month from investigators at the law firm Covington & Burling that named 12 former faculty members who it said had abused students in cases dating back to the 1960s. One teacher was said to have raped a student while on a school trip in Costa Rica. Another used a girl’s disciplinary issues to pressure her to have sex with him repeatedly, the report said. For many years, administrators at the school largely responded to reports of misconduct by trying to keep them quiet. In some cases, administrators decided that accused faculty members could remain at Choate. Other teachers were forced out, but none of the episodes were reported to the authorities until 2010, even though Connecticut educators have been legally required to report suspected abuse since 1967. Because the accusations were never reported, teachers suspected of misconduct were able to move on to work at other schools. Much of the abuse documented by investigators occurred while Mr. Dey and Mr. Shanahan were in charge, and many alumni have called for their removal from their positions. Mr. Dey resigned on Thursday and Mr. Shanahan resigned on Friday. In a statement, Lorraine S. Connelly, a Choate spokeswoman, thanked Mr. Shanahan and Mr. Dey “for their contributions to the school” and said, “we believe their resignations are important steps in our community’s healing process.” The news of their resignations was first reported by The Record-Journal in Connecticut. The report released by Choate, which documented misconduct claims in detail, marked a sharp departure from the way the school had handled such issues in the past. Reached by phone, Mr. Dey said he was ""proud of the school, in terms of what they have done and the way they have approached it.” In a lengthy statement, his first since the Choate report was released, Mr. Shanahan said Friday that he was “heartbroken” to read about what some students had experienced at the school while he was its headmaster. “The burden I personally carry is that children were harmed by faculty during my tenure, for which I am deeply, deeply sorry, and the only consolation I have is that, as a result of this report, future incidents like these will be far less likely to occur, and survivors will feel more enabled to come forward for the support they deserve,” Mr. Shanahan said. “Thank you for the privilege of serving you for 20 years. Would that I had done it better.” ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/senator-menendez-corruption-case.html,"A Florida eye doctor was convicted on Friday of running a vast scheme to defraud Medicare of more than $90 million in a case that could have significant ramifications for Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey. The doctor, Salomon E. Melgen, a prominent ophthalmologist, has been the longtime political benefactor of Mr. Menendez, a Democrat. Both face federal corruption charges in an unrelated case scheduled to go on trial in September in Newark. The senator is accused of trading political favors for free trips on the doctor’s private jet, lavish vacations to his resort home in the Dominican Republic and a stay at a five-star hotel in Paris. A jury in Palm Beach County, Fla., found Dr. Melgen guilty on all 67 counts of Medicare fraud, and according to prosecutors in the case, he could spend at least 15 years in prison. The conviction and the sentence he now faces could increase pressure on Dr. Melgen to cooperate with the authorities in the case against Mr. Menendez, his co-defendant in their pending trial. After he is sentenced in the Florida case in July, Dr. Melgen, if he should choose to cooperate, could seek to have that sentence reduced. A provision of federal law allows a judge, upon a motion by the government, to reduce a defendant’s sentence if the defendant is found to have provided “substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.” A lawyer for Dr. Melgen in the Florida trial, Kirk Ogrosky, said the doctor views the two cases as completely separate. “It will have no impact on what will happen in New Jersey,” Mr. Ogrosky said in a phone interview. “He intends to go to trial in New Jersey in September, and nothing about the Florida case changes that.” A lawyer for Mr. Menendez said that the senator was “saddened for his longtime friend” but that the conviction in Florida would have “no bearing” on the bribery charges against his client. “This verdict will have no impact on him,” the lawyer, Abbe David Lowell, said in a statement. “Dr. Melgen’s case focused solely on the day-to-day operations of his medical practice and the private care of his patients — specifics of which the senator could not be aware, nor has it ever been suggested otherwise.” Mr. Menendez and Dr. Melgen have pleaded not guilty to the bribery charges, and Mr. Menendez has spent two years aggressively fighting them. They have been close friends since the 1990s, and the bribery charges revolve around their relationship. Dr. Melgen gave $700,000 through his company, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants, to the Senate Majority PAC, a so-called super PAC to support Senate Democrats, and instructed that the contributions aid Mr. Menendez’s 2012 re-election campaign. For the help Mr. Menendez received, prosecutors contend, the senator urged the Obama administration to alter the Medicare reimbursement policy in a way that would make millions for Dr. Melgen. In 2012 alone, Dr. Melgen received $21 million in Medicare reimbursements. In addition, prosecutors said, Mr. Menendez tried to push a port security deal that involved Dr. Melgen and worked to obtain United States travel visas for the doctor’s foreign girlfriends. Mr. Menendez was rewarded for his help, according to prosecutors, and received free trips on Dr. Melgen’s jet and spent three nights in an executive suite in Paris for a trip valued at nearly $5,000. After an ethics complaint was filed against Mr. Menendez for not reporting trips to the Dominican Republic as gifts, he wrote a $58,500 check to reimburse Dr. Melgen’s company. Federal investigators started to look into Dr. Melgen’s billings to Medicare because he was charging a significantly higher rate for a medication to treat macular degeneration than his peers were. The government said he billed for one vial of the medicine for each patient when he had in fact used one vial to treat three or four patients. Mr. Menendez came under federal scrutiny when he sought to help Dr. Melgen in the billing dispute, calling the Medicare director at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2009 and mentioning it at a meeting with the acting administrator in 2012.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-joseph-ponte-jails-rikers.html,"What has become a familiar defense for Mayor Bill de Blasio when he faces ethical questions about his behavior or that of officials in his administration can be boiled down to a simple, grade-school rejoinder: They said I could. Mr. de Blasio said as much in response to inquiries about his fund-raising practices that attracted state and federal scrutiny, about a political nonprofit he created to advocate for his policies, and about the designation of certain outside advisers — mostly friends and former campaign workers — as “agents of the city” whose communications he argued should be immune from public disclosure. The mayor offered a version of that defense again on Friday when city investigators disclosed in a report that the correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, had taken his city-issued car beyond the five boroughs on 90 days last year — mostly on trips to Maine — and had paid for gas and tolls with city money. Mr. Ponte’s absences coincided with a time of increasing violence at the Rikers Island jail complex and continuing reforms there that he was hired to put in place. “He was advised; he followed that guidance; that guidance was wrong,” Mr. de Blasio said during a weekly call-in radio appearance with WNYC’s Brian Lehrer. The mayor said his administration would fix the problem and “make everyone whole.” Soon after, his first deputy mayor issued a description of “additional protocols and safeguards” for the use of city vehicles. But Mr. de Blasio’s stance underscored his administration’s tendency to stress the care taken with issues of legality while appearing more casual, and sometimes even dismissive, of ethical questions. For instance, the mayor seemed unconcerned over the roughly $1,800 that Mr. Ponte spent on gas and tolls, often driving to and from his house in Maine, and the time he spent out of state. “I don’t begrudge someone if they need down time so long as they get the job done,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding of the spending on gas: “I want to remind you that I just released an $84 billion budget, so the fact that there’s a thousand dollars in gas expenses, you know, it’s put in perspective.” But some former city officials and government watchdogs found it hard to comprehend that an official who is in charge of a major department under a federal consent decree and responsible for addressing endemic violence in jails could be unfamiliar with the city’s basic conflict of interest rules. “It was clear to me we could not use city-owned vehicles at taxpayer expense for vacations or trips out of state,” said Florence Finkle, a former deputy commissioner for integrity and policy at the Correction Department who oversaw internal investigations. “If an emergency required us to return to Rikers, we had placards we could use with our personal vehicles to gain access to the island.” She cited an episode in which a correction worker lost vacation days for taking a department-issued vehicle to New Jersey. The department only learned of the infraction because an accident occurred, she said, indicating that such activity might be more widespread than is generally known. The Investigation Department’s report said that “21 senior-level employees routinely abused take-home vehicle privileges” and charged gas and tolls for personal trips to city taxpayers. The cases could result in fines from the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board. The mayor’s defense of Mr. Ponte led to an unusual back-and-forth between Mr. de Blasio and Mark G. Peters, the investigations commissioner, on Friday. “Commissioner Ponte and others did not receive official ‘advice’ that they could use their cars for personal trips out of state,” Mr. Peters, who was once the mayor’s campaign treasurer, said in a statement issued in response to the de Blasio administration’s statements to the media. “There can be no defense of this behavior and City Hall harms government integrity by even trying.” “Snooze,” wrote Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s press secretary, on Twitter. Later, in a telephone interview, Mr. Phillips said Mr. Ponte had not sought “formal written advice” but had consulted with “senior staff"" about “what the policy was and whether he was in accordance with it, and they said yes.” Still, the administration’s I-asked-and-they-said-it-was-O.K. defense struck some critics as a weak explanation for what seemed to be an ethical lapse clear enough to anyone ever entrusted with a company car. In most cases, city rules prohibit the use of government vehicles “for personal activities, except for required rest periods, meals, and brief stops incidental to the conduct of official city business.” Dick Dadey, the executive director of the Citizens Union, a watchdog group, said that Mr. Ponte’s “explanation rings hollow, and is even more suspect when you look at the administration’s use of lawyers to defend what are questionable practices that may not be illegal but certainly are unethical.” Mr. Dadey said Mr. Ponte “should be fired, both for being away so much and for the inappropriate use” of the car. Paul J. Massey Jr., the presumed Republican front-runner in this year’s mayoral race, issued a statement calling for Mr. Ponte to be fired, while the president of the correction officers’ union said he should resign. Although they essentially pleaded ignorance, Mr. Ponte and his top aides had every reason to be aware of the rules regarding the use of city-owned vehicles. In a March 2016 case, the Conflicts of Interest Board issued a $1,500 fine to Gregory Kuczinski, an assistant commissioner for investigations in the Correction Department, after he had a correction officer drive him, his wife and his children to the airport for a family vacation. Mr. Kuczinski, who was promoted by Mr. Ponte shortly after the fine, was also reprimanded on Friday for using his city-owned car for personal trips to airports and on a golf outing.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/new-york-schools-lead-water.html,"Last year, with fears about lead poisoning running high in the wake of the water crisis in Flint, Mich., New York City officials said that they had tested the water in all the city’s public schools and that the results should be reassuring: Only 1 percent of outlets had lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency’s action level of 15 parts per billion. But after The New York Times reported that the city had run the water in every outlet for two hours the night before taking the water samples, a process called flushing, experts said that the practice had most likely hidden lead problems. They said the city should throw out the results and redo the tests. In the end, the city did. On Friday, the new results were released, and they paint a starkly different picture: This time, 8 percent of outlets had lead levels above 15 parts per billion. And the vast majority of school buildings — 83 percent — had at least one outlet with a lead level above the threshold. The city had previously said that two-thirds of its roughly 1,500 school buildings had no outlets above the 15 parts per billion threshold. Flushing cleans most soluble lead and lead particles out of the pipes and thus reduces lead levels temporarily. Two schools in Queens were among the worst for the number of outlets involved. At Public School 95, the Eastwood School, in Jamaica, which has 1,500 students, 34 outlets had lead levels above the E.P.A. threshold. A water fountain in the cafeteria had a level of 3,200 parts per billion. Several other water fountains — in the cafeteria, a play area and a school hallway — had lead levels more than 40 times the E.P.A. action level. When the school was tested the first time, under the protocol that included the flushing, the highest level found was 35 parts per billion. At Public School/Intermediate School 208, in the Bellerose neighborhood, 36 outlets had lead levels above the threshold, including a classroom water fountain with a lead level of 1,740 parts per billion, and a faucet in a girls’ bathroom with a lead level of 8,850 parts per billion. When the school, which has about 700 students, was tested the first time, the highest level found was 24 parts per billion. In recent months, schools have sent letters home and posted them on their websites informing parents about the tests and the levels found in individual outlets. In January, the state released a summary of results from tests of about a third of the city’s school buildings. The city’s Education Department said every outlet where a sample exceeded the threshold had been turned off and would be turned on again only after it was replaced and new tests found levels below 15 parts per billion. Additionally, all schools where tests found at least one sample above the threshold have been put on a protocol of flushing the water every Monday morning before school starts. New cases of lead poisoning among children in New York City have declined significantly in the past decade. The city’s health department investigates cases of lead poisoning in children, and the Education Department said there had never been a known case of lead poisoning traced to drinking water in schools.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/kosciuszko-bridge-pronounciation.html,"The question is not whether a new Kosciuszko Bridge is needed (it is), nor whether a cable-stayed Kosciuszko Bridge looks better than the old through-truss crossing (it does). The question is: How is it pronounced? Tadeusz Kosciuszko — properly, Kościuszko — was a hero of the Revolutionary War. Born in Poland in 1746 and trained there as a military engineer, Kosciuszko arrived in America in 1776. The fortifications he designed along the Hudson River, most important at West Point, were widely credited with keeping British forces at bay. He later championed Polish nationhood, fighting bravely for what was then a lost cause. He died in exile in 1817 from his partitioned homeland. Poland was under German occupation in 1940 when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia named the new Meeker Avenue Bridge between Brooklyn and Queens in honor of Kosciuszko. Fifteen thousand Poles and Polish-Americans attended the ceremony. “I am confident that Poland will live again,” John J. Bennett Jr., the New York State attorney general, told the crowd. It was a stirring gesture and a fine reminder of America’s indebtedness to Poland. It has also caused nothing but grief ever since. New Yorkers have struggled to master the Polish pronunciation or — as they are given to doing — have invented their own. “There are many variations regarding Kosciuszko’s pronunciation,” Marta Hausman, the public diplomacy assistant at the Polish consulate general in New York, acknowledged by email. “The closest one is: ko-SHCH-OO-SH-ko.” Maciej Golubiewski, the consul general of Poland, nailed it on Thursday at the dedication of the new bridge. (“Kosciuszko Bridge Opening” on YouTube, at minute 12:25.) Of course, you would expect nothing less. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo came admirably close, but seemed to miss the second “sh.” (Minute 18:44.) The announcer, however, gave Kosciuszko a New York twist all its own: “Koch-ee-OH-sko.” (Minute 00:10.) Now, that is much more in line with such customary local pronunciations as “Kos-kee-OOS-ko” and “Kos-kee-OSS-ko.” It is easy to see why state officials simply call it the “K Bridge.” And it is not the only new bridge with a name that poses a pronunciation challenge. At the Goethals Bridge, new and old, some use a short “o,” others a long “o.” The third project is the New New York Bridge, which is to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge. It is pronounced “NOO-nyawk.” ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/amtrak-penn-station-disruptions.html,"TRENTON — Amtrak officials said on Friday that overhauling the tracks and rail equipment at Pennsylvania Station in New York would require two or three significant disruptions to commuting schedules over the summer. Precisely when the disruptions would occur and how long they would last, however, the officials could not say. They said they would meet next week with officials of commuter railroads in New Jersey and New York to decide how to schedule the track closings to limit their effects on the 600,000 train riders who pass through Penn Station each weekday. Amtrak should be ready to lay out its plan for the weekday disruptions by the week of May 8,, the railroad’s chief executive, Charles W. Moorman, told lawmakers at a hearing in Trenton. Mr. Moorman said Amtrak’s goal was to finish the most complicated repairs by Labor Day, and to then resume working on the tracks only at night and on weekends. He said he did not know how many weekdays would be disrupted but that “it’s certainly not going to be every day this summer.” Mr. Moorman said the disruptions would affect riders who use Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road, all of which share the tracks and platforms at Penn Station, North America’s busiest rail terminal. Amtrak, as the landlord at Penn Station, has drawn up a schedule for the work and will give officials with the commuter railroads a chance next week to respond to it and to suggest changes, Mr. Moorman said. “We are eager to work collaboratively together with New Jersey Transit,” he said. “In general, our organizations have a very good relationship at the ground level.” Steven Santoro, New Jersey Transit’s executive director, testified at the hearing after the Amtrak officials. He told lawmakers that his staff had just received the Amtrak proposal and had not had a chance to assess it. The plan to schedule track work at the station on weekdays is a change for Amtrak, whose traditional approach has been to limit work to late nights and weekends. But a series of derailments and other problems at and around the station in the past several weeks prompted Amtrak officials to alter their strategy. Assemblyman John McKeon, a Democrat, referred to a timeline of recent train troubles displayed on screens in the hearing room as a “30-day nightmare.” He said it was hypocritical of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to blame Amtrak for the problems, given that Mr. Christie, a Republican, had canceled a project meant to double the capacity for commuter trains between New Jersey and New York City. “The fact that the governor has the temerity to blame anyone but himself, pointing at Amtrak, is astounding to me,” Mr. McKeon said. On Thursday, Mr. Christie told reporters that he had been right to threaten to withhold payments to Amtrak for maintaining the station because Amtrak had accepted responsibility for the derailments and had decided to accelerate repairs. Mr. Santoro said that Mr. Christie’s goal in making the threat was to get Amtrak’s attention. “I think that attention’s been got,” Mr. Santoro said. ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/florence-finch-dead-coast-guard-war-hero.html,"Florence Finch was an atypical hometown hero. For nearly 50 years after World War II, virtually no one outside of her family knew that she was a highly decorated Coast Guard veteran and a former prisoner of war whose exploits had been buried in time. “Women don’t tell war stories like men do,” her daughter, Betty Murphy, of Ithaca, N.Y., said recently. And even on those rare occasions when she recalled her heroics in the Philippines — supplying fuel to the Filipino underground, sabotaging supplies destined for the Japanese occupiers, smuggling food to starving American prisoners and surviving torture after she was captured — Mrs. Finch did so with the utmost modesty. “I feel very humble,” she once said, “because my activities in the war effort were trivial compared with those of the people who gave their lives for their country.” It was perhaps reflective of that modesty that when she died on Dec. 8 at 101 in an Ithaca nursing home, the news did not travel widely. Newspapers in central New York carried a brief obituary, but her death went unreported virtually everywhere else. It was only after the announcement by the Coast Guard on Thursday that she would be buried with full military honors on Saturday at Pleasant Grove Cemetery in Cayuga Heights, N.Y., that word of her death spread nationwide. Indeed, the almost five-month delay in her memorial owed something to Mrs. Finch’s solicitous nature. Near death, she had made it clear that she did not want her funeral to disrupt her relatives’ Christmas holidays or to make mourners travel during a dark and icy Southern Tier winter. (Besides, she relished the annual resurgence wrought by spring.) So it was put off. The funeral is to be held in Ithaca, with the military honors coming afterward, a ceremony befitting this Philippine-born daughter of an American father and Filipino mother — one who, in 1947, received the Medal of Freedom (the forerunner of today’s Presidential Medal of Freedom), the nation’s highest award to a civilian. When the Japanese occupied the Philippines from 1942 to 1945, Mrs. Finch posed as a Filipino, but she became a United States citizen after the war. “Because she was over 18, she could have chosen to be American or Filipino,” Ms. Murphy said. “When the Japanese landed, she chose to be mum, but in her heart she had chosen to be an American.” Mrs. Finch was born Loring May Ebersole on Oct. 11, 1915, in Santiago, on Luzon Island in the northern Philippines. (It is unclear how her first name became Florence.) Her father, Charles, had fought in the Philippines for the Army during the Spanish-American War and remained there after it was over. Her mother was the former Maria Hermosa. Betty, as Mrs. Finch was known all her life, graduated from high school and was hired as a stenographer at Army Intelligence headquarters in Manila under Maj. E. C. Engelhart. While working there, she met Charles E. Smith, a Navy chief electrician’s mate. They married in August 1941, a few months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on Dec. 7. When the war did begin, Mr. Smith reported to his PT boat. He died on Feb. 8, 1942, trying to resupply American and Filipino troops trapped on Corregidor Island and the Bataan Peninsula. Five weeks earlier, Manila had fallen to the Japanese. Mrs. Finch (then Mrs. Smith) convinced the occupying forces that she was Filipino and, armed with superior penmanship, wangled a job writing gas rationing vouchers for the now Japanese-run Philippine Liquid Fuel Distributing Union. Unbeknown to her employer, however, she was actually collaborating with the Philippine resistance movement. Her job enabled her to divert precious fuel supplies to the underground and help sabotage shipments to the Japanese. After she learned of her husband’s death, her efforts became even more vigorous. (She was honored by the Philippine government in 2011.) Meanwhile, Major Englehart (he became a lieutenant colonel) managed to get word to her that he had been captured and that he and fellow war prisoners were being maltreated. She helped smuggle food, medicine, soap and clothing to them in a prison until she was caught. Confined to a two-by-four-foot cell, she was interrogated and then tortured, enduring repeated shocks from electrical clamps on her fingers. She never talked. She was tried and sentenced to three years’ hard labor at the Women’s Correctional Institution in Mandaluyong, just outside Manila. When she was finally freed by American troops on Feb. 10, 1945, she weighed 80 pounds. Rather than remain in her native country, she moved to Buffalo, where her father’s sister lived. She joined the Coast Guard Women’s Reserve, or the SPARs (a contraction of the Coast Guard motto “Semper Paratus” — Always Ready). She enlisted, she said, to avenge her husband. When her superiors learned of her wartime exploits, she was awarded the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Ribbon; the Coast Guard described her as the first woman to receive the decoration. The Medal of Freedom was bestowed for meritorious service. After the war ended, she was discharged as a seaman second class in 1946 and enrolled in secretarial school in New York City, where she met and married an Army veteran, Robert Finch. A chemist, he was hired by Agway, the agricultural products supplier, and moved the family to Ithaca. Mr. Finch died in 1968. In addition to her daughter, Betty, Mrs. Finch is survived by a son, Bob; a sister, Olive Keats; six grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. As Mrs. Finch was rearing her children and working as a secretary at Cornell University, her neighbors never suspected that they were in the presence of a war hero. In the early 1990s, though, she was rediscovered by the military after she completed a government questionnaire that she had received in conjunction with plans to erect the Women in Military Service for America Memorial in Washington. The Coast Guard named a building on Sand Island in Hawaii in her honor in 1995. Ms. Murphy decided to alert the news media about the building dedication, noting that her mother would be in attendance. “It was the first anyone knew,” Ms. Murphy said. “I figured it was time. And when she came home and people met her at the bus station, she was flabbergasted.” In 2015, the Coast Guard’s official blog said of Mrs. Finch, “Of the thousands of women who have served with honor in the United States Coast Guard, one stands out for her bravery and devotion to duty.” Her wartime legacy will be publicly honored again on Saturday by a military honor guard. But privately her heroism endured without medals, plaques or flags. “It had not defined her,” Ms. Murphy said, “but it defined how she lived her life.” ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/a-hospital-no-longer-afloat-but-buoyant-with-memories.html,"Jeffrey Delgado, an aspiring archivist from Queens College, has been telling friends that he went through yellowing documents and old photographs for an exhibit showcasing the history of the Floating Hospital. They all asked the same question: “Is it still on a boat?” The answer, as he learned from the some of the newest records he examined, is no. The Floating Hospital kept its name when it decommissioned its last vessel 15 years ago. But the material Mr. Delgado went through was high and dry in Long Island City, Queens, the Floating Hospital’s base since it moved to a permanent home on land. Now the finds from the Floating Hospital’s archives can be seen in an exhibition that he and two other archivists-in-training assembled under the supervision of full-fledged archivists at Citibank and the Queens Library. For generations, the Floating Hospital made medical care as carefree as a day at the beach by giving children a boat ride that included a checkup. It traced its origins to 1866, with rented barges, and its getaway mission to 1872, when The New York Times reported on newsboys playing in a park and observed that they would do well to get some fresh-air relief from the crowded, fetid city that they plied every day. Sean T. Granahan, the president and general counsel of the Floating Hospital, said it had 100,000 photographs and other evidence “of our epic 150-year journey through health care” that needed to be reviewed, assessed and preserved. The archive project came about when officials at Citibank put the Floating Hospital in touch with the Queens Library, which works with community-based organizations in Queens “that have amazing material but don’t have archivists to make them available to the public,” said Natalie Milbrodt, the library’s director of metadata services and the director of its Queens Memory program. The library also maintains the Citi Center for Culture Queens Library Fellowship for graduate students like Mr. Delgado. So the Floating Hospital became an assignment for the three recipients of this year’s fellowships. In addition to Mr. Delgado, they are Regina Carra, who like Mr. Delgado is working on dual master’s degrees, one in history, the other in library science, and Pamela Griffin-Hansen, a candidate for a master’s degree in library science and archives at St. John’s University. Each received a stipend of $1,000. Kerri Anne Burke, the global curator of Citigroup’s Citi Heritage Collection, said the students made recommendations on how to take care of the Floating Hospital’s files and artifacts, and then went to work designing the exhibit. Mr. Delgado and Ms. Carra worked on the layout, while Ms. Griffin-Hansen prepared labels to go with the photographs and the items they had chosen. The exhibition fills six display cases near the food court in the Citigroup building at One Court Square in Long Island City. Among the items is a bell from the Helen C. Juilliard II, the second of the Floating Hospital’s five vessels. Seeing it in the display case prompted a question: Did they ring it? No, Mr. Delgado said: “We’re archivists.” Another find was a guest log from 1899, with the names of everyone who boarded the ship. Mr. Delgado remembered what flashed through his mind as he picked up the log: “I have to be careful with this book right now — it’s really fragile.” “We were jumping for joy because we didn’t think we’d find anything so well preserved,” he said. “I checked for water damage, like a good archivist should.” But there was not much. “They didn’t find any mold or the kinds of things you often find when you’re looking at a collection for the first time,” said Ms. Milbrodt of the Queens Library. She said that the Floating Hospital had “kept their materials in really good condition.” They also caught up on the organization’s recent past. Terrorism doomed the floating part of the Floating Hospital. The organization abandoned ship after the 9/11 attacks. It turned its last vessel, anchored off Lower Manhattan, into an emergency clinic as the twin towers fell. In time, the vessel was moved to Brooklyn, where it was used as offices; the medical care was provided at clinics around the city that the Floating Hospital had opened in the 1990s. The Floating Hospital was also struggling financially, with $6 million in debt, according to Mr. Granahan. The group sold the ship, actually a barge, and refocused on land-based ways to provide care that would generate sufficient reimbursements. It now describes itself as the largest charity health care provider for families in the city’s homeless shelters and domestic-violence centers. Not everything the archivists-in-training turned up went into the exhibit. “I found a lot of blueprints of Seaside Hospital before it was a thing,” Mr. Delgado said, referring to a nursery and medical care facility in New Dorp, Staten Island, that the Floating Hospital ran from 1881 until the mid-1960s. “I wanted to incorporate them,” he said, but they were too big to digitize and too fragile to mount in the display cases.

Buyers are taking their time before signing on the dotted line, and sales agents and brokers have had to get more creative in drawing attention to their listings. “We’ve seen buyers come see an apartment four or five times and they’re still on the fence,” said Steven Rutter, director of Stribling Marketing Associates, a division of Stribling & Associates. “There’s no sense of urgency.” Luxury, of course, is a relative term when it comes to New York City, where the average price of a condominium keeps rising and is currently $3.2 million, according to the latest report from CityRealty.com.

Mr. Miller calculates that 6,000 apartments from new development, many in the million- and multimillion-dollar price range, hit the market in Manhattan in 2016. He estimated that 3,000 units would be introduced this year, and another 2,000 units in 2018. Even though some buyers are taking their time in sorting through this oversupply, they are still willing to sign contracts. And prices are generally stable, though with some exceptions. Apartments priced in the $1 million to $3 million range may prompt a bidding war, but most homes $5 million and under are selling well. Many offerings over $10 million have been discounted already, and some can be negotiated down as much as 30 percent more, brokers say. The market was off to a good start this year. There were 330 contracts signed in the first quarter of 2017, a 33 percent increase from the same period last year, according to a report from Olshan Realty Inc., which tracks sales in this price range. This is evidence that buyers are pulling the trigger, even if they are taking their time about it. Still, brokers have to find new ways to make their offerings stand out. To introduce the sale of an $11.75 million, four-bedroom penthouse in Midtown, Tara King-Brown and Amy Williamson, two associate brokers from the Corcoran Group, ditched the evening cocktail party, the industry’s tried-and-tested event, and instead held a morning meditation class in the building’s common-area yoga room. About a dozen people, mostly brokers, attended the class, which was run by MNDFL, a firm that runs several meditation studios throughout the city. After a 30-minute session of deep breathing and reflection as the sun rose over the East River, the group got a tour of the penthouse at 305 East 51st Street. “What’s fantastic about this place is the view and morning light so we wanted the brokers to feel it for themselves,” Ms. King-Brown said. “Hosting a different type of networking event is necessary to stand out, especially since buyers have so much to choose from.” To draw attention to a $6.995 million, four-bedroom condo at 6 Cortlandt Alley, Susan Wires, a Stribling saleswoman, held a continuing education class run by the firm TitleVest called “Condominium Essentials” for agents and brokers in the residence. She said it helped “get a lot of eyes on this building since we’re a small, new development, not a large tower that gets a lot of attention.” Fredrik Eklund, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman and a cast member of the television show “Million Dollar Listing New York,” recently invited 55 so-called Instagram influencers, or those with the most followers in the city, to a four-bedroom, $20.75 million home at Madison Square Park Tower. Ripping a page out of fashion marketing, where social media stars are invited to post photos and comment on designer wear and store openings, Mr. Eklund allowed the group to post photos from the apartment on the 56th floor. He admitted that the move was a little risky, since he didn’t check to see what everyone was posting. “But if you’re an Instagram influencer, you’re creative, a good photographer,” so you’re guaranteed a good shot, he said. “They were happy to have access to an apartment with a gorgeous view, plus I reached a non-real-estate audience.” The event generated more than 100 postings on the building, eliciting over 150,000 interactions (likes, comments, views) and reached over five million Instagram users who follow the invited social media influencers. The building’s own Instagram page immediately signed up about 1,000 new followers after the event, now totaling about 14,600. Mr. Eklund said a Chinese fashion designer who was in town in February for fashion week made an appointment to see an apartment after the Instagram blitz. He said many younger buyers check information on a property through social media even before looking at the building’s website. Many developers and brokers like to turn a model showroom or listing into a temporary art gallery and give parties, an easy guest list to compile because buyers of high-end art and real estate tend to overlap. Vickey Barron, a broker at Douglas Elliman, said she prefers smaller get-togethers. To drive attention to a Chelsea condominium building, she organized a small breakfast with the developer and several brokers. “I gave my friends access to someone they wouldn’t otherwise have,” she said. “The result is, though, you’re pulling people together that help you get a contract signed.” To get a jump on selling new homes built by the Farrell Building Company in the Hamptons, Andrew Azoulay, also an Elliman broker, opened a pop-up showroom in TriBeCa, thought to be the first for Hamptons real estate. He is organizing weekly events, which include child-friendly gatherings like movie nights and a block party. The kicker: a free helicopter ride for potential buyers. So far, he has used the helicopter only once, to show a couple a nearly $16 million home in Water Mill, N.Y. The couple didn’t take that particular home, Mr. Azoulay said, but are interested in a custom-built one from the developer. Mr. Azoulay has sold 10 homes since the start of the year. “And the season is just starting,” he said. ",New York Times,0
