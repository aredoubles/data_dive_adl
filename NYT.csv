https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/choate-life-trustees-resign-sex-abuse.html,"Two former headmasters who were life trustees at Choate Rosemary Hall stepped down this week, forced aside by allegations that teachers at the school had sexually abused students for decades and that administrators had not responded appropriately. The two trustees were Charles Dey, who served as headmaster at the elite Connecticut boarding school from 1973 to 1991, and Edward Shanahan, who held that position from 1991 to 2011. Choate released a report this month from investigators at the law firm Covington & Burling that named 12 former faculty members who it said had abused students in cases dating back to the 1960s. One teacher was said to have raped a student while on a school trip in Costa Rica. Another used a girl’s disciplinary issues to pressure her to have sex with him repeatedly, the report said. For many years, administrators at the school largely responded to reports of misconduct by trying to keep them quiet. In some cases, administrators decided that accused faculty members could remain at Choate. Other teachers were forced out, but none of the episodes were reported to the authorities until 2010, even though Connecticut educators have been legally required to report suspected abuse since 1967. Because the accusations were never reported, teachers suspected of misconduct were able to move on to work at other schools. Much of the abuse documented by investigators occurred while Mr. Dey and Mr. Shanahan were in charge, and many alumni have called for their removal from their positions. Mr. Dey resigned on Thursday and Mr. Shanahan resigned on Friday. In a statement, Lorraine S. Connelly, a Choate spokeswoman, thanked Mr. Shanahan and Mr. Dey “for their contributions to the school” and said, “we believe their resignations are important steps in our community’s healing process.” The news of their resignations was first reported by The Record-Journal in Connecticut. The report released by Choate, which documented misconduct claims in detail, marked a sharp departure from the way the school had handled such issues in the past. Reached by phone, Mr. Dey said he was ""proud of the school, in terms of what they have done and the way they have approached it.” In a lengthy statement, his first since the Choate report was released, Mr. Shanahan said Friday that he was “heartbroken” to read about what some students had experienced at the school while he was its headmaster. “The burden I personally carry is that children were harmed by faculty during my tenure, for which I am deeply, deeply sorry, and the only consolation I have is that, as a result of this report, future incidents like these will be far less likely to occur, and survivors will feel more enabled to come forward for the support they deserve,” Mr. Shanahan said. “Thank you for the privilege of serving you for 20 years. Would that I had done it better.” ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/senator-menendez-corruption-case.html,"A Florida eye doctor was convicted on Friday of running a vast scheme to defraud Medicare of more than $90 million in a case that could have significant ramifications for Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey. The doctor, Salomon E. Melgen, a prominent ophthalmologist, has been the longtime political benefactor of Mr. Menendez, a Democrat. Both face federal corruption charges in an unrelated case scheduled to go on trial in September in Newark. The senator is accused of trading political favors for free trips on the doctor’s private jet, lavish vacations to his resort home in the Dominican Republic and a stay at a five-star hotel in Paris. A jury in Palm Beach County, Fla., found Dr. Melgen guilty on all 67 counts of Medicare fraud, and according to prosecutors in the case, he could spend at least 15 years in prison. The conviction and the sentence he now faces could increase pressure on Dr. Melgen to cooperate with the authorities in the case against Mr. Menendez, his co-defendant in their pending trial. After he is sentenced in the Florida case in July, Dr. Melgen, if he should choose to cooperate, could seek to have that sentence reduced. A provision of federal law allows a judge, upon a motion by the government, to reduce a defendant’s sentence if the defendant is found to have provided “substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.” A lawyer for Dr. Melgen in the Florida trial, Kirk Ogrosky, said the doctor views the two cases as completely separate. “It will have no impact on what will happen in New Jersey,” Mr. Ogrosky said in a phone interview. “He intends to go to trial in New Jersey in September, and nothing about the Florida case changes that.” A lawyer for Mr. Menendez said that the senator was “saddened for his longtime friend” but that the conviction in Florida would have “no bearing” on the bribery charges against his client. “This verdict will have no impact on him,” the lawyer, Abbe David Lowell, said in a statement. “Dr. Melgen’s case focused solely on the day-to-day operations of his medical practice and the private care of his patients — specifics of which the senator could not be aware, nor has it ever been suggested otherwise.” Mr. Menendez and Dr. Melgen have pleaded not guilty to the bribery charges, and Mr. Menendez has spent two years aggressively fighting them. They have been close friends since the 1990s, and the bribery charges revolve around their relationship. Dr. Melgen gave $700,000 through his company, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants, to the Senate Majority PAC, a so-called super PAC to support Senate Democrats, and instructed that the contributions aid Mr. Menendez’s 2012 re-election campaign. For the help Mr. Menendez received, prosecutors contend, the senator urged the Obama administration to alter the Medicare reimbursement policy in a way that would make millions for Dr. Melgen. In 2012 alone, Dr. Melgen received $21 million in Medicare reimbursements. In addition, prosecutors said, Mr. Menendez tried to push a port security deal that involved Dr. Melgen and worked to obtain United States travel visas for the doctor’s foreign girlfriends. Mr. Menendez was rewarded for his help, according to prosecutors, and received free trips on Dr. Melgen’s jet and spent three nights in an executive suite in Paris for a trip valued at nearly $5,000. After an ethics complaint was filed against Mr. Menendez for not reporting trips to the Dominican Republic as gifts, he wrote a $58,500 check to reimburse Dr. Melgen’s company. Federal investigators started to look into Dr. Melgen’s billings to Medicare because he was charging a significantly higher rate for a medication to treat macular degeneration than his peers were. The government said he billed for one vial of the medicine for each patient when he had in fact used one vial to treat three or four patients. Mr. Menendez came under federal scrutiny when he sought to help Dr. Melgen in the billing dispute, calling the Medicare director at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2009 and mentioning it at a meeting with the acting administrator in 2012.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-joseph-ponte-jails-rikers.html,"What has become a familiar defense for Mayor Bill de Blasio when he faces ethical questions about his behavior or that of officials in his administration can be boiled down to a simple, grade-school rejoinder: They said I could. Mr. de Blasio said as much in response to inquiries about his fund-raising practices that attracted state and federal scrutiny, about a political nonprofit he created to advocate for his policies, and about the designation of certain outside advisers — mostly friends and former campaign workers — as “agents of the city” whose communications he argued should be immune from public disclosure. The mayor offered a version of that defense again on Friday when city investigators disclosed in a report that the correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, had taken his city-issued car beyond the five boroughs on 90 days last year — mostly on trips to Maine — and had paid for gas and tolls with city money. Mr. Ponte’s absences coincided with a time of increasing violence at the Rikers Island jail complex and continuing reforms there that he was hired to put in place. “He was advised; he followed that guidance; that guidance was wrong,” Mr. de Blasio said during a weekly call-in radio appearance with WNYC’s Brian Lehrer. The mayor said his administration would fix the problem and “make everyone whole.” Soon after, his first deputy mayor issued a description of “additional protocols and safeguards” for the use of city vehicles. But Mr. de Blasio’s stance underscored his administration’s tendency to stress the care taken with issues of legality while appearing more casual, and sometimes even dismissive, of ethical questions. For instance, the mayor seemed unconcerned over the roughly $1,800 that Mr. Ponte spent on gas and tolls, often driving to and from his house in Maine, and the time he spent out of state. “I don’t begrudge someone if they need down time so long as they get the job done,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding of the spending on gas: “I want to remind you that I just released an $84 billion budget, so the fact that there’s a thousand dollars in gas expenses, you know, it’s put in perspective.” But some former city officials and government watchdogs found it hard to comprehend that an official who is in charge of a major department under a federal consent decree and responsible for addressing endemic violence in jails could be unfamiliar with the city’s basic conflict of interest rules. “It was clear to me we could not use city-owned vehicles at taxpayer expense for vacations or trips out of state,” said Florence Finkle, a former deputy commissioner for integrity and policy at the Correction Department who oversaw internal investigations. “If an emergency required us to return to Rikers, we had placards we could use with our personal vehicles to gain access to the island.” She cited an episode in which a correction worker lost vacation days for taking a department-issued vehicle to New Jersey. The department only learned of the infraction because an accident occurred, she said, indicating that such activity might be more widespread than is generally known. The Investigation Department’s report said that “21 senior-level employees routinely abused take-home vehicle privileges” and charged gas and tolls for personal trips to city taxpayers. The cases could result in fines from the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board. The mayor’s defense of Mr. Ponte led to an unusual back-and-forth between Mr. de Blasio and Mark G. Peters, the investigations commissioner, on Friday. “Commissioner Ponte and others did not receive official ‘advice’ that they could use their cars for personal trips out of state,” Mr. Peters, who was once the mayor’s campaign treasurer, said in a statement issued in response to the de Blasio administration’s statements to the media. “There can be no defense of this behavior and City Hall harms government integrity by even trying.” “Snooze,” wrote Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s press secretary, on Twitter. Later, in a telephone interview, Mr. Phillips said Mr. Ponte had not sought “formal written advice” but had consulted with “senior staff"" about “what the policy was and whether he was in accordance with it, and they said yes.” Still, the administration’s I-asked-and-they-said-it-was-O.K. defense struck some critics as a weak explanation for what seemed to be an ethical lapse clear enough to anyone ever entrusted with a company car. In most cases, city rules prohibit the use of government vehicles “for personal activities, except for required rest periods, meals, and brief stops incidental to the conduct of official city business.” Dick Dadey, the executive director of the Citizens Union, a watchdog group, said that Mr. Ponte’s “explanation rings hollow, and is even more suspect when you look at the administration’s use of lawyers to defend what are questionable practices that may not be illegal but certainly are unethical.” Mr. Dadey said Mr. Ponte “should be fired, both for being away so much and for the inappropriate use” of the car. Paul J. Massey Jr., the presumed Republican front-runner in this year’s mayoral race, issued a statement calling for Mr. Ponte to be fired, while the president of the correction officers’ union said he should resign. Although they essentially pleaded ignorance, Mr. Ponte and his top aides had every reason to be aware of the rules regarding the use of city-owned vehicles. In a March 2016 case, the Conflicts of Interest Board issued a $1,500 fine to Gregory Kuczinski, an assistant commissioner for investigations in the Correction Department, after he had a correction officer drive him, his wife and his children to the airport for a family vacation. Mr. Kuczinski, who was promoted by Mr. Ponte shortly after the fine, was also reprimanded on Friday for using his city-owned car for personal trips to airports and on a golf outing.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/new-york-schools-lead-water.html,"Last year, with fears about lead poisoning running high in the wake of the water crisis in Flint, Mich., New York City officials said that they had tested the water in all the city’s public schools and that the results should be reassuring: Only 1 percent of outlets had lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency’s action level of 15 parts per billion. But after The New York Times reported that the city had run the water in every outlet for two hours the night before taking the water samples, a process called flushing, experts said that the practice had most likely hidden lead problems. They said the city should throw out the results and redo the tests. In the end, the city did. On Friday, the new results were released, and they paint a starkly different picture: This time, 8 percent of outlets had lead levels above 15 parts per billion. And the vast majority of school buildings — 83 percent — had at least one outlet with a lead level above the threshold. The city had previously said that two-thirds of its roughly 1,500 school buildings had no outlets above the 15 parts per billion threshold. Flushing cleans most soluble lead and lead particles out of the pipes and thus reduces lead levels temporarily. Two schools in Queens were among the worst for the number of outlets involved. At Public School 95, the Eastwood School, in Jamaica, which has 1,500 students, 34 outlets had lead levels above the E.P.A. threshold. A water fountain in the cafeteria had a level of 3,200 parts per billion. Several other water fountains — in the cafeteria, a play area and a school hallway — had lead levels more than 40 times the E.P.A. action level. When the school was tested the first time, under the protocol that included the flushing, the highest level found was 35 parts per billion. At Public School/Intermediate School 208, in the Bellerose neighborhood, 36 outlets had lead levels above the threshold, including a classroom water fountain with a lead level of 1,740 parts per billion, and a faucet in a girls’ bathroom with a lead level of 8,850 parts per billion. When the school, which has about 700 students, was tested the first time, the highest level found was 24 parts per billion. In recent months, schools have sent letters home and posted them on their websites informing parents about the tests and the levels found in individual outlets. In January, the state released a summary of results from tests of about a third of the city’s school buildings. The city’s Education Department said every outlet where a sample exceeded the threshold had been turned off and would be turned on again only after it was replaced and new tests found levels below 15 parts per billion. Additionally, all schools where tests found at least one sample above the threshold have been put on a protocol of flushing the water every Monday morning before school starts. New cases of lead poisoning among children in New York City have declined significantly in the past decade. The city’s health department investigates cases of lead poisoning in children, and the Education Department said there had never been a known case of lead poisoning traced to drinking water in schools.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/kosciuszko-bridge-pronounciation.html,"The question is not whether a new Kosciuszko Bridge is needed (it is), nor whether a cable-stayed Kosciuszko Bridge looks better than the old through-truss crossing (it does). The question is: How is it pronounced? Tadeusz Kosciuszko — properly, Kościuszko — was a hero of the Revolutionary War. Born in Poland in 1746 and trained there as a military engineer, Kosciuszko arrived in America in 1776. The fortifications he designed along the Hudson River, most important at West Point, were widely credited with keeping British forces at bay. He later championed Polish nationhood, fighting bravely for what was then a lost cause. He died in exile in 1817 from his partitioned homeland. Poland was under German occupation in 1940 when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia named the new Meeker Avenue Bridge between Brooklyn and Queens in honor of Kosciuszko. Fifteen thousand Poles and Polish-Americans attended the ceremony. “I am confident that Poland will live again,” John J. Bennett Jr., the New York State attorney general, told the crowd. It was a stirring gesture and a fine reminder of America’s indebtedness to Poland. It has also caused nothing but grief ever since. New Yorkers have struggled to master the Polish pronunciation or — as they are given to doing — have invented their own. “There are many variations regarding Kosciuszko’s pronunciation,” Marta Hausman, the public diplomacy assistant at the Polish consulate general in New York, acknowledged by email. “The closest one is: ko-SHCH-OO-SH-ko.” Maciej Golubiewski, the consul general of Poland, nailed it on Thursday at the dedication of the new bridge. (“Kosciuszko Bridge Opening” on YouTube, at minute 12:25.) Of course, you would expect nothing less. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo came admirably close, but seemed to miss the second “sh.” (Minute 18:44.) The announcer, however, gave Kosciuszko a New York twist all its own: “Koch-ee-OH-sko.” (Minute 00:10.) Now, that is much more in line with such customary local pronunciations as “Kos-kee-OOS-ko” and “Kos-kee-OSS-ko.” It is easy to see why state officials simply call it the “K Bridge.” And it is not the only new bridge with a name that poses a pronunciation challenge. At the Goethals Bridge, new and old, some use a short “o,” others a long “o.” The third project is the New New York Bridge, which is to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge. It is pronounced “NOO-nyawk.” ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/amtrak-penn-station-disruptions.html,"TRENTON — Amtrak officials said on Friday that overhauling the tracks and rail equipment at Pennsylvania Station in New York would require two or three significant disruptions to commuting schedules over the summer. Precisely when the disruptions would occur and how long they would last, however, the officials could not say. They said they would meet next week with officials of commuter railroads in New Jersey and New York to decide how to schedule the track closings to limit their effects on the 600,000 train riders who pass through Penn Station each weekday. Amtrak should be ready to lay out its plan for the weekday disruptions by the week of May 8,, the railroad’s chief executive, Charles W. Moorman, told lawmakers at a hearing in Trenton. Mr. Moorman said Amtrak’s goal was to finish the most complicated repairs by Labor Day, and to then resume working on the tracks only at night and on weekends. He said he did not know how many weekdays would be disrupted but that “it’s certainly not going to be every day this summer.” Mr. Moorman said the disruptions would affect riders who use Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road, all of which share the tracks and platforms at Penn Station, North America’s busiest rail terminal. Amtrak, as the landlord at Penn Station, has drawn up a schedule for the work and will give officials with the commuter railroads a chance next week to respond to it and to suggest changes, Mr. Moorman said. “We are eager to work collaboratively together with New Jersey Transit,” he said. “In general, our organizations have a very good relationship at the ground level.” Steven Santoro, New Jersey Transit’s executive director, testified at the hearing after the Amtrak officials. He told lawmakers that his staff had just received the Amtrak proposal and had not had a chance to assess it. The plan to schedule track work at the station on weekdays is a change for Amtrak, whose traditional approach has been to limit work to late nights and weekends. But a series of derailments and other problems at and around the station in the past several weeks prompted Amtrak officials to alter their strategy. Assemblyman John McKeon, a Democrat, referred to a timeline of recent train troubles displayed on screens in the hearing room as a “30-day nightmare.” He said it was hypocritical of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to blame Amtrak for the problems, given that Mr. Christie, a Republican, had canceled a project meant to double the capacity for commuter trains between New Jersey and New York City. “The fact that the governor has the temerity to blame anyone but himself, pointing at Amtrak, is astounding to me,” Mr. McKeon said. On Thursday, Mr. Christie told reporters that he had been right to threaten to withhold payments to Amtrak for maintaining the station because Amtrak had accepted responsibility for the derailments and had decided to accelerate repairs. Mr. Santoro said that Mr. Christie’s goal in making the threat was to get Amtrak’s attention. “I think that attention’s been got,” Mr. Santoro said. ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/us/florence-finch-dead-coast-guard-war-hero.html,"Florence Finch was an atypical hometown hero. For nearly 50 years after World War II, virtually no one outside of her family knew that she was a highly decorated Coast Guard veteran and a former prisoner of war whose exploits had been buried in time. “Women don’t tell war stories like men do,” her daughter, Betty Murphy, of Ithaca, N.Y., said recently. And even on those rare occasions when she recalled her heroics in the Philippines — supplying fuel to the Filipino underground, sabotaging supplies destined for the Japanese occupiers, smuggling food to starving American prisoners and surviving torture after she was captured — Mrs. Finch did so with the utmost modesty. “I feel very humble,” she once said, “because my activities in the war effort were trivial compared with those of the people who gave their lives for their country.” It was perhaps reflective of that modesty that when she died on Dec. 8 at 101 in an Ithaca nursing home, the news did not travel widely. Newspapers in central New York carried a brief obituary, but her death went unreported virtually everywhere else. It was only after the announcement by the Coast Guard on Thursday that she would be buried with full military honors on Saturday at Pleasant Grove Cemetery in Cayuga Heights, N.Y., that word of her death spread nationwide. Indeed, the almost five-month delay in her memorial owed something to Mrs. Finch’s solicitous nature. Near death, she had made it clear that she did not want her funeral to disrupt her relatives’ Christmas holidays or to make mourners travel during a dark and icy Southern Tier winter. (Besides, she relished the annual resurgence wrought by spring.) So it was put off. The funeral is to be held in Ithaca, with the military honors coming afterward, a ceremony befitting this Philippine-born daughter of an American father and Filipino mother — one who, in 1947, received the Medal of Freedom (the forerunner of today’s Presidential Medal of Freedom), the nation’s highest award to a civilian. When the Japanese occupied the Philippines from 1942 to 1945, Mrs. Finch posed as a Filipino, but she became a United States citizen after the war. “Because she was over 18, she could have chosen to be American or Filipino,” Ms. Murphy said. “When the Japanese landed, she chose to be mum, but in her heart she had chosen to be an American.” Mrs. Finch was born Loring May Ebersole on Oct. 11, 1915, in Santiago, on Luzon Island in the northern Philippines. (It is unclear how her first name became Florence.) Her father, Charles, had fought in the Philippines for the Army during the Spanish-American War and remained there after it was over. Her mother was the former Maria Hermosa. Betty, as Mrs. Finch was known all her life, graduated from high school and was hired as a stenographer at Army Intelligence headquarters in Manila under Maj. E. C. Engelhart. While working there, she met Charles E. Smith, a Navy chief electrician’s mate. They married in August 1941, a few months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on Dec. 7. When the war did begin, Mr. Smith reported to his PT boat. He died on Feb. 8, 1942, trying to resupply American and Filipino troops trapped on Corregidor Island and the Bataan Peninsula. Five weeks earlier, Manila had fallen to the Japanese. Mrs. Finch (then Mrs. Smith) convinced the occupying forces that she was Filipino and, armed with superior penmanship, wangled a job writing gas rationing vouchers for the now Japanese-run Philippine Liquid Fuel Distributing Union. Unbeknown to her employer, however, she was actually collaborating with the Philippine resistance movement. Her job enabled her to divert precious fuel supplies to the underground and help sabotage shipments to the Japanese. After she learned of her husband’s death, her efforts became even more vigorous. (She was honored by the Philippine government in 2011.) Meanwhile, Major Englehart (he became a lieutenant colonel) managed to get word to her that he had been captured and that he and fellow war prisoners were being maltreated. She helped smuggle food, medicine, soap and clothing to them in a prison until she was caught. Confined to a two-by-four-foot cell, she was interrogated and then tortured, enduring repeated shocks from electrical clamps on her fingers. She never talked. She was tried and sentenced to three years’ hard labor at the Women’s Correctional Institution in Mandaluyong, just outside Manila. When she was finally freed by American troops on Feb. 10, 1945, she weighed 80 pounds. Rather than remain in her native country, she moved to Buffalo, where her father’s sister lived. She joined the Coast Guard Women’s Reserve, or the SPARs (a contraction of the Coast Guard motto “Semper Paratus” — Always Ready). She enlisted, she said, to avenge her husband. When her superiors learned of her wartime exploits, she was awarded the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Ribbon; the Coast Guard described her as the first woman to receive the decoration. The Medal of Freedom was bestowed for meritorious service. After the war ended, she was discharged as a seaman second class in 1946 and enrolled in secretarial school in New York City, where she met and married an Army veteran, Robert Finch. A chemist, he was hired by Agway, the agricultural products supplier, and moved the family to Ithaca. Mr. Finch died in 1968. In addition to her daughter, Betty, Mrs. Finch is survived by a son, Bob; a sister, Olive Keats; six grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. As Mrs. Finch was rearing her children and working as a secretary at Cornell University, her neighbors never suspected that they were in the presence of a war hero. In the early 1990s, though, she was rediscovered by the military after she completed a government questionnaire that she had received in conjunction with plans to erect the Women in Military Service for America Memorial in Washington. The Coast Guard named a building on Sand Island in Hawaii in her honor in 1995. Ms. Murphy decided to alert the news media about the building dedication, noting that her mother would be in attendance. “It was the first anyone knew,” Ms. Murphy said. “I figured it was time. And when she came home and people met her at the bus station, she was flabbergasted.” In 2015, the Coast Guard’s official blog said of Mrs. Finch, “Of the thousands of women who have served with honor in the United States Coast Guard, one stands out for her bravery and devotion to duty.” Her wartime legacy will be publicly honored again on Saturday by a military honor guard. But privately her heroism endured without medals, plaques or flags. “It had not defined her,” Ms. Murphy said, “but it defined how she lived her life.” ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/nyregion/a-hospital-no-longer-afloat-but-buoyant-with-memories.html,"Jeffrey Delgado, an aspiring archivist from Queens College, has been telling friends that he went through yellowing documents and old photographs for an exhibit showcasing the history of the Floating Hospital. They all asked the same question: “Is it still on a boat?” The answer, as he learned from the some of the newest records he examined, is no. The Floating Hospital kept its name when it decommissioned its last vessel 15 years ago. But the material Mr. Delgado went through was high and dry in Long Island City, Queens, the Floating Hospital’s base since it moved to a permanent home on land. Now the finds from the Floating Hospital’s archives can be seen in an exhibition that he and two other archivists-in-training assembled under the supervision of full-fledged archivists at Citibank and the Queens Library. For generations, the Floating Hospital made medical care as carefree as a day at the beach by giving children a boat ride that included a checkup. It traced its origins to 1866, with rented barges, and its getaway mission to 1872, when The New York Times reported on newsboys playing in a park and observed that they would do well to get some fresh-air relief from the crowded, fetid city that they plied every day. Sean T. Granahan, the president and general counsel of the Floating Hospital, said it had 100,000 photographs and other evidence “of our epic 150-year journey through health care” that needed to be reviewed, assessed and preserved. The archive project came about when officials at Citibank put the Floating Hospital in touch with the Queens Library, which works with community-based organizations in Queens “that have amazing material but don’t have archivists to make them available to the public,” said Natalie Milbrodt, the library’s director of metadata services and the director of its Queens Memory program. The library also maintains the Citi Center for Culture Queens Library Fellowship for graduate students like Mr. Delgado. So the Floating Hospital became an assignment for the three recipients of this year’s fellowships. In addition to Mr. Delgado, they are Regina Carra, who like Mr. Delgado is working on dual master’s degrees, one in history, the other in library science, and Pamela Griffin-Hansen, a candidate for a master’s degree in library science and archives at St. John’s University. Each received a stipend of $1,000. Kerri Anne Burke, the global curator of Citigroup’s Citi Heritage Collection, said the students made recommendations on how to take care of the Floating Hospital’s files and artifacts, and then went to work designing the exhibit. Mr. Delgado and Ms. Carra worked on the layout, while Ms. Griffin-Hansen prepared labels to go with the photographs and the items they had chosen. The exhibition fills six display cases near the food court in the Citigroup building at One Court Square in Long Island City. Among the items is a bell from the Helen C. Juilliard II, the second of the Floating Hospital’s five vessels. Seeing it in the display case prompted a question: Did they ring it? No, Mr. Delgado said: “We’re archivists.” Another find was a guest log from 1899, with the names of everyone who boarded the ship. Mr. Delgado remembered what flashed through his mind as he picked up the log: “I have to be careful with this book right now — it’s really fragile.” “We were jumping for joy because we didn’t think we’d find anything so well preserved,” he said. “I checked for water damage, like a good archivist should.” But there was not much. “They didn’t find any mold or the kinds of things you often find when you’re looking at a collection for the first time,” said Ms. Milbrodt of the Queens Library. She said that the Floating Hospital had “kept their materials in really good condition.” They also caught up on the organization’s recent past. Terrorism doomed the floating part of the Floating Hospital. The organization abandoned ship after the 9/11 attacks. It turned its last vessel, anchored off Lower Manhattan, into an emergency clinic as the twin towers fell. In time, the vessel was moved to Brooklyn, where it was used as offices; the medical care was provided at clinics around the city that the Floating Hospital had opened in the 1990s. The Floating Hospital was also struggling financially, with $6 million in debt, according to Mr. Granahan. The group sold the ship, actually a barge, and refocused on land-based ways to provide care that would generate sufficient reimbursements. It now describes itself as the largest charity health care provider for families in the city’s homeless shelters and domestic-violence centers. Not everything the archivists-in-training turned up went into the exhibit. “I found a lot of blueprints of Seaside Hospital before it was a thing,” Mr. Delgado said, referring to a nursery and medical care facility in New Dorp, Staten Island, that the Floating Hospital ran from 1881 until the mid-1960s. “I wanted to incorporate them,” he said, but they were too big to digitize and too fragile to mount in the display cases.

Buyers are taking their time before signing on the dotted line, and sales agents and brokers have had to get more creative in drawing attention to their listings. “We’ve seen buyers come see an apartment four or five times and they’re still on the fence,” said Steven Rutter, director of Stribling Marketing Associates, a division of Stribling & Associates. “There’s no sense of urgency.” Luxury, of course, is a relative term when it comes to New York City, where the average price of a condominium keeps rising and is currently $3.2 million, according to the latest report from CityRealty.com.

Mr. Miller calculates that 6,000 apartments from new development, many in the million- and multimillion-dollar price range, hit the market in Manhattan in 2016. He estimated that 3,000 units would be introduced this year, and another 2,000 units in 2018. Even though some buyers are taking their time in sorting through this oversupply, they are still willing to sign contracts. And prices are generally stable, though with some exceptions. Apartments priced in the $1 million to $3 million range may prompt a bidding war, but most homes $5 million and under are selling well. Many offerings over $10 million have been discounted already, and some can be negotiated down as much as 30 percent more, brokers say. The market was off to a good start this year. There were 330 contracts signed in the first quarter of 2017, a 33 percent increase from the same period last year, according to a report from Olshan Realty Inc., which tracks sales in this price range. This is evidence that buyers are pulling the trigger, even if they are taking their time about it. Still, brokers have to find new ways to make their offerings stand out. To introduce the sale of an $11.75 million, four-bedroom penthouse in Midtown, Tara King-Brown and Amy Williamson, two associate brokers from the Corcoran Group, ditched the evening cocktail party, the industry’s tried-and-tested event, and instead held a morning meditation class in the building’s common-area yoga room. About a dozen people, mostly brokers, attended the class, which was run by MNDFL, a firm that runs several meditation studios throughout the city. After a 30-minute session of deep breathing and reflection as the sun rose over the East River, the group got a tour of the penthouse at 305 East 51st Street. “What’s fantastic about this place is the view and morning light so we wanted the brokers to feel it for themselves,” Ms. King-Brown said. “Hosting a different type of networking event is necessary to stand out, especially since buyers have so much to choose from.” To draw attention to a $6.995 million, four-bedroom condo at 6 Cortlandt Alley, Susan Wires, a Stribling saleswoman, held a continuing education class run by the firm TitleVest called “Condominium Essentials” for agents and brokers in the residence. She said it helped “get a lot of eyes on this building since we’re a small, new development, not a large tower that gets a lot of attention.” Fredrik Eklund, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman and a cast member of the television show “Million Dollar Listing New York,” recently invited 55 so-called Instagram influencers, or those with the most followers in the city, to a four-bedroom, $20.75 million home at Madison Square Park Tower. Ripping a page out of fashion marketing, where social media stars are invited to post photos and comment on designer wear and store openings, Mr. Eklund allowed the group to post photos from the apartment on the 56th floor. He admitted that the move was a little risky, since he didn’t check to see what everyone was posting. “But if you’re an Instagram influencer, you’re creative, a good photographer,” so you’re guaranteed a good shot, he said. “They were happy to have access to an apartment with a gorgeous view, plus I reached a non-real-estate audience.” The event generated more than 100 postings on the building, eliciting over 150,000 interactions (likes, comments, views) and reached over five million Instagram users who follow the invited social media influencers. The building’s own Instagram page immediately signed up about 1,000 new followers after the event, now totaling about 14,600. Mr. Eklund said a Chinese fashion designer who was in town in February for fashion week made an appointment to see an apartment after the Instagram blitz. He said many younger buyers check information on a property through social media even before looking at the building’s website. Many developers and brokers like to turn a model showroom or listing into a temporary art gallery and give parties, an easy guest list to compile because buyers of high-end art and real estate tend to overlap. Vickey Barron, a broker at Douglas Elliman, said she prefers smaller get-togethers. To drive attention to a Chelsea condominium building, she organized a small breakfast with the developer and several brokers. “I gave my friends access to someone they wouldn’t otherwise have,” she said. “The result is, though, you’re pulling people together that help you get a contract signed.” To get a jump on selling new homes built by the Farrell Building Company in the Hamptons, Andrew Azoulay, also an Elliman broker, opened a pop-up showroom in TriBeCa, thought to be the first for Hamptons real estate. He is organizing weekly events, which include child-friendly gatherings like movie nights and a block party. The kicker: a free helicopter ride for potential buyers. So far, he has used the helicopter only once, to show a couple a nearly $16 million home in Water Mill, N.Y. The couple didn’t take that particular home, Mr. Azoulay said, but are interested in a custom-built one from the developer. Mr. Azoulay has sold 10 homes since the start of the year. “And the season is just starting,” he said. ",New York Times,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/opinion/after-hate-crimes-victims-stuck-with-the-bill.html,"This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of President Trump. Kanwal Khurana loved living in Cleveland. He and his wife had moved from the suburbs to an apartment in the city in December. “It’s beautiful,” he said. “You can see the whole downtown.” But less than two months later, Mr. Khurana and his wife had just parked their car across the street from the building when they heard someone say, “go back to your own country.” The next morning, they discovered that someone had slashed all four of their tires. Mr. Khurana, 63, is retired from his job writing contracts for Cuyahoga County, and his wife is a homemaker. They help their son pay his tuition at Kent State. They have car insurance, but still had to come up with a $500 co-payment to have their car towed and repaired, plus the fee to rent a car in the meantime. The Khuranas reached out to city and state officials for help paying their bills. They discovered, as many victims of hate and harassment do, that getting financial assistance isn’t always easy. Victims of hate crimes can sue perpetrators under state and federal hate crime or other civil rights laws for compensatory damages and, in some cases, punitive damages as well. But first they need lawyers. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law recently began operating a hotline at 844-9-NO-HATE (844-966-4283), through which volunteers can help callers find legal representation. But beyond that, “there is no real comprehensive network around the country” to connect victims of hate crimes or harassment with lawyers, said Betsy Shuman-Moore, the director of the Hate Crime Project at the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights. In the Chicago area, she added, legal resources for hate crime victims have actually decreased in recent years. When the perpetrator remains unidentified, as in the Khuranas’ case, a lawsuit is usually not an option. Some states, however, have funds set aside to help crime victims pay their expenses. Mr. Khurana wrote to the mayor of Cleveland, whose staff suggested he contact the Ohio attorney general’s office. The office maintains a victims’ compensation fund, but Mr. Khurana was told he was not eligible for compensation because he had not been physically injured. The office sent him a booklet titled “Picking Up the Pieces” with information about crime victims’ rights. Sometimes, friends or family — or strangers — step in to help hate crime victims. After Cristina Alfonso-Zea was attacked last year in the parking lot outside her home in Las Vegas by assailants who hit her in the head, stole her wallet and phone and wrote slurs on her car, her friend set up a GoFundMe campaign to help her. Ms. Alfonso-Zea, a veteran, already had post-traumatic stress disorder, which was exacerbated by the attack. The money from the campaign helped her fix her car and move away from the area where she was attacked. The campaign also helped her psychologically, she said: “It made me realize that there’s really good people out there that really care about you, even if they don’t know you.” She wishes hate crime victims got more information on compensation funds and other resources. “In Las Vegas, they teach us about flash flooding, they teach us abandonment of a rabbit is a felony,” she said, “but at the same time they don’t really teach us about having funds like that or having a safe place that you can go to.” Mrs. Khurana ultimately sold some of her jewelry to pay for their car expenses. The Khuranas don’t plan to move, but they are more careful when they go out in their neighborhood now, and they park their car in a different spot that costs $5 a day. Mr. Khurana is grateful he and his wife weren’t hurt — he thinks of the shooting of two Indian immigrants, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, in Kansas in February. “That night anything could have happened,” he said. “We still feel lucky.” If you have experienced, witnessed or read about a hate crime or incident of bias or harassment, you can use this form to send information about the incident to This Week in Hate and other partners in the Documenting Hate project.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/europe/chechnya-russia-attacks-gays.html,"GROZNY, Russia — It was supposed to be a night out. But for the young man who calls himself Maksim, as for scores of other gay men arrested in a pogrom this month in Russia’s Chechnya region, it pivoted into nearly two weeks of beatings and torture. Maksim said it had started with a chat room conversation with “a very good old friend who is also gay,” and who suggested that they meet at an apartment. When Maksim arrived, however, he was greeted not by his friend but by agents who beat him. Later, they strapped him to a chair, attached electrical wires to his hands with alligator clips and began an interrogation. “They yelled, ‘Who else do you know?’” Maksim said, and zapped him with current from time to time. “It was unbearably painful; I was hanging on with my last strength,” he added. “But I didn’t tell them anything.” Gay men have never had an easy life in Chechnya. But the targeted, collective punishment of gays that began last month under its pro-Kremlin leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, is a new turn in the region’s long history of rights abuses. Novaya Gazeta, an opposition newspaper, first reported the pogrom, saying that at least 100 gay men had been arrested and three killed in the roundup. Human Rights Watch corroborated those findings. The sweep has been widely condemned by Western governments, the United Nations and rights groups. Activists in Russia have set up an underground network to spirit the victims out of Chechnya and to protect them from potentially violent reprisals from their families and others. The victims use assumed names in their everyday dealings. The following account is based on interviews with Maksim, who is in his 20s, and two other gay men who were detained by Chechen security agents. Homosexuality is taboo in Chechnya and the mostly Muslim surrounding areas of the Caucasus region in southern Russia. “This society is highly homophobic,” said Ekaterina L. Sokiryanskaya, Russia project director for the International Crisis Group and an authority on Chechnya. “Homosexuality is condemned. It is believed Islam considers it a great sin.” Nevertheless, before the crackdown, gay men in Chechnya could at least lead social lives, if heavily closeted ones, Maksim said. They met largely in private chat rooms on social networking sites with names like the Village or What the Mountains Are Silent About. “When two gay men meet, they don’t tell one another their true names,” Maksim said. Men met at cafes or at apartments rented for a night, he said. “Nobody suspected my sexual orientation, not even my best friends.” The crackdown began after GayRussia, a rights group based in Moscow, applied for permits for gay pride parades in the Caucasus region, prompting counterprotests by religious groups, the men said. In Chechnya, it became something even worse — a mass “prophylactic” cleansing of homosexuals, the security service agents told the gay men as they rounded them up. The men were held for as little as a day or as long as several weeks, according to Human Rights Watch and to interviews with gay men who later escaped the region. Some “returned to their families barely alive from beatings,” said Tanya Lokshina, Russia program director for Human Rights Watch. Among the fatalities documented by the organization were one man who succumbed during torture and two others who died in “honor killings” by relatives after the police released them. “Human Rights Watch has been getting numerous reports about attacks by security services under Ramzan Kadyrov’s control, and those reports are extremely disturbing,” Ms. Lokshina said. “This is another opportunity to reinforce the culture of fear.” The Chechen authorities’ response to the global outrage over the pogrom has provoked new incredulity. In a telephone interview, Mr. Kadyrov’s spokesman, Alvi Karimov, said the reports of an anti-gay pogrom had to be false because such men did not exist in Chechnya. “In Grozny, have you ever noticed people who, by their appearance or manners, resemble people who are oriented in the wrong way?” Mr. Karimov asked. “A policy is developed for a problem,” he said, referring to a report that said the arrests were official policy. “I can officially say there is no policy because there is no problem. If there were a problem, there would be a policy.” In a televised meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Wednesday, Mr. Kadyrov characterized as “libelous” news reports that the security services in Chechnya had been persecuting gay men. And on Thursday, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told journalists that the Russian authorities had found no evidence that the Chechen police had arrested gay men. But it quickly became clear to Maksim and the other men that the Chechen authorities were applying the same tactics used by Russia and by Mr. Kadyrov to suppress an Islamist insurgency in the region over the past decade. Security service agents took to posing as gay men looking for dates on the Village and in other chat rooms, or persuaded those they had already captured to lure acquaintances, those arrested said in interviews. Fear spread among gay Chechens. “If they caught him, they will get to me,” said a 20-year-old student who identified himself as Ilya and who was interviewed at a safe location outside Chechnya. Ilya fled days before the police showed up at his home, he learned later. The authorities briefly detained another young man, who identified himself as Nohcho, after a friend informed on him during an interrogation. “I don’t blame him,” Nohcho said of the friend. “We are not heroes. We’re just gay guys. They starve you. They shock you.” That, it seems, is essentially what happened to Maksim, who had been corresponding with his gay acquaintance for some time. “One day, he suggested we meet for a drink,” Maksim said. “And because we knew each other a long time, I did not suspect he would be capable of something like this.” When Maksim entered the apartment where they had agreed to meet, security officers roughed him up. Five other men were already in the apartment, lured by the same ruse, he said. His account of the deception used to detain him was consistent with others documented by Human Rights Watch and with the accounts of the two other gay men interviewed separately for this article. All six of the men in the apartment were transferred to a makeshift cell in an abandoned building, where they were tortured with electricity one by one, Maksim said. After 11 days, he was released to a male relative, who was told that Maksim was gay. The security officers told the captives’ male relatives that, if they had any honor, they would kill the young men, Maksim and Ilya said. Maksim’s father threatened to beat him but refrained when his son showed him the bruises he already had. Instead his father said, “I should kill you.” Fearing for his life, Maksim turned to a gay rights group, the Russian LGBT Network, based in St. Petersburg, which has established an emergency, round-the-clock volunteer group to help gay men escape the region. To reassure the victims they are trying to help, the activists have taken extraordinary precautions, operating virtually as a partisan cell behind enemy lines, though they have done nothing illegal under Russian law. “These people don’t trust anybody,” said Olga Baranova, director of the Moscow Community Center, a support group for gays that is part of the volunteer network helping gay men flee Chechnya. After arriving at the safe location outside Chechnya, several young men said they had suspected that the volunteer group was also a trap but had no other option but to accept the help, Ms. Baranova said. “They say, ‘We didn’t believe you were real,’” she said. “‘We thought this was the last effort to round up whoever was left.’” The network bought airplane tickets for Chechen gay men, found safe houses and arranged for doctors to treat those who had been badly beaten. “Gays in Chechnya and the North Caucasus are in lethal danger,” Igor Kochetkov, director of the Russian LGBT Network, said in a telephone interview. “People whose partners are detained have every reason to believe they will be arrested. It is very hard not to name the names under torture.” ",New York Times,1
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/opinion/when-hate-leads-to-depression.html,"This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of President Trump. Women afraid to go out in public. College students struggling in school. Employees feeling unsafe on the job. People of all walks of life experiencing anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. These are some of the mental and emotional effects of what advocates say is a wave of hate crimes and racist harassment that started during President Trump’s campaign. Muslims, immigrants and members of other groups targeted with violence and intimidation are seeking help to deal with lingering trauma. But mental health groups and advocates are finding that the specialized support they need doesn’t always exist. The Family and Youth Institute, which studies the mental health needs of American Muslims, has seen more reports of anxiety and depression since the campaign began, as well as more people seeking therapy and asking questions about mental health. It’s not only victims of hate crimes who are affected, according to Dr. Sameera Ahmed, the director of the institute — anti-Muslim harassment and political rhetoric are having a psychological impact on many American Muslims, regardless of whether they have been personally targeted. Muslims in America have been in “perpetual crisis mode” in recent years, dealing with the aftermath of the 2015 Paris attacks, followed by President Trump’s campaign, election, inauguration and travel ban, said Dr. Rania Awaad, the director of the Muslims and Mental Health Lab at Stanford University and the clinical director of the San Francisco Bay Area branch of the Khalil Center, a Muslim counseling center. In November, the center offered a support group for young people, some of whom had been harassed at school, but their parents wouldn’t leave — they wanted help too. Eventually, “they went to a corner of the conference room and created their own little support group,” Dr. Awaad said. Not everyone can find support in the wake of a hate crime. Dr. Prabhjot Singh, now the chair of the department of health system design and global health at the Mount Sinai Health System, felt angry and depressed after he was attacked in New York in 2005, when he was in graduate school. He reached out to mental health services at his university, but they weren’t much help, since they were geared toward people with severe psychiatric illness. When he was attacked again a few years later, his anger, depression and sense of isolation deepened. He dealt with them by throwing himself into work. He also began practicing his Sikh religion more actively, growing his beard and waking up before dawn to meditate. Then, in 2013, he was attacked by a group of young men who called him “Osama” and “terrorist” and punched him in the face, breaking his jaw. That attack got significant media attention, and people began to email him asking for advice after they or their loved ones experienced hate crimes. The volume of recent messages has been a sign for him that hate crimes are on the rise. “I just hear it in my inbox,” he said. Sometimes Dr. Singh can help the people who write to him, and sometimes he can’t. He sees a lack of resources for people who have been victims of hate crimes: “I don’t think there’s really a good way for people who have had this type of experience to find useful community.” Some nonprofit groups are mobilizing to offer mental health services for people affected by hate crimes or harassment, who may have unique needs that conventional therapy doesn’t always address. Staff at the YWCA of Kalamazoo in western Michigan found that while people who had experienced hate crimes could find individual counseling in the area, which is home to many immigrants working in the agriculture industry, there were no services for people feeling the indirect effects of hate crimes against people of their race or religion, said Jessica Glynn, the director of law and policy at the YWCA. To fill the gap, the YWCA of Kalamazoo earlier this year created a support group for survivors, witnesses and others affected by hate crimes, and plans to create more groups in the area if needed. Established a year and a half ago, the Bay Area Khalil Center has already expanded to include a second branch, and a third is in the works. In addition to support groups, the center offers individual therapy with Muslim therapists. Working with a therapist who shares their religion means patients “don’t have to start from scratch explaining things,” said Dr. Awaad. The Maryland chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations holds free self-defense workshops and recently conducted its first training on how to respond to an active shooter. Learning preparedness skills can help people cope with anxiety and fear, said Dr. Zainab Chaudry, the council’s Maryland outreach manager. “We can’t control external factors in our environment,” she added, “but we can control how we respond.” Since the attack in 2013, Dr. Singh has discovered that little research or advice exists to help doctors identify and treat patients who have experienced hate crimes. He’s begun work on a guide, perhaps drawing on techniques developed to treat survivors of domestic and sexual violence. Dr. Singh saw the election of President Trump as the latest symptom of a deep national confusion that he’s not sure how to address. But he takes comfort in his Sikh practice: “finding that stillness, finding that discipline to remember that we know each other far more than we say we do. We are all connected.” If you have experienced, witnessed or read about a hate crime or incident of bias or harassment, you can use this form to send information about the incident to This Week in Hate and other partners in the Documenting Hate project.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/world/europe/un-chechnya-gay-men-killing-abuse.html,"LONDON — United Nations experts demanded on Thursday that Chechnya halt the abduction, detention, beating and killing of gay and bisexual men, after weeks of reports about violent repression there. “These are acts of persecution and violence on an unprecedented scale in the region and constitute serious violations of the obligations of the Russian Federation under international human rights law,” the experts, a panel of five that advises the United Nations Human Rights Council, said in a statement. The experts noted that much of the abuse was reported to have taken place at an unofficial detention center near Argun, a town about 10 miles east of Grozny, the Chechen capital. “The arrested men are subjected to physical and verbal abuse, torture including with electric shocks, beatings, insults and humiliations,” the experts wrote. “They are forced to give contact details of other gay people and threatened with having their sexual orientation disclosed to their family and community — a move which could put them at risk of ‘honor killings.’” Since last month, reports have circulated within Russia that local militias and security forces have been hunting down, detaining and abusing men they perceived to be gay or bisexual. On April 1, a leading opposition newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, confirmed those reports, citing Russian federal law enforcement officials, who blamed the local authorities. Dozens of men are said to have been rounded up, but precise numbers — including a death toll — are not available. Since 2007, Chechnya — a mountainous republic within the Russian Federation and the site of a long-running insurgency that Russia eventually crushed — has been led by a strongman, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, who has been granted significant leeway in exchange for his allegiance to the Kremlin. In restive Muslim regions in southern Russia, Mr. Putin has empowered local leaders to enforce their interpretation of traditional Muslim values, partly in an effort to co-opt Islamist extremism, which has largely been driven underground. A spokesman for Mr. Kadyrov issued a chilling denial on April 1, after the initial reports surfaced. “You cannot arrest or repress people who just don’t exist in the republic,” the spokesman, Alvi Karimov, told the Interfax news agency. “If such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return.” The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on April 3 that he could not confirm the newspaper’s account but added: “This is something for law enforcement to deal with. This is not on the Kremlin’s agenda.” According to Novaya Gazeta, the persecution intensified after a group based in Moscow, GayRussia.ru, applied for permits to stage gay-pride parades in four cities in the North Caucasus region. The group did not apply for a permit in Chechnya, but it did in another Muslim area in the region, Kabardino-Balkaria. The mere application there — denied, as usual — prompted an anti-gay counterdemonstration. “In Chechnya, the command was given for a ‘prophylactic sweep,’ and it went as far as real murders,” Novaya Gazeta reported. As part of the sweep, investigators posed as men looking for dates or sex. Gay men have begun deleting online accounts or even fleeing the region, the newspaper reported. The United Nations experts urged the authorities to end the persecution, saying that Chechens were “living in a climate of fear fueled by homophobic speeches by local authorities.” They also demanded that the authorities immediately release all detainees, thoroughly investigate the anti-gay campaign and hold the persecutors accountable. The experts condemned statements by Chechen officials suggesting that gay people should be hunted down and killed. “The Russian Federation must officially state that it does not tolerate any form of incitement to violence, social stigmatization of homosexuality or hate speech, and does not condone discrimination or violence against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity,” their statement said. There was little suggestion that Moscow would give the experts’ warnings much heed. Russia has been widely criticized for cracking down on the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. In 2013, a law criminalized giving minors materials promoting “nontraditional” sexual relationships — a statute that has been used to justify the arrests of gay rights activists. The experts are Vitit Muntarbhorn of Thailand, who focuses on sexual orientation and gender identity; Sètondji Roland Adjovi of Benin, an expert on arbitrary detention; Agnès Callamard of France, an authority on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Nils Melzer of Switzerland, who focuses on torture and other cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment or punishment; and David Kaye of the United States, a specialist in freedom of opinion and expression.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/europe/dutch-men-hold-hands.html,"From Amsterdam to New York, London to Havana, Dutch men across the world held hands this week to show solidarity with a gay couple who say they were brutally beaten in Arnhem, the Netherlands. The outpouring of support came after the married couple, Jasper Vernes-Sewratan and Ronnie Sewratan-Vernes, said they were attacked by a gang of youths while holding hands on their way home from a party early Sunday. According to a statement the Arnhem police posted on Facebook, the two said they had been attacked by men wielding bolt cutters; one had some of his teeth smashed out. Prosecutors said five teenage suspects would be charged on Thursday with serious bodily harm. The authorities are still investigating the motivation for the attack, which the victims have characterized as a hate crime. The beating caused particular outrage in the Netherlands, which has long prided itself on its tolerance. Amsterdam, the capital, has been a haven for sexual minorities for centuries, and it has marketed itself as the “gay capital of Europe.” Homosexuality was removed from the Dutch criminal code in 1811, and the Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize gay marriage, with the first ceremonies in 2001. Gay rights are supported across the political spectrum in the Netherlands. The attack comes as the country has been grappling with growing anti-immigrant sentiment, fueled in part by the far-right leader Geert Wilders, who has railed against immigrants and Muslims in particular, saying that “Islamization” is a threat to European liberal values, including gay rights and women’s rights. The populist party of Mr. Wilders, who likens himself to Donald J. Trump, came second in recent Dutch elections. He is an ideological heir of Pim Fortuyn, a right-wing politician who derided Islam, immigration and multiculturalism, and who was openly gay. Mr. Fortuyn was killed in 2002, days before his party placed second in national elections. The Dutch news media quoted Gerald Roethof, a lawyer for one of the suspects, as saying that the couple had instigated the fight by acting aggressively toward the teenagers, an accusation the two vehemently denied. Mr. Roethof also denied that bolt cutters had been used, or that the men were targeted because they were gay. But he said his client had acknowledged punching one of the men in the mouth. Mr. Sewratan-Vernes, 31, told  the Dutch public broadcaster NOS that he and his husband seldom held hands in public for fear of provoking an attack. “But we’d had a nice evening, it was late, and we thought we were alone,” he said. Then suddenly six to eight youths set upon them, he said, and “before I knew it, I was on the ground fighting with three men on top of me.” After the attack, which Mr. Vernes-Sewratan, 35, recounted on his Facebook page, Dutch politicians, actors, police officers, soldiers and athletes took to the streets, holding hands. Hundreds of people marched through the streets of Amsterdam to show their support for gay rights. The expressions of support grew after the journalist Barbara Berend appealed on Twitter for men, whether straight or gay, to walk hand in hand. Dozens heeded her call and posted photographs of themselves doing just that, often with the hashtag #allemannenhandinhand (all men holding hands). Two high-profile politicians — Alexander Pechtold, leader of the liberal-democratic party D66, and Wouter Koolmees, a lawmaker in the party — showed up for coalition talks on Monday holding hands. COC Netherlands, an advocacy group for gay rights based in Amsterdam, said the number of reported cases of violence against gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people had increased to 1,600 in 2015 from about 400 in 2009. Of the 1,600, nine resulted in convictions for discrimination-related offenses, including hate crimes. It cautioned, however, that the increase in reporting could also be a result of greater awareness of the issue. ",New York Times,1
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/02/nyregion/a-day-out-leaves-two-transgender-women-living-in-fear.html,"Nayra and Gabriela don’t go out much these days, and not just because the two roommates are homebodies. When they venture outside their apartment in Queens, their hesitation is caused as much by emotional wounds as by physical injuries. The two friends are trans women, and though their Jackson Heights neighborhood has a reputation as a welcoming community for gays and lesbians, hate crimes against transgender women have alarmed many in the area. On the afternoon of March 17, the two women were entering a McDonald’s restaurant on Roosevelt Avenue when they heard a man screaming behind them. When they turned around, they said, he began hurling insults. “He called us prostitutes, faggots, bitches,” said Gabriela, 33, who, like her friend, spoke on the condition that her last name not be published because of the nature of the assault as well as lingering fear. “I looked at him and said, ‘Girl, this man is crazy.’ He wanted to hurt us.” Within seconds, the encounter escalated from insults to injuries. The man rushed them, knocking them to the ground as he pummeled Nayra, whose ankle was fractured in the fall. Gabriella said that she had pounced on him but that he had gotten up, grabbed a broken umbrella and used it to beat her on her face and hands. When he tried to escape, Gabriella chased him, grabbing at the waistband of his pants and slowing him down until the police arrived and took him into custody. No bystanders intervened during the attack, they said. Now, what has been called a hate crime by the police has turned a neighborhood they love into one they fear. “I can’t go out and see too many people,” Nayra, 31, said. “If I have appointments, I’ll take a taxi and come back home. I don’t want to see anybody. If I do, I freeze. If I go outside to smoke and I hear a man’s voice, I panic.” Patrick Omeara, 38, of Oakdale, N.Y., was arrested and faces various charges, including assault as a hate crime. He could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Howard Turman, did not respond to several voice messages requesting comment. The case is in the pretrial stage, and the next court date is scheduled for Tuesday. Jackson Heights has come a long way since skinheads lured Julio Rivera, a gay man, into a schoolyard and killed him. That 1990 attack galvanized activists and residents, and led to the establishment of the borough’s gay pride parade and a political club that has promoted laws and policies helping gay, lesbian and transgender people. Yet the attacks on trans women — three this year and 16 in 2016, according to local advocates — are an unsettling reminder of the work still to be done. “People have this idea that New York City is free of violence and progressive,” said Shelby Chestnut, director of community organizing and public advocacy at the New York City Anti-Violence Project. “But violence is still occurring against many marginalized communities, and the trans community is deeply affected by that. “We need to push the public to pay attention to trans issues and see it as a civil rights issue,” she continued. “We are in this moment in society where violence and hatred is emerging in a number of communities, and it exists in New York.” Nationally, Ms. Chestnut said, transgender women are being killed in greater numbers than any other segment of the L.G.B.T. community. This year alone, she said, there have been seven such murders: Six victims were African-American, and one was Native American. Advocates said these instances of violence were not isolated but the result of a combination of factors that leave African-American and Latina trans women vulnerable. Harassed in public, rejected by their families and uneasy in school or homeless shelters for men, they are left to fend for themselves and are at a higher risk of becoming victims of violence, advocates said. And the political debate over unauthorized immigrants has left many fearful of speaking out. “The biggest challenge in working with transgender people is they often don’t have the self-esteem to think they are worth seeking support or help for themselves,” said City Councilman Daniel Dromm, who represents Jackson Heights. “There is also distrust in going to the authorities, especially the police,” he said. “In the past they have gone there and faced harassment, even at night when they were coming home from the bars. That distrust causes hesitation.” Nayra and Gabriela encountered some of this after the attack. Although the police who responded were helpful, they said, the detectives who followed up with them at the hospital made them uncomfortable by asking the same questions repeatedly, as if they did not believe them. Nor did the detectives speak Spanish, even though the women, who are Puerto Rican, have limited English proficiency. Since that encounter in the hospital, the women said, they have yet to hear back from the police. “We need more laws to ensure the security of trans women,” said Bianey Garcia, a transgender organizer with Make the Road New York. “We don’t need more police. We want the police who are already there to pay more attention to these cases.” Until then, Gabriela and Nayra are paying extra attention. “We never had anything happen to us before,” Gabriela said. “Now I walk with fear, like any woman. But now I pay more attention to what I hear around me. I notice more. I look at every little thing. If a couple of people pass by too close to me on the street, I keep walking, wait a little and then look back at them quickly to see if anyone is following me.” ",New York Times,1
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/opinion/when-your-commute-includes-hearing-you-dont-belong-in-this-country.html,"This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of President Trump. Rajpreet Heir was taking the L train to a friend’s birthday party in Manhattan this month when a white man began shouting at her. “Do you even know what a Marine looks like?” the man asked Ms. Heir, who is pictured in the video above. “Do you know what they have to see? What they do for this country? Because of people like you.” He told Ms. Heir, who is Sikh and was born in Indiana, that he hoped she was sent “back to Lebanon” and said, “You don’t belong in this country.” As New York City works to respond to a rise in reports of discrimination and harassment, subways have emerged as a source of special concern. Harassment has long been a problem on subways, in part because many strangers are packed together on narrow cars, sometimes for long periods. “Even in a park, you’re not going to be quite that close together,” said Emily May, the executive director of the anti-harassment group Hollaback. But since the election, the group has received nearly double the usual number of reports of harassment on the subway, and more than usual involve racist, Islamophobic or anti-immigrant comments. The New York City Commission on Human Rights was concerned enough about postelection incidents on subways that it organized an outreach day in December, with handouts on religious discrimination and reporting harassment distributed at eight subway stations. Overall, the commission saw a 480 percent increase in claims of discriminatory harassment between 2015 and 2016. For Sarah Dodds-Brown, the shock of being singled out for a racist attack was compounded by the fact that no one stepped in to help her. She was riding the train to work one morning in mid-January when a man began elbowing her in the back. When Ms. Dodds-Brown, who is black, asked him to stop, he said, “Obama’s term is over.” Then the man, who was Asian-American, delivered an angry rant that included a comment about “self-righteous slaves.” “I wouldn’t have expected somebody to confront him, necessarily,” she said. But even someone making eye contact with the man, she said, would have sent the message that his behavior was unacceptable. Harassment can be more traumatic when no one steps in to help, Ms. May said, and people who have experienced it are more likely to wish a bystander had spoken up than that police had gotten involved. Two fellow passengers stepped in to help Ms. Heir after the incident on the L train. One woman tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she was all right. “That meant something,” Ms. Heir said, “because when you’re a minority, you’re so used to just experiencing things on your own.” Another woman reported the incident to a police officer at a subway station. Anyone who witnesses or experiences harassment on the subway can report it to the city’s human rights commission by calling (718) 722-3131. Communities Against Hate, a partnership of 11 civil rights organizations, operates a hotline at 844-9-NO-HATE (844-966-4283), where people who have been harassed can get information about resources like legal services and counseling. Hollaback and other organizations offer bystander intervention training to help people learn what to do if they see someone being harassed. Ms. Dodds-Brown reported what happened to her on the subway to the Documenting Hate project, a group of organizations — including The New York Times opinion section — tracking hate crimes and harassment since the election. She also posted about the incident on Facebook and talked to her children and their teachers about it. She wanted people to understand how to protect themselves and others, she said. “We actually all have a responsibility to create the society we want.” If you have experienced, witnessed or read about a hate crime or incident of bias or harassment, you can use this form to send information about the incident to This Week in Hate and other partners in the Documenting Hate project. The form is not a report to law enforcement or any government agency. These resources may be helpful for people who have experienced harassment.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/opinion/timothy-caughman-the-other-terror-victim.html,"His name was Timothy Caughman. He was from Manhattan and was 66 when he died. The police say he was stabbed on Monday night by a 28-year-old man who had come to New York City from Baltimore looking to kill black men. It was Mr. Caughman’s misfortune to be male and black when the stranger with a 26-inch sword approached on Ninth Avenue near 36th Street, around the corner from where he lived. We don’t know much else about Mr. Caughman, but the persona he shared with the world on Twitter was that of a man of buoyant outlook and varied interests, who was amused by many things, fond of music and movies, captivated by celebrities. His profile says he was a “can and bottle recycler” and collector of autographs. “I would love to visit California,” it says. A selfie shows him waiting in line to vote and declaring his love for America. His Twitter feed is generous with condolences for celebrities: for Chuck Berry, Joni Sledge, Al Jarreau. On St. Patrick’s Day he retweeted a photograph of the athletes of Team Ireland competing in the Special Olympics World Winter Games in Austria. Mr. Caughman’s death was, by the police account, a murderous act of terror in the heart of America’s biggest city, at a time of white-hot fear of radical violence. On Thursday, President Trump sent prayers and condolences via Twitter to the family and friends of Kurt Cochran, an American killed in a terrorist rampage in London. He called Mr. Cochran “a great American.” He did not tweet about his fellow New Yorker, Mr. Caughman. Mr. Trump is easily provoked to outrage. But he seems unable to summon that emotion on behalf of Mr. Caughman, who was poor and black and lived in a shelter for homeless people with H.I.V. and AIDS. Maybe he’s not that kind of president. So the next best thing is to turn to his predecessor Barack Obama, who confronted senseless violence with healing words again and again. In January he said this, to a Chicago TV news station: “We don’t benefit from pretending that racism doesn’t exist and hate doesn’t exist. We don’t benefit from not talking about it. The fact that these things are being surfaced means we can solve them. But over all, what I’ve seen as president in traveling around the country is, particularly, the next generation, young people, their appreciation of people who are different than them, come from different places, have different backgrounds, my daughter’s generation, they’re far more sophisticated about race, far more tolerant and embracing of diversity. So I think that over the long arc, America will keep on getting better.” Yet suspicion and hatred are stoked daily; intolerance is federal policy; white nationalists serve in the White House. Mr. Obama is right to believe in a tolerant America — but with crimes like these, keeping faith in that vision can be difficult over the long arc that seems to get longer every day.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/nyregion/james-harris-jackson-timothy-caughman-murder.html,"Draped in the clouds of his white spacesuit, James Harris Jackson, 28, trim light hair above a shaved, doughy face, was led in handcuffs out of a police station house in Midtown Manhattan on Thursday morning, then driven downtown for his arraignment. Prosecutors say Mr. Jackson traveled to New York from Baltimore with a single intention, that of killing black men — no one in particular, just blacks in general — and that he plunged an 18-inch blade into Timothy Caughman, 66, late on Monday evening. In December 2014, a little more than two years ago, another person crazed over color came to New York, also from Baltimore, and made his way to Brooklyn. That man, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, walked up to the passenger-side window of a police car parked in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and emptied a silver semiautomatic handgun, killing officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. A few minutes later, Mr. Brinsley turned his gun on himself as he was chased into a subway station. His fixation was neither black, white nor any other hues of human skin; it was blue. Same motive, different weaponry. Mr. Jackson, the authorities say, is a white supremacist obsessed with black men mixing with white women; Mr. Brinsley proclaimed himself an avenger of black lives cut down by police officers, and on social media declared his intention to kill some. The lawyer for Mr. Jackson has made the sensible point that the facts need to be established, and that if they were indeed as claimed, then mental health issues would have to be addressed. What followed the murder of the two police officers in 2014 bore no resemblance to such a measured response. With Mr. Brinsley’s suicide, public figures quickly looked for people to blame. The head of the police union said Mayor Bill de Blasio had “blood on his hands.” A former governor of New York also blamed the mayor, and added the United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. A former mayor blamed President Obama, even though the president had condemned the murders, called on the public to support the police, and solicited prayers for the officers’ families. Now comes the matter of a purported white supremacist who, prosecutors say, not only used a sword to slaughter an innocent man, but had plans to kill more in Times Square. The usual suspects on matters of terrorism have not been rushing to condemn this week’s murder of Mr. Caughman. President Trump has not yet said anything about this horrific crime. Figuring out which politicians are more virtuous based on the speed of their denunciations of heinous acts is a fool’s game; nothing is repaired by pious news releases or rants on cable television and social media. Still, the sharp sensitivity of the president to any crime charged to an immigrant is striking when compared with his seeming indifference to attacks on minorities, or his own verbal forays. He was notably slow off the mark when an Indian engineer was killed in Kansas by a man who questioned his immigration status. After David Duke, the former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, supported his candidacy, Mr. Trump said he did not know who Mr. Duke was, despite a long, unambiguous public record to the contrary. During the campaign, Mr. Trump re-tweeted false statistics from a white supremacist about black-on-white crime. He said Mexico was sending rapists and criminals to the United States, although studies show that immigrants, both with and without permission to be in the country, are more law-abiding than those born here. For the better part of five years, Mr. Trump claimed that President Obama was not born in America and that his investigators had evidence of it. He had none. It is beyond conception that any elected official in the United States, from Mr. Trump down, could choose to appear indifferent to race-based attacks. Much remains to be learned about the man accused of this week’s crime; the authorities say his race hatred goes back a decade. Surveillance video appears to show Mr. Caughman’s attacker scampering along a street in Midtown moments after the stabbing. However deep the roots of that violence, it is impossible to look at those images and not recall the proverbial warning, that they who sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind. ",New York Times,1
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/jcc-bomb-threats.html,"JERUSALEM — A monthslong wave of bomb threats against Jewish institutions in the United States that prompted evacuations, heightened security and fears of rising anti-Semitism gave way to an unexpected twist on Thursday. The person responsible for many of the threats, law enforcement officials said, was half a world away, in Israel, a Jewish teenager. An intensive investigation spanning multiple countries culminated on Thursday in the arrest of the 18-year-old suspect, who holds dual Israeli and American citizenship, and his father. The teenager’s lawyer said he had a brain tumor that could affect his behavior. The surge in threats over the past few months — well over 100 sent to Jewish community centers, schools and museums since the start of the year — coincided with an increase in hate crimes against a number of groups, from scrawled swastikas to homicides, feeding worries about a new era of bigotry. American and Israeli officials refused to say how many of those threats the suspect was accused of making. And some recent anti-Semitic acts were apparently committed by others, like threats against Jewish centers for which a Missouri man was charged, and the vandalizing of Jewish cemeteries. But officials made it clear that they considered the teenager, who lived in the Ashkelon area of southern Israel, to be the primary source of the threats, though they did not offer a motive. “This is the guy we are talking about,” an Israeli police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, said. The suspect made threats to sites in Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the United States, and to at least one commercial airline flight, prompting an emergency landing, Mr. Rosenfeld said. A judge ordered the suspect, who has not been charged, held until at least March 30 and ordered a medical examination. His father was ordered held for eight days, on suspicion that he might have been aware of the threats, or even been involved. The father denies any knowledge of the threats, his lawyer said. The judge imposed an order of silence forbidding the Israeli authorities to release either man’s name. The teenager, who was born in Israel, has a brain tumor that can affect his cognitive abilities and lead to “irrational” behavior, his lawyer, Galit Bash, said. She would not say whether her client, who she said did not have a criminal record, had admitted or denied involvement. Ms. Bash and the father’s lawyer, Eran Rau, who are both from the Office of the Israeli Public Defender, said the young man was an only child who lived with his parents and had been home-schooled, which is unusual in Israel. While most Israelis are drafted into military service, the teenager was rejected, which Ms. Bash said was because of his medical condition. Israeli news media reported that she had said in court that he had the tumor since he was 14. The father, an engineer in his early 50s, was cooperating with investigators, Mr. Rau said. He said his client, who also has no criminal record, was concerned primarily with his son’s welfare, given his medical condition. “This all seems very strange and preliminary to me,” Mr. Rau said. Israeli news outlets reported that when the teenager was arrested, he tried to grab an officer’s gun. In his brief court appearance, the suspect, wearing khaki cargo pants, bowed his head and pulled up his shirt to conceal his face. On Thursday morning, after months of investigation and waves of turmoil and panic, the Federal Bureau of Investigation held a conference call with leaders of Jewish organizations to discuss the surprising denouement to the investigation. As the news spread, it drew mixed reactions from Jewish leaders and anti-discrimination groups who tried to make sense of it. Joel Dinkin, the executive vice president of the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center of Houston, said that it was “a little bit perplexing from the standpoint of the fact that it’s somebody Jewish.” Jonathan A. Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, cautioned that many of the people responsible for anti-Semitic threats, vandalism and “a torrent of abuse online” remained at large. And even the threats attributed to the Israeli teenager, he said, should still be considered acts of anti-Semitism. “The motive may have been unclear, but the impact was crystal clear,” Mr. Greenblatt said. “These were acts that terrorized a community just because of their faith.” Critics of President Trump have accused him of playing down hatred and violence against minority groups and charged that his anti-immigrant remarks are fueling conflict. He did not publicly condemn the anti-Semitic threats and vandalism until Feb. 21, weeks after Jewish groups began calling on him to speak out. On Feb. 28, in a meeting with state attorneys general, Mr. Trump suggested that some of the threats and vandalism could be a politically motivated effort to “make people look bad,” rather than actual expressions of bias, according to people who took part in the meeting. Despite the arrest, “we hope our elected officials will directly confront the wave of hate violence that we’ve seen since the election,” said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Project. The authorities said the person who made the calls had sent them through the internet and used sophisticated software to disguise his location and camouflage his voice, which slowed the investigation. When the Israeli police searched the suspect’s house, investigators confiscated computers, an antenna and other equipment. An American official said it appeared that the man had used Tor, widely available anonymity software that masks a computer’s true whereabouts by routing its internet traffic through various points around the globe. Many people use Tor, which is managed by a nonprofit digital privacy group, including those conducting illicit business and activists trying to avoid government censorship or surveillance. “The investigation began in several countries at the same time, in which dozens of threatening calls were received at public places, events, synagogues and community buildings that caused panic and disrupted events and activities in various organizations,” the Israeli police said in a statement. The F.B.I. worked closely with the Israeli authorities on the investigation, starting in September — months before American organizations began to note a surge in threats to American targets, according to Cary Gleicher, the bureau’s top agent in Israel. Some of the earliest American targets of bomb threats were schools, centers and museums in Alaska, Florida and New York that were affiliated with Chabad-Lubavitch, an Orthodox Jewish movement, according to a Chabad official. The movement did not publicize the threats, which received little or no news coverage. Mr. Gleicher said he had met in early March in Washington with James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, who asked about efforts to find the person making the threatening calls, and made it clear that he had “great interest in getting this thing done.” In mid-March, Mr. Comey met with Jewish leaders at bureau headquarters to brief them on the investigation. “I left with a level of confidence that they were definitively making strides,” said Jerry B. Silverman, the chief executive of the Jewish Federations of North America. “It was clear that they were moving at a very rapid pace.” The American-Israeli cooperation intensified last week, when the F.B.I. sent 14 people — both agents and technical experts — to Israel to assist in the investigation, Mr. Gleicher said in an interview from Israel. “This was a big deal,” he said, adding that it had taken the resources of both countries to get “across the finish line.” “Monday was the eureka moment,” he said, when investigators figured out who was making the calls. In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who described the threats as “hate crimes,” said, “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate the targeting of any community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs.” ",New York Times,1
