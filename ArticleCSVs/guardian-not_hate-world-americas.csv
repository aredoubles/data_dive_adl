A Cuban military plane crashed into a hillside on Saturday morning in the western province of Artemisa, killing eight troops on board, the government said.

In a written statement, the ministry of the revolutionary armed forces said the Soviet-made, twin-engined turboprop Antonov AN-26 took off from the Playa Baracoa airport outside Havana at 6.38am and crashed into a hillside outside the town of Candelaria about 40 miles away.

“The eight military personnel on board, including the crew, died,” the statement published by state-run media said. “A commission … is investigating the causes of the accident.”

Officials did not immediately release any further information.

The majority of planes flown in Cuba were produced in the Soviet Union. Antonov produced the AN-26 planes in Kiev between 1969 and 1986.

The last major plane crash in Cuba was an Aero Caribbean flight that went down in flames in 2010, killing all 68 people aboard. That plane was a European-manufactured ATR-72-212.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/ja-rule-heartbroken-after-fyre-festival-descends-into-disaster,"Rapper says event, which has been likened to Lord of the Flies, was ‘not a scam’ as co-organiser admits he was ‘a little naive’

The organisers of a luxury music festival in the Bahamas have apologised after the event descended into chaos, drawing comparisons to The Hunger Games and The Lord of The Flies.

Fyre Festival, on the private Great Exumas island, had been billed as a “cultural moment” for monied millennials, with tickets costing up to $12,780 for a four-person package. It was heavily promoted on Instagram as an opportunity to mingle with models and “influencers”, including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski.

The event was due to feature performances from Blink-182, Skepta and Rae Sremmurd, and run over two weekends from 28 April. One of the organisers, rapper Ja Rule, reportedly toasted during a site visit: “To living like movie stars, partying like rock stars, and fucking like porn stars.”

But after headliners Blink-182 pulled out on Friday citing poor infrastructure, ticket holders arrived on Great Exumas island to chaotic scenes.

Posts to social media drew comparisons to a refugee camp, with “disaster relief tents” being used as cabanas in expanses of mud, mountains of rubbish, and low-quality sandwiches.

Patrons were left stranded on the island, with #fyrefestival trending on Twitter as they begged to be evacuated and others delighted in schadenfreude.

In a statement, organisers cited “circumstances out of our control” for their inability to prepare the “physical infrastructure” for the event in the largely undeveloped private island.



They were working to arrange charter flights to Miami for people already on Exumas while inbound flights had been cancelled.

The Bahamas ministry of tourism released a statement on Twitter, expressing disappointment that “hundreds of visitors to Exuma were met with total disorganisation and chaos”.

Though the ministry was not an official sponsor of Fyre Festival, it said it had offered advice and support to the organisers, who had assured them it was in hand. “But clearly they did not have the capacity to execute an event of this scale,” the ministry said.

A team of ministry representatives were on the island to assist with the safe return of all visitors.

Ja Rule wrote on Twitter that he was “heartbroken” by the way the event unfolded and that it was “NOT A SCAM”: “I don’t know how everything went so left but I’m working to make it right.”

A talent producer hired to work on the festival suggested that it was beset by problems from the outset.



“When we arrived, my initial reaction was ‘huh’,” wrote Chloe Gordon in New York Magazine. “This was not a model-filled private cay that was owned by Pablo Escobar. This was a development lot covered in gravel with a few tractors scattered around.”

“We were standing on an empty gravel pit and no one had any idea how we were going to build a festival village from scratch.”

Ja Rule’s partner, co-organiser Billy McFarland, told Rolling Stone that Friday was “the toughest day of my life”. He admitted being overly “ambitious”.

“We were a little naïve in thinking for the first time we could do this ourselves. Next year, we will definitely start earlier.”

There would be another event, held in the US in May, free for ticketholders that would “keep the theme of being on water and beach” and be “not just music, but all forms of entertainment”. He clarified that “we will not try to do it ourselves”.",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/29/mexican-journalist-apology-press-freedom-pedro-canche,"Pedro Canché has finally won an apology for being jailed after he criticized a state governor. But, he asked, what about the 104 journalists killed since 2006?

Pedro Canché, an indigenous journalist and activist in the southern Mexico state of Quintana Roo, had a hunch the local authorities were closing in on him for his coverage of angry protests over rising water rates in local Mayan communities.

So he filmed a video criticizing the intensely image-conscious state governor, Roberto Borge, and uploaded it to YouTube in August 2014. Just a few days later, police pulled Canché from his car and threw him in prison on charges that he had sabotaged a local waterworks.

The charges were eventually thrown out after nine months as a judge ruled no damage had been caused, and Canché had no relationship with the protest ringleaders.

The National Human Rights Commission later ordered the state government to publicly apologize to Canché and pay compensation, but Borge refused.

This week, a new state administration apologized to Canché – who took the opportunity to highlight Mexico’s ongoing crisis of press freedom, and the unpunished murders of scores of journalists.

“Who will ask for public apologies for the 104 journalists killed [since 2006]? Canché asked. “The Mexican state owes them and their family an enormous debt.”

Canché became a cause célèbre in Quintana Roo and across Mexico as yet another symbol of the country’s struggle for a free press.

His is one of the few positive stories: four journalists have been murdered in Mexico in 2017, including Miroslava Breach, who covered organized crime and drug cartels and was shot dead in March as she drove her son to school in the northern city of Chihuahua. Norte, the Ciudad Juárez newspaper she wrote for, decided to close after her murder, citing journalist safety.

Journalists in Quintana Roo – a state popular with tourists visiting Cancún and Playa del Carmen – complain that the harassment against them came from politicians, who control the press through agreements to provide newspapers with advertising, but allow the government to control their editorial line.



“In the case of Quintana Roo, media harassment always came from the government, not organized crime,” said Vicente Carrera, founder of Noticaribe, an online news organization in Quintana Roo.

Carrera speaks from experience. Noticaribe caught Borge lying about his whereabouts and not disclosing he travelled to the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley. Noticaribe was hit by denial-of-service attacks for the rest of Borge’s term in office, which ran from 2010 to 2016.

Luces del Siglo, a muckraking magazine in Cancún, had its covers “cloned” during Borge’s administration, with covers featuring negative headlines replaced with covers featuring positive headlines and spread online. Staff say stores selling the magazine had their liquor licenses threatened, leaving them few places to sell copies.



Sergio Caballero, Cancún correspondent with newsweekly Proceso, was hit by accusations of being involved with a drug dealer – charges quickly disproven.



How rich hippies and developers went to war over Instagram’s favourite beach Read more

“They invented crimes rather than killing you,” Caballero said of the situation in Quintana Roo, where corruption has grown rife as construction in a tourist mecca mushroomed.

“The Quintana Roo coast is a jackpot,” he said. “They tried to present their government as impeccable. Anyone questioning that was persecuted and attacked.”

Canché started a news website after his time in prison and started fighting for compensation; he had a business manufacturing deck beds and outdoor furniture for hotels in the state, which ceased operating while in prison.

His notoriety led to people slipping him information on scandals. He says it also prompted Borge’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to try striking a deal: the PRI’s 2016 gubernatorial candidate would publicly apologise and indemnify him so long as Canché publicly endorsed the PRI.

Canché declined.



“It’s complicated practicing journalism in a corrupt place,” he said. “They corrupt you and pay you off and eventually you stop pointing out their mistakes … This is what has allowed the government to be corrupt as it is.”

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/29/grounds-for-appeal-is-there-room-for-tim-hortons-on-uk-high-streets,"With an eye on a slice of the £3.4bn fast food market, Canada’s coffee chain enters the fray with London launch. Look out for the Timbits

The Tim Hortons coffee chain is so inextricably linked to Canadian national identity that the venue for its UK launch this week was obvious: Canada House, in central London. Never mind that the first British outlet will be in Glasgow – choosing the home of the Canadian high commission to mark its British debut reflects a certain national pride in the brand.

“Being associated with Canada at this particular moment in history is no bad thing,” says the company’s chief marketing officer, Neil Littler. “But,” he adds, “we won’t be sticking maple leaves on everything.”



While Hortons is an institution in its home country, this may well count for little in the UK, where the high street is dense with competition in the coffee, sandwich and doughnut markets. The chain at least has a signature product to mark it out from the opposition: the Timbit, a small globe of fried dough meant to represent the missing hole in a doughnut.

Hortons says, however, that it will focus more on fresh food. “Pret a Manger assembles its sandwiches on site, yes, but not in front of the customers,” explains Littler in a nod to one of its biggest UK rivals. Hortons says its expansion will be “nationwide” but is coy about details, aside from identifying its first British outlet. So the mass conversion to Timbits and a cup of Canadian filter will not be immediate, if at all.

But the potential prize is big. According to market research firm Mintel, the UK retail coffee market has raced from a value of £137m in 1997 to £3.4bn by 2016. The market has grown by £1bn alone since 2011.

However, wresting a meaningful share of that growth from established rivals will be difficult. Mark Brumby, analyst with leisure industry advisory firm Langton Capital, says the Canadian firm will not find the UK an easy market to crack.



“I was in Canada the year before last and [Tim Hortons] is an institution there, but I struggle to see what it’s going to add in the UK that we haven’t got already,” he says. “I can’t remember the last time I couldn’t find a coffee shop.”

He acknowledges that some players believe the market can expand. “Costa and the others insist there is room for more, they say we don’t drink as much coffee as the Scandinavians, and we don’t. But whether we ever will is the question.”

Hortons claims to pour eight out of 10 cups of coffee sold in Canada but it will not repeat that feat in the UK. “It’s competitive in the UK and we’re good at retail and leisure,” says Brumby. “Costs are high and it’s high profile but also high risk. If you don’t succeed, the world is going to see it.”

Founded in 1964 by former ice hockey player Tim Horton, who played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, the chain was originally conceived as a kind of diner for baked goods. Ten years later, Horton died in a car accident, and the chain that bore his name went on to win itself a kind of nostalgic respect, along with a dedicated customer base made up of everyone from students to builders to working professionals looking for a cheap lunch. For the last two decades or so, Tim Hortons has doubled down with advertising that ties the chain to another Canadian institution: ice hockey.

The Canadian high commissioner to the UK, Janice Charette, inadvertently plays to that image at the launch. “I’m a hockey mom, so for me that meant a lot of mornings in Ottawa piling my children into the minivan and then shivering in the rink with a cup of Tim Hortons.”



But that loyalty will not travel far across the Atlantic. Littler, the marketing head, makes much of the response on social media to the announcement, but admits it’s hard to tell how much of the excitement comes from Canadian expats.

Gurprit Dhaliwal, chief operation officer at Hortons, stresses that for now they will test the waters in Scotland, where many people have relatives in Canada, before eyeing a rollout to other British cities within a year – although London is not on the list for now. But how will the company sell itself? Will there be an advertising campaign? “When you find out, let me know!”

There is a twist to this all-Canadian tale. Tim Hortons is owned by Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (RBI), which is located in Canada but controlled by an ownership structure of Brazilian private equity group 3G and US investment firm Berkshire Hathaway. The Tim Hortons rollout in the UK has been outsourced to SK Group, a franchise operator that helped Domino’s Pizza get a foothold in Britain; Dhaliwal himself runs a Domino’s franchise company with his co-director of Tim Hortons UK & Ireland, Surinder Singh Kandola.

Charette admits that there’s something strange about the Canadian embassy hosting a launch event for a company with predominantly US ownership, but says the high commission’s role is not just to encourage Canadian business but Canadian employers, as well as to promote awareness of the country in Britain. “Tim Hortons means a lot to Canada,” she says.

Brazilian unions have ratcheted up the pressure on president Michel Temer with a nationwide general strike that closed schools, disrupted transport networks and led to clashes with public security in several cities.

Demonstrators in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo blocked key roads with barricades of burning tires on. Riot police used teargas and percussion grenades to try to disperse the crowds and open the routes.

Brazil's corruption inquiry list names all the power players – except the president Read more

Domestic media said it was the biggest general strike in decades, with protests reported in 26 states and strikes by teachers, bus drivers, healthcare providers, oil industry workers and public servants.

As night fell on Friday, there were multiple clashes in central Rio between protesters, who set fire to a bus, and riot police, who fired dozens of rounds of tear gas.

Cintia Manoel, a municipal employee, joined the crowd chanting “Fora Temer” (Temer out). Despite the friction, she felt it was necessary to participate. “I was there primarily against the government, which I consider illegitimate, and because of the workers’ rights and pension reform, which made this protest much bigger.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A demonstrator breaks the windshield of a truck in Rio de Janeiro. Photograph: Leo Correa/AP

Daniela Barbosa, an elementary school teacher, said the proposed changes to the pension system would oblige her to work for several years longer than she wanted.

The protest comes at a difficult time for the labour movement. Earlier this week, congress passed labour law reforms that weaken workers’ rights. The figurehead of the Workers party, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, is on trial, facing corruption charges.

His successor Rousseff said the strike was a symbol of courage. “This is a historic day,” she said. “In these difficult time, a fight for democracy and in defence of our social gains is the duty of all of us.”

Many voters are furious that politicians are insisting on the need for cuts in benefits and public services even as evidence grows that they benefited personally from illegal kickbacks on overinflated contracts.

Eight cabinet ministers have been implicated in the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation into corruption at the country’s two biggest companies, Petrobras and Odebrecht. Temer’s approval ratings have slipped into single digits, similar to the level of his predecessor, Rousseff, when she was impeached last year.

Government spokesman Alexandre Parola played down the significance of the industrial action. “A strike is a part of democracy. It’s acceptable as long as participants stay within the law. The country is still functioning,” he noted.

The shutdown was not total. In Rio, bus and metro companies ran a reduced service. Most shops and banks remained open. But students were told to remain at home and there were skirmishes between protesters and police at Santos Dumont airport and the main bus terminal. São Paulo was hit harder, with a shutdown of many bus lines and fierce clashes on the road to the Congonhas airport. More protests were expected later in the day.

“It is going to be the biggest strike in the history of Brazil,” said Paulo Pereira da Silva, the president of trade union group Força Sindical.

Nara Pavão, a professor in the political science department at the Federal University of Pernambuco, said it would be the biggest mobilization since 1996. He saw this as a sign of a crisis of representation as voters feel betrayed by politicians.

Flávia Biroli, a political science professor at the University of Brasília, said planned austerity cuts had stirred up public anger.

“The general strike shows that the organized sectors of society clearly understand that the proposals, if approved, will be the end of the fundamental guarantees provided for in Brazilian legislation, which will increase instability and poverty.”",guardian.com,False

It was billed as an Instagram-worthy luxury festival in the Bahamas – but the supposedly glamorous Fyre festival seems to be anything but.

Tickets for the festival, which was co-organised by the rapper Ja Rule, cost up to $12,780 for a luxury four-person package. Festivalgoers were promised “a cultural moment created from a blend of music, art and food”.

Ticketholders have called Fyre festival a “complete disaster”, saying the tents were half-built and the luxury food also failed to meet with their expectations. Now, some are stranded in the Bahamas.

On Instagram, the festival’s organisers wrote: “Things got off to an unexpected start at day one of Fyre festival.”

They added all inbound flights to the Exumas had been cancelled “due to circumstances beyond [their] control”.

The official Twitter account for the Bahamas released a statement addressing the controversy, saying: “We are extremely disappointed in the way the events unfolded yesterday with the Fyre Festival.”

Fyre festival was set up by Fyre Media, a startup run by Ja Rule and the US tech entrepreneur Billy McFarland.

In December, it was promoted by a slew of models on Instagram, showcasing what Fyre would have to offer. All the social media buzz from these “influencers” and Instagram models meant general admission tickets sold out before the music lineup was released.

The price of a ticket ranged from $450 for a day pass to $3,995 for “curated tented accommodation”. Some packages included chartered flights to the Exumas from Miami.

According to Vanity Fair, McFarland and Ja Rule paid more than 400 social media influencers to plug the festival, which is set to be held over the next two weekends. None of them have yet commented on the posts now coming from the festival site.

While it had a buzz on the web, according to reports earlier this month, organisation of the festival was not going so well. Page Six reported concerns that the organisers were “out of their league” as they had not yet seen pictures of the luxury villas promised on site.

Inspired by the Marvel comic superhero Iron Man, Browning flew in a circle and hovered a short distance from the ground using thrusters attached to his arms and back, captivating attendees at the Vancouver TED conference.

“The hypothesis was that the human mind and body, if properly augmented, could achieve some pretty cool stuff,” said Browning, an extreme athlete and engineer, at the gathering where he was representing his flight-suit startup company, Gravity.

The personal flight suit, called Daedalus, is capable of propelling wearers much higher and faster than demonstrated on the day, according to Browning. He said he had experimented with various numbers and arrays of the engines on his limbs, with some more successful than others. The current suit is capable of flying for around 10 minutes.

Haydée Gastelú was among the first to arrive. “We were absolutely terrified,” she recalls.

On the afternoon of 30 April 1977, 14 courageous women set aside fear – and their families’ warnings – and left their homes to confront the dictatorship that had stolen their children.

That day marked the first weekly march by the mothers of Argentina’s “disappeared” against the military commanders who had planned the systematic murder of thousands.

Blaming the victims: dictatorship denialism is on the rise in Argentina Read more

Four decades on and 2,037 marches later, the mothers are still marching, though some of them must now use wheelchairs.

The mothers’ white headscarves became a symbol of courage and the relentless battle for justice – and they have largely succeeded in their original aims: as of 2016, more than 1,000 of the dictatorship’s torturers and killers had been tried and 700 sentenced.

But the mothers – most of them now in their late 80s – warn that the current era of alternative facts and revisionist history poses a new kind of threat for the country.

“Argentina’s new government wants to erase the memory of those terrible years and is putting the brakes on the continuation of trials,” says Taty Almeida, 86, whose 20-year-old son, Alejandro, disappeared in 1975.

“This struggle began when we were in our 40s. Now, 40 years later, we have to start all over again.”

This struggle began when we were in our 40s. Now, 40 years later, we have to start all over again Taty Almeida

These days, the mothers are hailed as human rights champions around the world and feted by the likes of Pope Francis and the former United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon.

Forty years ago, however, they couldn’t even get their neighbours to hear their plight. The mainstream press was silent, and a large segment of the country sympathized with the dictatorship.

“People were scared,” recalls Gastelú, now 88. “If I talked about my kidnapped son at the hairdresser or supermarket they would run away. Even listening was dangerous.

“But I couldn’t keep quiet. We needed everyone to know, even if nobody believed us. That’s probably why they called us the Mad Mothers at first,” she says.

“Of course we were mad,” Almeida says. “Mad with grief, with impotence. They took a woman’s most precious gift, her child.”

At the time, the women couldn’t gather in groups of more than three or four if they wished to avoid arrest. Instead, they marched two by two, around the Plaza de Mayo in front of the presidential palace every Thursday at 3.30pm.

Like thousands of other young people who were forcibly “disappeared” during the dictatorship, Gastelú’s son Horacio – a biology student – was not actively involved in politics when he was seized by a group of armed men in August 1976 and disappeared without trace.

It took another 24 years before forensic anthropologists confirmed that he was one of 30 youths murdered by the army in revenge for the assassination of a general by leftwing guerrillas.

After staging a coup in 1976, the military rapidly put into action a plan to crush any potential opposition, eventually murdering some 30,000 people – almost all of them unarmed non-combatants.

But in recent months the historical consensus over the 1976-1983 dictatorship has been challenged under Argentina’s current centre-right president, Mauricio Macri.

His government suggests that the number of victims may have only been around 9,000, citing a provisional figure drawn up by a special commission after the return of democracy in 1983. But the military themselves reported killing 22,000 people in a 1978 communication to Chilean intelligence.

The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo – aware that their watch is drawing to a close – are deeply concerned by efforts to whitewash history – in Argentina and around the world.

“Among us there are mothers who escaped from the Nazi Holocaust, only to lose their Argentinian-born children to another dictatorship – so we know for a fact that these tragedies can repeat themselves,” Gastelú says.

There are mothers who escaped the Nazi Holocaust only to lose their Argentinian-born children to another dictatorship

“The Argentine military took lessons from the Nazis,” says Sara Rus, a 90-year-old Auschwitz survivor who settled in Argentina after the second world war – and whose son, Daniel, was killed by the military in 1977.

“I don’t even have his bones to bury,” says Rus, originally a Polish Jew from Lodz who still speaks Spanish with an accent.

And the mothers are painfully aware of the risk that can face those who speak out against tyranny. In December 1977, three of the group’s leaders – along with two French nuns and seven young helpers – were abducted in a series of coordinated raids. All 12 were drugged and loaded on to aircraft – then thrown unconscious but still alive into the freezing waters of the South Atlantic.

Robbed of their original leaders, the mothers fell under the sway of Hebe de Bonafini, an energetic and highly politicized woman who had lost two sons to the dictatorship and who prioritized political aims over the search for truth and justice. The mothers eventually split into two groups.

Bonafini’s group, while still active and important today, became embroiled in a corruption scandal during the government of former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner that discredited her cause in the eyes of many.

Despite the split, the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo can look back with some satisfaction at the work accomplished.

A sister group – the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo – grew up alongside the Mothers, and have also had success tracking down the children of women who were abducted by the dictatorship while pregnant.

The young women were murdered shortly after giving birth and their babies handed over to military couples to raise as their own.

On Tuesday the Grandmothers announced that DNA had confirmed the identity of another victim – the 40-year-old son of two desaparecidos – Enrique Bustamante and Iris Nélida García Soler – bringing the number of “recovered grandchildren” to 122.

In an age of epic corruption and political cynicism in Brazil, a new browser plug-in aims to attract and inform voters about the extent of their representatives’ involvement in graft.

Released before what is expected to be the biggest general strike in decades, Colour of Corruption is an online political scorecard that details criminal allegations against members of the cabinet, the upper and lower houses of parliament, state governors, their deputies – and even the president.

Stadium deals, corruption and bribery: the questions at the heart of Brazil’s Olympic and World Cup ‘miracle’ Read more

It comes in the midst of the biggest bribery investigation in Brazil’s history. Operação Lava Jato, or Operation Carwash, which started in 2014, has revealed a massive system of kickbacks and corruption involving almost all of the major political parties and dozens of leading companies, including the state oil giant Petrobras.

The latest revelations – detailed with shocking nonchalance by executives from the Odebrecht construction conglomerate – have prompted the supreme court to authorise investigations into eight ministers from President Michel Temer’s cabinet, as well as five former presidents.

Launched this week, the Google Chrome plug-in paints a vivid purple band over the name of any senior politician facing any kind of investigation. A click then reveals legal processes the politician is facing.

It is seen as a sign of a social and technological fightback against deep-rooted corruption and impunity, particularly when public resentment towards the government has been inflamed by controversial plans for pension reform.

Other sites and applications have targeted graft. During last year’s municipal elections, Brazil’s electoral court released an app for people to denounce electoral irregularities. But Colour of Corruption was launched by one of Brazil’s most popular consumer complaints sites Reclame Aqui, or Complain Here, which says 600,000 people check it every day.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The plug-in is seen as a fightback against deep-rooted corruption and impunity. Photograph: Colour of Corruption

Launched in 2001, Complain Here grew in importance during Brazil’s economic boom, when consumer spending soared but companies often failed to deliver what they had promised. Many Brazilians found posting a complaint on Complain Here more effective than contacting brands directly and also use it to check company reputations.

Now, with Brazil bogged down in the third year of a recession, consumers are turning their attention to democracy, said Iago Bolivar, director of operations for the Complain Here Institute, which is behind the launch.

“The country was very focused on consumption,” Bolivar said. “Brazilians are very focused now on citizenship.”

Information on legal cases is generally available, Bolivar said, but locating it in Brazil’s labyrinthine and cumbersome justice system to too complex for many. “We do not have a transparent justice system,” he said. “Even though this information is in a way available it is very difficult for the common citizen to access.”

After setting up an initial data bank with non-profit group Transparência Brasil (Brazil Transparency), the institute has partnered with the Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná State, in southern Brazil. Now 250 students from the university are upgrading the database with a team of lawyers and journalists, Bolivar said. The next step is to add thousands of mayors and state deputies.

Sylvio Costa, founder of Congress in Focus, a Brasília-based watchdog site, said the initiative will ratchet up the pressure on politicians already stressed by the overload of corruption allegations.

“They certainly won’t like it. But this is a war in which society has advanced more than the politicians,” Costa said. The problem will be keeping track of thousands of constantly-changing legally processes. “To do a system like this efficiently, you have to keep it permanently up to date,” he said.

The context is crucial. Last year, millions took to the streets to protest against the former Workers Party president Dilma Rousseff, who was subsequently impeached. Her replacement, Temer, has proven just as unpopular, with ratings now in single digits, and a third of his cabinet implicated in graft, or corruption.

This Friday, the country’s schools, hospitals and transport systems are expected to be paralysed by a general strike against social security reforms. While corruption is not the main rallying cry, it is a major reason for the public reluctance to accept the changes that politicians are trying to impose.

Standoff between indigenous protests and police in Brasilia – in pictures Read more

”If we cannot trust the government, why should we trust their message that this reform is unavoidable?” said Fernando Limongi, a Political Scientist at the University of São Paulo.

Whether greater knowledge of corruption will mobilise people has been debated. Nara Pavão, a professor in the political science department at the Federal University of Pernambuco, warned there was a danger that voters could feel the problems are so entrenched that they cannot be solved.

However, Pavão said the government’s unpopular efforts to reform the social security system – which is the major issue in this Friday’s strike – conveyed the impression that politicians were not just selfishly trying to enrich themselves, but had had a malign impact on the public.

“Corruption is not the motive of the strike but it plays a part. The feeling is that not only are the politicians corrupt, but now they are also actively working against them. It shows politicians are failing to consider the voters point of view.It is a problem of representation.”

Flávia Biroli, a professor at the University of Brasilia, said problems were particularly evident in the Temer administration because it was more detached from the public than any of its predecessors.

In a readout of calls between Trump, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday, the White House said: “President Trump agreed not to terminate Nafta at this time.”

Trump under fire over 'huge tax cut for the rich' Read more

However, the statement added “the leaders agreed to proceed swiftly, according to their required internal procedures, to enable the renegotiation of the Nafta deal to the benefit of all three countries”.



The news came after reports on Wednesday that Trump was planning to sign an executive order that would trigger the process for the United States to withdraw from the deal, which was negotiated by the George HW Bush and enacted by Bill Clinton in 1994. The US would have to give six months’ notice to withdraw from the free trade agreement and the executive order would start the clock in what the White House viewed as a negotiating tactic to force more favourable terms for renegotiation from Canada and Mexico. However, a White House official told the Guardian on Wednesday that the situation was “more complicated” than reported.

On Thursday Trump characterized the discussion with Pena Nieto and Trudeau as a request from the two leaders for him not to pull out of the trade pact. “I received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate,” the president wrote on Twitter. “I agreed ... subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA. Relationships are good - deal very possible!”

One of Trump’s key themes during his presidential campaign was his scepticism of free trade, in particular, the “bad deals” which he believed the United States had negotiated with other countries. Nafta had long come under particular scorn from Trump. In an interview last week with the Associated Press, Trump described the pact as “a catastrophic trade deal for the United States” and said “I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.”

Trump has had recent tensions with America’s neighbours. Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray slammed Trump’s plans for a border wall between the United States and Mexico as “a hostile act” on Tuesday and insisted yet again, contrary to Trump’s campaign promises, that Mexico would not pay for the wall. With Canada, Trump announced a new tariff on softwood lumber on Tuesday that triggered concerns of a potential trade war between the two countries. He warned that “people don’t realise Canada’s been very rough on the United States ... they’ve outsmarted our politicians for years”.

The initial reports that Trump was considering pulling out of the trade agreement brought a horrified reaction from a number of top Republicans.

John McCain tweeted that “Withdrawing from #NAFTA would be a disaster for #Arizona jobs & economy – @POTUS shouldn’t abandon this vital trade agreement”. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska issued a statement saying “scrapping Nafta would be a disastrously bad idea”.",guardian.com,False

Born at the turn of the past century, Maria Félix is old enough to remember the Mexican Revolution – but too old to get the bank card needed to collect her monthly 1,200 pesos ($63) welfare payment. Félix turns 117 in July, according to her birth certificate, which local authorities recognise as authentic. That would put her in the ranks of the world’s oldest living people.

She went three months without state support for poor elderly Mexicans after she was turned away from a branch of Citibanamex in the city of Guadalajara for being too old, said Miguel Castro, development secretary for the state of Jalisco. Welfare beneficiaries now need individual bank accounts because of new transparency rules, Castro said.

“They told me the limit was 110 years,” Félix said with a smile in the plant-filled courtyard of her small house in Guadalajara.

Félix, who sells candies from a stand outside her home, got by on her modest sales but was delighted when Castro became aware of her case, delivering a cheque and an apology to her in person. “Sooner or later, God provides,” said Felix, waving a hand. “Here I am.“

In an emailed statement, Citibanamex, a unit of Citigroup Inc, said Félix’s age exceeded the “calibration limits” of its system and it was working to get her the bank card as soon as possible. It said it was adjusting its systems to avoid a repeat of the situation.

Castro called the situation “absurd” and said his office would keep giving Félix cheques until the problem was resolved.

Félix, who has outlived six of her 10 children, has survived tougher times. She said her father was killed and her mother kidnapped when she was a young child and that her two siblings disappeared in the 1910-1920 Mexican Revolution. “I grew up like an animal on the street,” she said.



But she also looked back fondly on the past, frowning as she described the rudeness she said was rampant today. “Before you were poor but happy, in peace,” Felix said.

Félix credits her longevity to God, and says she enjoys a diet of stewed beans, nopal cactus, greens and the Mexican fruit pinguica - although she added that she had trouble digesting beans these days.

Alma Salas, head of the Jaliscan Institute for the Elderly, said Félix was in surprisingly good health and had refused a wheelchair she tried to give her last year, preferring a cane instead.

The world’s oldest living person is now 117-year-old Violet Brown of Jamaica, according to the Gerontology Research Group. Only 2% of claims by people who say they are over 115 are verified by a process that requires multiple documents, according to the group’s website.

Félix said she did not spend much time worrying about her welfare payments. “Whether they give me help or not, I’ll be as happy as I have been all of my poor life,” she said.

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/26/could-history-of-humans-in-north-america-be-rewritten-by-broken-mastodon-bones,"The history of the people of America, a story that dates back to the last ice age, has been upended by the battered bones of a mastodon found under a freeway construction site in California.

Archaeological sites in North America have led most researchers to believe that the continent was first reached by humans like us, Homo sapiens, about 15,000 years ago. But inspection of the broken mastodon bones, and large stones lying with them, point to a radical new date for the arrival of ancient humans. If the claim stands up, humans arrived in the New World 130,000 years ago.

Thomas Deméré, curator of palaeontology at the San Diego Natural History Museum which led the project, said: “Of course extraordinary claims like this require extraordinary evidence,” adding that the team believed “the site preserves such evidence”. Anticipating the disbelief of many experts in the field, Steven Holen, another project scientist at the Center for Paleolithic Research, said: “I know people will be sceptical about this.” That caution was summed up by one scientist who preferred not to be named: “They are going to face a shitstorm,” he said.

The partial remains of the American mastodon, a long gone relative of the modern elephant, were discovered in San Diego in the winter of 1992 during a freeway expansion project. When researchers moved in they found layers of fine sediments deposited by streams, bearing shells, rodent teeth, and wolf and horse bones. In one layer they found the mastodon, a beast that could reach a height of three metres and weighed eight tonnes when fully grown. The animals had roamed North America for millions of years.

The bones posed an immediate puzzle. The pattern of the fossilised limbs, the obvious damage, and stones found alongside them raised enough questions that the scientists brought in other experts and launched a detailed analysis of the remains and surrounding site.

The results of the investigation, reported in the journal Nature, build a case for the mastodon bones being “processed”, a term that translates into more frank terms such as smashed, cracked and snapped. Unlike the wolf and horse bones found in other layers at the site, the ends of some of the mastodon bones had been broken off, as if to extract nutritious bone marrow. Others had been battered. One of the animal’s tusks poked upright in the ground, perhaps by chance, or perhaps to serve as a marker for the remains.

Intriguingly, the bones were found in two rough piles, each with two or three large rocks measuring 10 to 30cm across. The scientists believe the stones are too heavy to have been carried there in the flow of a stream, and instead suspect they were carried by humans for use as hammerstones and anvils to break the bones apart. “What is truly remarkable about this site is that you can identify particular hammers that were smacked on particular anvils,” said Richard Fullagar, a stone tools expert on the team from the University of Wollongong in New South Wales. Pieces knocked off the stones and bones were found too.

“We have no evidence that this is a kill or butchery site, but we do have evidence that people were here, breaking up bones of the mastodon, removing some of the big, thick pieces of mastodon limb bones, probably to make tools, and perhaps extracting some of the marrow for food,” said Holen.

Most remarkable of all is the apparent age of the bones. Carbon dating and another procedure did not work in this case, so the scientists turned to a method that infers age from the radioactive decay of natural uranium which infiltrates the buried remains. The tests dated the bones to 130,700 years old, give or take 9,000 years. James Paces, a researcher at the US Geological Survey who performed the dating, said it was a “robust, defensible age” for the materials.

If the scientists are right and the bones were broken by humans while fresh – rather than by other animals, natural processes or bulldozers building roads – and the dating is sound, it raises major questions about the peopling of the Americas. Who were these pioneers? How did they get there? What happened to them? There is little to suggest that Homo sapiens had dispersed from Africa 130,000 years ago, but Homo erectus, the Neanderthals and the little-known Denisovans had reached Eurasia.

The usual assumption is that humans came to America from eastern Asia across the Bering strait. The crossing itself would have been easiest in the cold period that ended 130,000 years ago when sea levels were low and a land bridge formed. But could these early humans have survived the harsh conditions at that latitude? “It’d be bloody cold up there,” said John McNabb, a palaeolithic archaeologist at Southampton University.

Emboldened by claims that human ancestors reached Indonesian and Mediterranean islands by raft more than 100,000 years ago, the authors suggest that instead of walking to America, the humans, perhaps archaic Homo sapiens, arrived from east Asia on “watercraft” and followed south what is now the coastline of California.

It will take more evidence to convince many scientists, however. “This is a really extraordinary claim. There are questions about everything,” said Jean-Jacques Hublin at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. “Let’s imagine it happened. We have humans in America 130,000 years ago. What happened to them? They disappeared? When humans arrived in Australia, they were immediately very successful because they had no competitors. In the Americas, there is a huge range of environments where humans could be very successful. But to this date we have nothing in America until modern humans arrive.”

Another question lies with the dating. The uranium method works well on stalagmites and stalactites found in caves, because uranium around at the time is locked into their crystal structure. But it is far harder to date bone with uranium, because bone is porous, and uranium can seep in and out with water all the time. “I personally would never use uranium series dating of bones alone to assign age, it needs to be supported and consistent with other dating results,” said Dirk Hoffmann, an expert on uranium dating at Leipzig. “I am not saying the presented age range is wrong, but I am very cautious with this dating method on bones.”

David Meltzer, professor of prehistory at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, is even more wary of the claims. “Nature is mischievous and can break bones and modify stones in a myriad of ways,” he said. “It is not enough to demonstrate that they could have been broken by humans. One has to demonstrate that they could not have been broken by nature.”

To test their theory that humans smashed the bones with stones, the scientists smacked large rocks onto elephant bones and found that the violent impacts produced similar fracture patterns as seen on the mastodon bones.

“If you are going to push human antiquity in the New World back more than 100,000 years in one fell swoop, you’ll have to do so with a far better archaeological case than this one,” Meltzer added. “I’m not buying what’s being sold.”

Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said: “If the results stand up to further scrutiny, this does indeed change everything we thought we knew about the earliest human occupation of the Americas.” He added: “Many of us will want to see supporting evidence of this ancient occupation from other sites, before we abandon the conventional model of a first arrival by modern humans within the last 15,000 years.”",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/26/coach-swapped-liverpool-youth-team-sao-paulo-michael-beale,"Michael Beale looks relaxed as he surveys São Paulo’s players warming up at the peaceful Barra Funda training ground close to the city’s chaotic and congested Avenida Marginal Tietê. A little over three months ago he would have been watching a similar scene in rather different surroundings at Melwood. Now the Englishman is explaining why he left Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool for the Brazilian club.

“The two things that clinched it for me were visiting São Paulo’s facilities and speaking to Rogério Ceni,” he says, namechecking the manager. “Before I came I tried to explain to friends and to my boss at Liverpool that the size of Rogério at this club is like Ryan Giggs or Steven Gerrard back home. Ceni was paying me a huge compliment. When I visited the junior side set-up at Cotia it made me excited. The facilities are outstanding. It’s been very good for São Paulo. If you look at the squad now, 13 or 14 players have come from there. In England you have fantastic facilities. But Cotia is up with anything I have seen in Europe.”

In December last year the then under-23s coach told Liverpool he was turning his back on the Premier League to become assistant coach at São Paulo. This came as a big surprise because Beale had been making a name for himself. In the previous three years he had helped 18 players from the junior side get a crack at first-team football.

Klopp called the move “a bit of an adventure” but other colleagues at Anfield and at Beale’s former club Chelsea, thought it was an amazing opportunity.

Beale is working under Ceni, a São Paulo legend. The Brazilian’s stack of honours include a World Cup winner’s medal in 2002 as a squad member and he is football’s highest-scoring goalkeeper with a remarkable 131 goals.

After retiring from football in 2015, Ceni took a year’s sabbatical in Europe where he studied coaching. It was there he met Beale. Although Ceni had mooted the idea of a job, a concrete offer did not appear until late last year. Beale still needed persuading. The coach then had what he described as a “whirlwind nine days” when he travelled to São Paulo, went back home and made a decision within 48 hours to take the post.

The games in Brazil come thick and fast and Beale soon got a taste of things to come. “There’s a big disparity between the new and the old stadiums. A lot of English players and coaches would turn their noses up at some of the changing rooms and facilities I’ve seen. But then there’s Palmeiras’s Allianz Parque, which is wonderful. Our stadium, the Morumbi, has a unique feel to it. When it’s full it’s one of those things that you wish every coach or player could experience. It’s a bit like how I felt when I was lucky enough to work at Anfield – that had a special feeling”.

After four months in the job, São Paulo are still a work in progress. The 36-year-old Beale, Ceni, and the veteran coach Pintado, are trying to instil an attacking philosophy at the club. This is a slow process and while the goals have been going in, they could not save the Tricolor from narrowly going out of two tournaments in the past week.

Beale describes his experience as fantastic but says he often gets asked why a coach at Liverpool would want to come to Brazil. “There are many reasons. Just in the Florida Cup we played River Plate and two days later Corinthians. So straight away for an English coach those games are special. Going to Santos was brilliant. For us to win there for the first time in seven years was amazing.”

The obvious stumbling block is his Portuguese. Beale relies on the Frenchman Charles Hembert, who is the club’s first-team football supervisor. “I feel sorry for Charles,” he says with a laugh. “He’s trying to run his own life but now he’s also heavily involved in mine. Clearly I have some difficulties with the language. But football words are much easier. There are many ways to communicate with a player. You can demonstrate and you can move. Basically, once you know the verb it’s easy to communicate with actions and single words.”

The playing schedule is gruelling. Throw in the distances, the heat, the humidity, and kick-off times that vary from 4pm to 9.45pm and it is clearly no picnic working in Brazil. Beale argues that these factors, plus the dry pitches, affect tactics and the energy of the players, and says he is not surprised that most teams sit deep in defence and play possession or counterattacking football.

“Here in Brazil they have outstanding individuals. In a team in England, maybe three or four are technically very gifted, and there’s a mix of what you’d call ‘old-fashioned’ British players. But here every player has a trick and has the ability to play one v one.”

What has really impressed him are the fans. “The supporters are extremely passionate. The way they greet us at the Morumbi when we arrive. Thousands wait for us at the airport, then follow us to the hotel and stay outside singing. That just doesn’t happen in England.”

Off the pitch Beale and his family have been enjoying life in Brazil – a large house, a pool; the family was even offered a maid but turned that down. Although not blind to the country’s problems, he says people are more sociable and friendlier than back home. “I think no one rushes around. In England we’re too uptight with the schedule of the day. Here everyone wants to have a conversation. I’ve met fans from all the big clubs but everyone’s been very welcoming.”

Beale spent 10 years at Charlton playing alongside Scott Parker and Paul Konchesky. After becoming what he describes as a “failed footballer” he lost enthusiasm for the game but went into coaching at 21. He got his break at Chelsea working with their six-, seven- and eight-year-olds and that led to a full-time job.

Since then he has worked with coaches including Brendan Rodgers, Paul Clement and Steve Holland. “I was lucky at Liverpool. Academy director Alex Inglethorpe brought back a number of ex-players to work around the academy. So we had Rob Jones, Robbie Fowler, Steve McManaman, who’d come in on a regular basis. They didn’t coach but they were there to give advice. In the last few months Kenny Dalglish did that. He’d be at the academy three or four times a week and be a mentor to the staff. When I left we sat down for a couple of hours and he talked to me about my development as a coach. I really appreciated that. It was invaluable. When you think about having someone like Kenny you can call that’s a big plus.”

His experiences as a winger had a major impact on the philosophy of the nine coaching books he has written. “I’ve got a huge desire for individual development and fine-tuning players. I don’t believe in saying there’s no ‘I’ in team. There are 11 individuals in a side and I think it’s more about fuelling the individual than tactics.”

He has had calls from coaches wanting to know about working in Brazil and says he would recommend the experience “100%”. “I think more British coaches need to come outside and educate themselves. Football in England is unique. It’s only played like that in England. We have become good at coaching that. But it’s not a world game so we have to go out and learn.”

Beale admits he is on a steep learning curve in Brazil but he will have some time to reflect on his first four months when he travels to England to take his Pro-licence in May. This is all part of a long-term career plan that includes getting experience abroad, picking up a second language (third if you count his basic Spanish) and increasing his knowledge of football.

Despite the recent cup exits, Beale believes São Paulo are on the right track and he is confident he will see out his two-year contract. But he knows it could go pear-shaped quickly. Although he remains a realist, his positivity comes through in every conversation.

“I’ve been lucky at Chelsea, Liverpool and now São Paulo to have worked at big clubs with big players and I’d like to keep that trajectory going. Hopefully I’ll have the chance to be a manager and I’ll be a better blend from this experience. That’s the next step. It could be in the UK or abroad. It’s important to take different opportunities. The chance to come to Brazil was a one-off. I’m the only English coach here. I just had to take it. Of course I’m hungry. I’m not on the top of the mountain but that’s somewhere I’d like to be one day.”

https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/apr/26/tulum-mexico-hotel-evictions-instagram-favourite-beach,"Reviews of Uno Astrolodge, a boutique new age-style hotel on Mexico’s Caribbean coast, lean heavily on words such as “magic”, “paradise” and “peace”. When it opened in 2001, Uno Astrolodge was one of the first upscale hotels in the beach town of Tulum. Over the past decade, the once-sleepy town, 75 miles south of Cancún, has become the kind of spiritual oasis particularly favoured by the fashion industry and wealthy New Yorkers. Until recently, guests at Uno Astrolodge, set on an exclusive stretch of white sandy beach, paid up to $300 per night for a room in a candlelit bungalow with a view of the ocean. They showered under the trees in private outdoor bathrooms and ate fresh bread baked on site every morning. They could spend their time detoxing in Native American sweat lodge ceremonies or getting their Mayan astrology charts read. Wednesdays at the Astrolodge featured sound healing ceremonies; a “women’s circle” welcomed every full moon with ecstatic dancing.

But this other-worldly pampering was rudely interrupted on 17 June 2016. That morning Uno Astrolodge’s founder, Nuno Silva, a rangy Portuguese 45-year-old with a soft voice and long bronze dreadlocks, was at home with his wife and daughter. Just after sunrise, the hotel manager ran across the road to alert him to a problem. There were hundreds of men amassing in the street outside Silva’s beachfront property, the manager told him. Some of them were armed with machetes and big sticks. They were coming to seize the hotel.

Silva rushed across the street. He shut the hotel’s metal gates and listened to the group of men swarming over his neighbour’s property. It sounded, he recalled later, “like a medieval war” – shouting, stamping feet, a sense of fear in the air. Silva had an idea that this day would come. Tulum had been disturbed by evictions before, though hotel owners were careful to shield tourists from knowledge of the land disputes. But he was unnerved by the sudden violence of the scene outside his hotel.

Silva and his manager woke Astrolodge’s off-season guests and told them to gather their belongings and leave the premises immediately. The mob was moving nearer, working its way down just over a mile of coveted beachfront real estate, forcing people to vacate hotels, private homes and businesses, and padlocking the gates behind them. When one property owner refused the armed men entry, he was pepper-sprayed in the face.

There were about a dozen guests at Uno Astrolodge, and twice as many residents, masseuses and healers lived at the hotel, offering bodywork sessions and workshops in exchange for room and board. In its 16 years of existence, Astrolodge had developed into an odd fusion of commune and luxury hotel. It was not just Silva’s business, it was his home and the centre of his spiritual practice. He had met his wife, Katarina, at one of the Astrolodge’s African dance workshops in 2007, and they had raised their daughter, now seven, there. The couple had hoped that their twins – due within months – would be born there too. They were not going to leave the hotel without a fight. After the guests were ushered away, Silva parked a truck against the front gate to block the entrance to the property. Astrolodge’s anxious staff members gathered in a circle and began to sing the Hanuman Chalisa, a Hindu devotional hymn.

The raiders were accompanied by armed police officers, who were guarding a court official bearing eviction orders. Along with boutique hotels owned by foreigners, the properties being repossessed included Mexican-owned businesses, such as Dive Tulum, the resort’s longest-running cave diving tour operation, and the family homes of ordinary Mexicans, including Larisa Bolaños, who lived with her sister, brother-in-law and niece. Only one property on this stretch of land was left alone: Ahau, a luxury resort owned by Roberto Palazuelos, an actor with sharp cheekbones and slicked-back hair – known as the Black Diamond because of his dark tan and piercing blue eyes – famous for playing villains in Mexican telenovelas.

Silva’s makeshift barricade was no match for the mob, who quickly pushed through the gates. Silva argued with the court official: if this was an eviction, why had there been no warning? The man shook his head. The eviction notice had been signed by a judge. Silva, like his neighbours, was given two hours to vacate the property. Empty moving vans, rented to speed up the evictions, idled on the beach road. Dark clouds moved in and the wind picked up. A slow rain began to fall as Silva and Katarina began to move all their possessions – chairs and statues and cooking pots and photographs – into their small house across the street, which had not been repossessed.

Just before the two-hour deadline elapsed, Silva took the stairs to the top of a small watchtower, the highest point on the Astrolodge’s property. He looked out at the beach and offered up a brief prayer that he would one day set foot in his hotel again.

I had a sense of what Tulum looked like before I had ever been there, from glossy travel magazines and friends’ social media posts. The town’s distinct blend of high design, thatched-roof rusticity and beautiful seascapes looks great on Instagram; its upscale, neo-hippy aesthetic is right on-trend. Mayan temples nestling at the edge of the jungle add a spiritual element to holiday shots.

Budget visitors to Tulum can stay in the town proper, a busy little city of about 18,000 people. A two-mile road from the town to the beach passes a massive apartment development funded by real estate moguls, featuring a 40ft-tall “Pyramid of Positive Thinking”. Boutique hotels and beach clubs line the narrow beachfront strip, where the sand is white and fine. Walking along the road that divides the beach from the jungle, I had the option to purchase a $12 cocktail (bespoke, the menu reassured me), a $110 dreamcatcher, or a pair of $130 gold-sequined hotpants. I saw advertisements for vegan desserts, eco-chic cabins, “contemporary salads”, 10am yoga, a “sensorial holistic spa”, gluten-free cocktails and live gypsy jazz. Chalked signs issued vague commandments from self-help manuals: “Relax, Be yourself.” Even the drink menus elevated choosing a margarita flavour into an exercise in self-improvement: lemon for purpose; passionfruit for attunement; pineapple for liberation.

People don’t just vacation in Tulum – they embark on personal journeys. “There are still bragging rights to saying you were in Tulum,” Condé Nast Traveler’s lifestyle editor Rebecca Misner told me. “It’s an easy way to telegraph that you’re a certain type of sophisticated but laid-back person.” Tulum’s hotels and spas offer decadence with a sheen of spirituality, you can have your pick of ayahuasca ceremonies, Buddhist chanting and power yoga classes.

Tulum's distinct blend of high design, thatched-roof rusticity and beautiful seascapes looks great on Instagram

As self-righteous and spiritually scrambled as Tulum can sometimes seem, it’s also charming: its small shops and candlelit restaurants stand in marked contrast to the all-inclusive mega-resorts of Cancun, Playa del Carmen and much of the rest of the Yucatán peninsula. “My family does the Cancun deal,” Marshall Haas, a startup founder visiting from St Louis, told me. “But I like the small vibe of it here.”

Seventeen years ago, when Nuno Silva first visited Tulum, there were only about a dozen hotels facing the ocean. The road that led from the town proper to the beachfront strip was unpaved, and few tourists made the bumpy journey. Silva was 28. He had a law degree, an apartment in Porto and an inkling that something was missing in his life.

“I thought the best way I could live my dream was to buy some property in a tropical area with some potential,” he said. He tried Brazil first, but while it was beautiful, it lacked that certain something. In Mexico, at the turn of the millennium, Silva felt he was getting closer to what he was seeking. In Tulum, a place where visitors could clamber over 11th-century Mayan ruins and the low jungle gave way to pristine beaches, he realised that he had found it.

Nestled between an archaeological site on one side and a national park on the other, Tulum was uniquely insulated from development. Silva paid $300,000 for a patch of undeveloped jungle land. “Tulum was very, very remote back then, but I could tell it had some potential in terms of growth, in terms of trends. I could feel it would one day become one of those high-energy, mystical, alive places,” he said. “Playa del Carmen was already getting big. Tulum was just about to get discovered. I understood it was a good investment.”

At first, the property that became Uno Astrolodge consisted of a handful of cabanas on the beach, occupied more by Silva’s friends who came to crash than paying guests. But Silva’s instinct that Tulum was about to become a hot property soon proved correct. He told me that around 10 years ago, “in a normal, organic way, Tulum started to be more expensive, attracting more of a high-end market with higher standards”.

Silva built up Uno Astrolodge, constructing “primitive luxury” cabanas out of palm branches and wood panels, based on traditional models. In 2006, the beach road was paved, making the town much more accessible to wealthy tourists. That year, Michelle Perlman, a Manhattanite who claims to have coined the term “eco-chic”, opened a lavish boutique hotel offering rooms for upward of $400 a night. By January 2012, the New York Times was describing Tulum as “a destination so popular with the fashion crowd this time of year that it almost feels like fashion week”.

Articles about the town routinely mentioned celebrity sightings: Demi Moore sunbathing, Jared Leto partying, Cara Delevingne and Michelle Rodriguez making out in the ocean, Justin Bieber drunkenly mooning people at the Mayan ruins. This year, Copenhagen’s celebrated Noma restaurant opened a pop-up branch in Tulum, serving meals for $600 a head.

The town wasn’t necessarily prepared for the rapid influx of visitors. There were still no power lines to the beach. Instead, thrumming generators provided electricity for nearly 100 hotels that crowded along the seashore by early 2016. During high season, the narrow road between the ocean and the jungle became clogged with traffic. Neighbouring hotel owners got into screaming matches about noisy beachfront raves.

Silva had paid $60 per sq m for his land, a price that was considered high in 2000. By the time of the evictions, the going price was closer to $500 per sq m – an increase in excess of 800% in less than two decades. For all the talk of energy fields, it was clear that the real force powering Tulum was money.

When Silva purchased the property, he knew the ownership was unclear, but at the time, the issue didn’t seem particularly pressing. This stretch of coast was off the beaten track, and Tulum was underdeveloped. As the area became fashionable, however, the value of land rapidly increased, and as developers began to circle prime sites, the question of ownership became more urgent.

The dispute began with a government initiative to redistribute land to the needy, but it has turned into a land grab by the rich.

In 1973, the Mexican government designated 25,000 acres around Tulum as an ejido or collective farm, under a policy to provide land for impoverished peasants and encourage settlement in unpopulated areas. The Tulum land was divided among about 20 families who, over the years, have leased their plots (under the terms of collective ownership, they were not permitted to sell). Silva, like the other hotel proprietors along the beach, has a financial arrangement with the ejiditario or member of the land collective, who was allocated the land under the terms of the 1973 agreement. But a wealthy family from Monterrey, near the US border, believe that they have a prior claim.

The question of ownership erupted in 2002, when members of private security teams registered as guests in several beachfront hotels. The next morning, they used radios to call for backup, and evicted the owners and guests. These property confiscations troubled the neighbours, but did not necessarily shock them: everyone in Tulum knew that there was uncertainty about ownership of the land. Over the next 15 years, more than 30 hotel owners along the strip were evicted without warning, under threat of violence. The confiscated properties were then sold to the highest bidder and redeveloped under new names.

The shaky land rights and threat of evictions, ironically, became part of the reason the town had retained its charm – Tulum had escaped large-scale development because major hotel chains did not want problems with security.

Over the next decade, Tulum’s moonlight raves and yoga classes continued, as did the sporadic evictions. In 2014, a group of armed men seized four hotels; when bystanders attempted to film what was happening, the police confiscated their cameras. (They were later returned.)

Nuno Silva’s Uno Astrolodge was enjoying a busy high season in early 2016, when Silva was invited to meet with two men who wanted to make a deal. They were representatives of the Mexican entrepreneur Mauricio Schiavon, who claimed to be the rightful owner of the land on which Silva had built the Astrolodge. At that meeting, Silva told me, the representatives politely proposed that he buy his land from them for around $1.5m. They even offered to let him pay in instalments. No one made an explicit threat of eviction, but Silva suspected it lurked behind the offer.

Silva did not have that kind of money to hand, but the Astrolodge was so profitable at this point that he considered taking out a loan, or finding a business partner to fund the deal. But when he talked to his neighbours, many of whom had received similar visits, he was assured that Schiavon’s claim to the land was baseless. His lawyer agreed, and Silva refused to pay. Nothing more was heard about the offer until the dawn raid on 17 June.

No one who had been evicted from a property in the past 15 years had managed to return

Luis Parada, who was also evicted that day, lived in a small house facing the beach. He ran Casa Geminis, a small guesthouse adjacent to his home. Hours after the gates were locked behind him, he visited the courthouse in Playa del Carmen and tried to find out what had happened. Mexican law required a certain number of pre-eviction warnings, and he had not received a single one. “I went myself, with my papers and my employees and my lawyer. I told the judge, ‘Look, we bought this land 17 years ago, we have been living there, these are my employees. Can I see the file?’,” Parada told me. “He said ‘No, you cannot. Because you are not the one being sued.’”

It turned out that property owners had not received notice of their eviction because, curiously, the notices had been served against a dolphin trainer from Cancún. According to court filings, the dolphin trainer, a woman called Yibet Arsapelo, was renting the entire 1.8km stretch from Schiavon, and it was she who was being thrown off the beach.

The day after they were evicted from their properties, the dozen hotel owners were called to a meeting at Ahau, the resort owned by Roberto Palazuelos. Ahau was one of the very few hotels on the same strip of beach that had not been forcibly repossessed. Palazuelos, the telenovela star, had put himself forward as mediator. He has a fiery reputation, and is known around town for leaving furious voicemails for people he is feuding with – at least one of which has been remixed into a dance track. “He’s ambitious. He’s like Trump. He thinks his life is an action movie,” said Fernando Jiminez, whose beach club, now closed and locked, sits directly next to Ahau. Palazuelos is not well-liked in Tulum. A few years ago, he had to abandon his VIP seat at a boxing match because people in the crowd kept throwing things at his head.

At the meeting, Palazuelos served as go-between for the evicted hoteliers and Schiavon’s men. He explained that he had come to agree that Schiavon was the rightful owner of the land. He had paid the family and recommended that everyone else do the same. “I got tired of fighting … I want to sleep in peace,” he said at a later public forum about the evictions.

When Schiavon’s lawyer named his price – around $1,000 per sq m – the mood in the room became tense.

“My property was quite small. I paid less than $50,000 for it,” Parada told me. “And now I have to pay them more than $1m – when they didn’t develop it, they weren’t living in it? It was ridiculous.”

But the evicted hoteliers were in a tough position. Some of the owners of land that had been expropriated previously had counter-sued, but before their cases could be heard, their properties had been sold to other developers. The odds were very much against them – at this point, no one who had been evicted from a property in the past 15 years had managed to return. And though there were some high-profile hotels in this round of evictions, most of those affected ran relatively small operations and didn’t have the funds for a prolonged legal battle.

“A lot of people on this part of the beach didn’t have resources,” Jiminez told me. “Three of my neighbours just had houses — they weren’t, like, entrepreneurs. That made [the evictors] think, ‘Oh, they aren’t really going to do anything.’ These were hippies, people that were taking care of nature.”

The locked-out residents weren’t quite ready to give up. Later the same week, around 10 of them hosted their own meeting – without Palazuelos. They were determined to find a way to regain possession of their properties, even if their chances didn’t seem good.

Over endless cups of coffee at a dive shop in the centre of Tulum, they discussed strategies. Nuno Silva surprised his neighbours by revealing that not only was he a trained Mayan astrologer, he also had a law degree. The group consulted attorneys and pooled information at subsequent meetings. “We never really knew each other before. People were in their own worlds, you know?” said Silva. “[After the evictions] we started to get organised. We created a Tulum resistance.”

The hotel proprietors joined forces with the farmers, whose ownership of the land had been summarily dismissed, and the aggrieved parties presented a united force. A group of members of the collective, made up of mothers and daughters, flew to Mexico City to lobby their representatives. The group also realised they could use Tulum’s international reputation to call attention to their plight. The evicted hotel owners from abroad reached out to their home embassies. In July, the French, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch embassies all issued statements condemning the property seizures.

That same month, two Mexican journalists, Mariel Ibarra and Silber Meza, wrote a scathing account of how previous Tulum evictions relied on corrupt tribunals and apparent collusion by the state’s governor, Roberto Borge. Borge, who was voted out of office shortly after the evictions, is under investigation for the mismanagement of more than 300m Mexican pesos ($16m) during his term. He denies any wrongdoing.

In early August, Silva heard heavy construction equipment operating on the seized properties. It was impossible to see behind the tall bamboo walls that had been erected around the land, and he imagined he could hear the expropriated buildings being bulldozed. He and the other hotel owners worried that the demolition of their properties would make their cases harder to prove. “They don’t want to have the evidence that it is my house, so they tear down my house,” Larisa Bolaños told me. “Now there is no evidence.”

One member of the group suggested using a drone to film of the destruction. The footage showed the elegant stonework of Coqui Coqui, a hotel owned by a former Calvin Klein model, reduced to rubble. The group drummed up publicity by sending the video to local politicians and the media, and the demolition was halted. Luz María Beristain, state senator, picked up the group’s cause and gave a press conference saying that the sudden evictions “smelled bad”.

The campaigning group welcomed the publicity. But others in Tulum were not at all keen on the attention that the evictions were receiving. The town’s economy is largely driven by tourism, and a quote from one hotel owner saying she was “living in a climate of terror” did nothing to persuade people to visit. Nervous tourists cancelled their reservations and asked “is Tulum safe?” on online travel forums.

In November 2016, when I met with Adolfo Contreras Grosskelwing, president of the Tulum Hotel Association, and his son Richard Contreras, in the air-conditioned chill of the association’s office, both were at pains to stress that the evictions affected only about a dozen of Tulum’s 120-plus hotels. This left their organisation in the tricky position of trying to help the evicted hotel owners while continuing to promote Tulum as a tranquil and safe destination. “For the tourists [getting turned out] can be an inconvenience, it can be a frightening experience, it can leave them with a bad taste in their mouth,” said Contreras. “But it’s not dangerous. They are not in any way being targeted, they’re not in any way under threat. The threat is a purely legal one over property rights.” (The hotel association guarantees that it will find accommodation for any tourists who are caught up in an eviction.)

The association has also avoided taking an official stand about who the disputed land actually belongs to. “The farmers claim they own the land. The other party claims they do. There’s a possibility that neither is correct and it’s federal land that was never titled in the first place. It’s totally unclear, and there is no consensus,” said Contreras. That said, the association maintains that the proper way to sort out the ownership conflict would be through an above-board court case, not a series of surprise evictions.

“The things that are being presented as facts in this case are so utterly preposterous that no reasonable person who spent even the smallest amount of time looking into it would believe it to be true,” said Contreras.

In November 2016, five months after the evictions, at the start of high season, Nuno Silva drove slowly along the beach road, dodging tourists on bikes. After a few miles, we reached a part of the strip that felt more subdued. “This is all evictions,” Silva said. He looked out of the window, ticking off the properties as we drove by: “Thrown out, thrown out, thrown out, thrown out, thrown out.” The closed hotels were largely invisible behind bamboo walls: dead zones on this otherwise bustling road between the beach and the jungle. We drove by a property shielded by a tall wall; a guard sat out front, checking his phone, looking bored. A dark look crossed Silva’s face. “And this is what was Uno Astrolodge.”

According to Silva, there is some room for hope that this round of evictions might be the last. The new state governor, Carlos Joaquín González, who campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, has expressed his willingness to pursue criminal charges against some of those involved in the evictions. In November, a judge allowed five people – including Larisa Bolaños and Fernando Jiminez – to return to their properties while the court case over the land’s ownership was pending, a process that is likely to take years. Bolaños returned to find her family home had been demolished; Jiminez’s beach club had also been bulldozed. The Tulum Hotel Association is asking the governor to step in and push the courts to resolve the land dispute once and for all. Should this happen, there is one catch: with the question of land ownership finally settled, larger developers may decide that it is finally time for them to build in Tulum.

At one of Tulum’s elegant, outdoor restaurants, over a meal that managed to be both vegan and decadent, Silva’s wife Katarina tried to describe what made Uno Astrolodge such a remarkable place. She told me about the fresh-baked bread, the beachfront breakfasts, the time Sting came to her yoga class. “We haven’t looked back at it yet,” she said, gazing at her husband. “We haven’t been talking about how special it was. We just had to go forward.”

The evictions forced the couple to confront the rapid changes that had overtaken Tulum – changes that they, in part, had facilitated. “We were living in our golden bubble. It was happy, it was relaxed, it was mañana,” Katarina said. “Now we walk down the beach and see so many buildings and say, Tulum is getting so big! Before, we were protected.”

Silva told me that Uno Astrolodge has already been bought by the owner of a Cancún football team, even though that sale could be deemed illegitimate if the evictions are proved illegal in court. Silva recently met up with the property’s apparent new owner for lunch. “I asked him, you like my cabanas?” Silva said. The man politely told Silva he planned to bulldoze them and build timeshare apartments.

Both Katarina and Silva fought to maintain their optimism under the stressful circumstances. “Life is perfect,” Silva told me at the end of the evening, looking exhausted. “We have no doubt about it.”

After the violence, and the evictions, the threats of bulldozing, the legal wrangles, the heartbreak and bitterness, it was disconcerting to see Tulum’s remaining businesses doing everything they could to promote the town’s image of relaxation and wellbeing. But as much as I felt the need to resist Tulum’s spiritual indulgence, its insistent, self-satisfied aesthetic, I still felt myself succumbing to its beauty: the volcanic rocks speckled with snails, the train of puffy clouds lined up along the horizon. On my last day there, I went to the beach. The ocean smashed itself against the rocks with a furious, comforting consistency. Little white birds tottered by. I could see that, given the chance to buy a piece of this paradise at a discount, someone might view any future complications as a risk worth taking.

Later that evening, I spoke with Pablo Domínguez, a builder from Mexico City who first visited Tulum in 1996 and recently decided to move there permanently. He was a specialist in eco-friendly construction, and business was booming. Like nearly everyone else I met in Tulum, he was eager to talk about the fate of this beautiful, precarious, precious place.

“It’s like the world,” he said. “It’s paradise. But it’s fucked up.”

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/26/coach-swapped-liverpool-youth-team-sao-paulo-michael-beale,"Michael Beale looks relaxed as he surveys São Paulo’s players warming up at the peaceful Barra Funda training ground close to the city’s chaotic and congested Avenida Marginal Tietê. A little over three months ago he would have been watching a similar scene in rather different surroundings at Melwood. Now the Englishman is explaining why he left Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool for the Brazilian club.

“The two things that clinched it for me were visiting São Paulo’s facilities and speaking to Rogério Ceni,” he says, namechecking the manager. “Before I came I tried to explain to friends and to my boss at Liverpool that the size of Rogério at this club is like Ryan Giggs or Steven Gerrard back home. Ceni was paying me a huge compliment. When I visited the junior side set-up at Cotia it made me excited. The facilities are outstanding. It’s been very good for São Paulo. If you look at the squad now, 13 or 14 players have come from there. In England you have fantastic facilities. But Cotia is up with anything I have seen in Europe.”

Brazilian goalkeeper guilty of murder back in prison after brief return to football Read more

In December last year the then under-23s coach told Liverpool he was turning his back on the Premier League to become assistant coach at São Paulo. This came as a big surprise because Beale had been making a name for himself. In the previous three years he had helped 18 players from the junior side get a crack at first-team football.

Klopp called the move “a bit of an adventure” but other colleagues at Anfield and at Beale’s former club Chelsea, thought it was an amazing opportunity.

Beale is working under Ceni, a São Paulo legend. The Brazilian’s stack of honours include a World Cup winner’s medal in 2002 as a squad member and he is football’s highest-scoring goalkeeper with a remarkable 131 goals.

After retiring from football in 2015, Ceni took a year’s sabbatical in Europe where he studied coaching. It was there he met Beale. Although Ceni had mooted the idea of a job, a concrete offer did not appear until late last year. Beale still needed persuading. The coach then had what he described as a “whirlwind nine days” when he travelled to São Paulo, went back home and made a decision within 48 hours to take the post.

The games in Brazil come thick and fast and Beale soon got a taste of things to come. “There’s a big disparity between the new and the old stadiums. A lot of English players and coaches would turn their noses up at some of the changing rooms and facilities I’ve seen. But then there’s Palmeiras’s Allianz Parque, which is wonderful. Our stadium, the Morumbi, has a unique feel to it. When it’s full it’s one of those things that you wish every coach or player could experience. It’s a bit like how I felt when I was lucky enough to work at Anfield – that had a special feeling”.

After four months in the job, São Paulo are still a work in progress. The 36-year-old Beale, Ceni, and the veteran coach Pintado, are trying to instil an attacking philosophy at the club. This is a slow process and while the goals have been going in, they could not save the Tricolor from narrowly going out of two tournaments in the past week.

Beale describes his experience as fantastic but says he often gets asked why a coach at Liverpool would want to come to Brazil. “There are many reasons. Just in the Florida Cup we played River Plate and two days later Corinthians. So straight away for an English coach those games are special. Going to Santos was brilliant. For us to win there for the first time in seven years was amazing.”

The obvious stumbling block is his Portuguese. Beale relies on the Frenchman Charles Hembert, who is the club’s first-team football supervisor. “I feel sorry for Charles,” he says with a laugh. “He’s trying to run his own life but now he’s also heavily involved in mine. Clearly I have some difficulties with the language. But football words are much easier. There are many ways to communicate with a player. You can demonstrate and you can move. Basically, once you know the verb it’s easy to communicate with actions and single words.”

The playing schedule is gruelling. Throw in the distances, the heat, the humidity, and kick-off times that vary from 4pm to 9.45pm and it is clearly no picnic working in Brazil. Beale argues that these factors, plus the dry pitches, affect tactics and the energy of the players, and says he is not surprised that most teams sit deep in defence and play possession or counterattacking football.

“Here in Brazil they have outstanding individuals. In a team in England, maybe three or four are technically very gifted, and there’s a mix of what you’d call ‘old-fashioned’ British players. But here every player has a trick and has the ability to play one v one.”

What has really impressed him are the fans. “The supporters are extremely passionate. The way they greet us at the Morumbi when we arrive. Thousands wait for us at the airport, then follow us to the hotel and stay outside singing. That just doesn’t happen in England.”

Off the pitch Beale and his family have been enjoying life in Brazil – a large house, a pool; the family was even offered a maid but turned that down. Although not blind to the country’s problems, he says people are more sociable and friendlier than back home. “I think no one rushes around. In England we’re too uptight with the schedule of the day. Here everyone wants to have a conversation. I’ve met fans from all the big clubs but everyone’s been very welcoming.”

Beale spent 10 years at Charlton playing alongside Scott Parker and Paul Konchesky. After becoming what he describes as a “failed footballer” he lost enthusiasm for the game but went into coaching at 21. He got his break at Chelsea working with their six-, seven- and eight-year-olds and that led to a full-time job.

Since then he has worked with coaches including Brendan Rodgers, Paul Clement and Steve Holland. “I was lucky at Liverpool. Academy director Alex Inglethorpe brought back a number of ex-players to work around the academy. So we had Rob Jones, Robbie Fowler, Steve McManaman, who’d come in on a regular basis. They didn’t coach but they were there to give advice. In the last few months Kenny Dalglish did that. He’d be at the academy three or four times a week and be a mentor to the staff. When I left we sat down for a couple of hours and he talked to me about my development as a coach. I really appreciated that. It was invaluable. When you think about having someone like Kenny you can call that’s a big plus.”

His experiences as a winger had a major impact on the philosophy of the nine coaching books he has written. “I’ve got a huge desire for individual development and fine-tuning players. I don’t believe in saying there’s no ‘I’ in team. There are 11 individuals in a side and I think it’s more about fuelling the individual than tactics.”

He has had calls from coaches wanting to know about working in Brazil and says he would recommend the experience “100%”. “I think more British coaches need to come outside and educate themselves. Football in England is unique. It’s only played like that in England. We have become good at coaching that. But it’s not a world game so we have to go out and learn.”

Beale admits he is on a steep learning curve in Brazil but he will have some time to reflect on his first four months when he travels to England to take his Pro-licence in May. This is all part of a long-term career plan that includes getting experience abroad, picking up a second language (third if you count his basic Spanish) and increasing his knowledge of football.

Despite the recent cup exits, Beale believes São Paulo are on the right track and he is confident he will see out his two-year contract. But he knows it could go pear-shaped quickly. Although he remains a realist, his positivity comes through in every conversation.

“I’ve been lucky at Chelsea, Liverpool and now São Paulo to have worked at big clubs with big players and I’d like to keep that trajectory going. Hopefully I’ll have the chance to be a manager and I’ll be a better blend from this experience. That’s the next step. It could be in the UK or abroad. It’s important to take different opportunities. The chance to come to Brazil was a one-off. I’m the only English coach here. I just had to take it. Of course I’m hungry. I’m not on the top of the mountain but that’s somewhere I’d like to be one day.”

https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/apr/26/tulum-mexico-hotel-evictions-instagram-favourite-beach,"Reviews of Uno Astrolodge, a boutique new age-style hotel on Mexico’s Caribbean coast, lean heavily on words such as “magic”, “paradise” and “peace”. When it opened in 2001, Uno Astrolodge was one of the first upscale hotels in the beach town of Tulum. Over the past decade, the once-sleepy town, 75 miles south of Cancún, has become the kind of spiritual oasis particularly favoured by the fashion industry and wealthy New Yorkers. Until recently, guests at Uno Astrolodge, set on an exclusive stretch of white sandy beach, paid up to $300 per night for a room in a candlelit bungalow with a view of the ocean. They showered under the trees in private outdoor bathrooms and ate fresh bread baked on site every morning. They could spend their time detoxing in Native American sweat lodge ceremonies or getting their Mayan astrology charts read. Wednesdays at the Astrolodge featured sound healing ceremonies; a “women’s circle” welcomed every full moon with ecstatic dancing.

But this other-worldly pampering was rudely interrupted on 17 June 2016. That morning Uno Astrolodge’s founder, Nuno Silva, a rangy Portuguese 45-year-old with a soft voice and long bronze dreadlocks, was at home with his wife and daughter. Just after sunrise, the hotel manager ran across the road to alert him to a problem. There were hundreds of men amassing in the street outside Silva’s beachfront property, the manager told him. Some of them were armed with machetes and big sticks. They were coming to seize the hotel.

Silva rushed across the street. He shut the hotel’s metal gates and listened to the group of men swarming over his neighbour’s property. It sounded, he recalled later, “like a medieval war” – shouting, stamping feet, a sense of fear in the air. Silva had an idea that this day would come. Tulum had been disturbed by evictions before, though hotel owners were careful to shield tourists from knowledge of the land disputes. But he was unnerved by the sudden violence of the scene outside his hotel.

Silva and his manager woke Astrolodge’s off-season guests and told them to gather their belongings and leave the premises immediately. The mob was moving nearer, working its way down just over a mile of coveted beachfront real estate, forcing people to vacate hotels, private homes and businesses, and padlocking the gates behind them. When one property owner refused the armed men entry, he was pepper-sprayed in the face.

There were about a dozen guests at Uno Astrolodge, and twice as many residents, masseuses and healers lived at the hotel, offering bodywork sessions and workshops in exchange for room and board. In its 16 years of existence, Astrolodge had developed into an odd fusion of commune and luxury hotel. It was not just Silva’s business, it was his home and the centre of his spiritual practice. He had met his wife, Katarina, at one of the Astrolodge’s African dance workshops in 2007, and they had raised their daughter, now seven, there. The couple had hoped that their twins – due within months – would be born there too. They were not going to leave the hotel without a fight. After the guests were ushered away, Silva parked a truck against the front gate to block the entrance to the property. Astrolodge’s anxious staff members gathered in a circle and began to sing the Hanuman Chalisa, a Hindu devotional hymn.

The raiders were accompanied by armed police officers, who were guarding a court official bearing eviction orders. Along with boutique hotels owned by foreigners, the properties being repossessed included Mexican-owned businesses, such as Dive Tulum, the resort’s longest-running cave diving tour operation, and the family homes of ordinary Mexicans, including Larisa Bolaños, who lived with her sister, brother-in-law and niece. Only one property on this stretch of land was left alone: Ahau, a luxury resort owned by Roberto Palazuelos, an actor with sharp cheekbones and slicked-back hair – known as the Black Diamond because of his dark tan and piercing blue eyes – famous for playing villains in Mexican telenovelas.

Silva’s makeshift barricade was no match for the mob, who quickly pushed through the gates. Silva argued with the court official: if this was an eviction, why had there been no warning? The man shook his head. The eviction notice had been signed by a judge. Silva, like his neighbours, was given two hours to vacate the property. Empty moving vans, rented to speed up the evictions, idled on the beach road. Dark clouds moved in and the wind picked up. A slow rain began to fall as Silva and Katarina began to move all their possessions – chairs and statues and cooking pots and photographs – into their small house across the street, which had not been repossessed.

Just before the two-hour deadline elapsed, Silva took the stairs to the top of a small watchtower, the highest point on the Astrolodge’s property. He looked out at the beach and offered up a brief prayer that he would one day set foot in his hotel again.

I had a sense of what Tulum looked like before I had ever been there, from glossy travel magazines and friends’ social media posts. The town’s distinct blend of high design, thatched-roof rusticity and beautiful seascapes looks great on Instagram; its upscale, neo-hippy aesthetic is right on-trend. Mayan temples nestling at the edge of the jungle add a spiritual element to holiday shots.

Budget visitors to Tulum can stay in the town proper, a busy little city of about 18,000 people. A two-mile road from the town to the beach passes a massive apartment development funded by real estate moguls, featuring a 40ft-tall “Pyramid of Positive Thinking”. Boutique hotels and beach clubs line the narrow beachfront strip, where the sand is white and fine. Walking along the road that divides the beach from the jungle, I had the option to purchase a $12 cocktail (bespoke, the menu reassured me), a $110 dreamcatcher, or a pair of $130 gold-sequined hotpants. I saw advertisements for vegan desserts, eco-chic cabins, “contemporary salads”, 10am yoga, a “sensorial holistic spa”, gluten-free cocktails and live gypsy jazz. Chalked signs issued vague commandments from self-help manuals: “Relax, Be yourself.” Even the drink menus elevated choosing a margarita flavour into an exercise in self-improvement: lemon for purpose; passionfruit for attunement; pineapple for liberation.

People don’t just vacation in Tulum – they embark on personal journeys. “There are still bragging rights to saying you were in Tulum,” Condé Nast Traveler’s lifestyle editor Rebecca Misner told me. “It’s an easy way to telegraph that you’re a certain type of sophisticated but laid-back person.” Tulum’s hotels and spas offer decadence with a sheen of spirituality, you can have your pick of ayahuasca ceremonies, Buddhist chanting and power yoga classes.

Tulum's distinct blend of high design, thatched-roof rusticity and beautiful seascapes looks great on Instagram

As self-righteous and spiritually scrambled as Tulum can sometimes seem, it’s also charming: its small shops and candlelit restaurants stand in marked contrast to the all-inclusive mega-resorts of Cancun, Playa del Carmen and much of the rest of the Yucatán peninsula. “My family does the Cancun deal,” Marshall Haas, a startup founder visiting from St Louis, told me. “But I like the small vibe of it here.”

Seventeen years ago, when Nuno Silva first visited Tulum, there were only about a dozen hotels facing the ocean. The road that led from the town proper to the beachfront strip was unpaved, and few tourists made the bumpy journey. Silva was 28. He had a law degree, an apartment in Porto and an inkling that something was missing in his life.

“I thought the best way I could live my dream was to buy some property in a tropical area with some potential,” he said. He tried Brazil first, but while it was beautiful, it lacked that certain something. In Mexico, at the turn of the millennium, Silva felt he was getting closer to what he was seeking. In Tulum, a place where visitors could clamber over 11th-century Mayan ruins and the low jungle gave way to pristine beaches, he realised that he had found it.

Nestled between an archaeological site on one side and a national park on the other, Tulum was uniquely insulated from development. Silva paid $300,000 for a patch of undeveloped jungle land. “Tulum was very, very remote back then, but I could tell it had some potential in terms of growth, in terms of trends. I could feel it would one day become one of those high-energy, mystical, alive places,” he said. “Playa del Carmen was already getting big. Tulum was just about to get discovered. I understood it was a good investment.”

At first, the property that became Uno Astrolodge consisted of a handful of cabanas on the beach, occupied more by Silva’s friends who came to crash than paying guests. But Silva’s instinct that Tulum was about to become a hot property soon proved correct. He told me that around 10 years ago, “in a normal, organic way, Tulum started to be more expensive, attracting more of a high-end market with higher standards”.

Silva built up Uno Astrolodge, constructing “primitive luxury” cabanas out of palm branches and wood panels, based on traditional models. In 2006, the beach road was paved, making the town much more accessible to wealthy tourists. That year, Michelle Perlman, a Manhattanite who claims to have coined the term “eco-chic”, opened a lavish boutique hotel offering rooms for upward of $400 a night. By January 2012, the New York Times was describing Tulum as “a destination so popular with the fashion crowd this time of year that it almost feels like fashion week”.

Articles about the town routinely mentioned celebrity sightings: Demi Moore sunbathing, Jared Leto partying, Cara Delevingne and Michelle Rodriguez making out in the ocean, Justin Bieber drunkenly mooning people at the Mayan ruins. This year, Copenhagen’s celebrated Noma restaurant opened a pop-up branch in Tulum, serving meals for $600 a head.

The town wasn’t necessarily prepared for the rapid influx of visitors. There were still no power lines to the beach. Instead, thrumming generators provided electricity for nearly 100 hotels that crowded along the seashore by early 2016. During high season, the narrow road between the ocean and the jungle became clogged with traffic. Neighbouring hotel owners got into screaming matches about noisy beachfront raves.

Silva had paid $60 per sq m for his land, a price that was considered high in 2000. By the time of the evictions, the going price was closer to $500 per sq m – an increase in excess of 800% in less than two decades. For all the talk of energy fields, it was clear that the real force powering Tulum was money.

When Silva purchased the property, he knew the ownership was unclear, but at the time, the issue didn’t seem particularly pressing. This stretch of coast was off the beaten track, and Tulum was underdeveloped. As the area became fashionable, however, the value of land rapidly increased, and as developers began to circle prime sites, the question of ownership became more urgent.

The dispute began with a government initiative to redistribute land to the needy, but it has turned into a land grab by the rich.

In 1973, the Mexican government designated 25,000 acres around Tulum as an ejido or collective farm, under a policy to provide land for impoverished peasants and encourage settlement in unpopulated areas. The Tulum land was divided among about 20 families who, over the years, have leased their plots (under the terms of collective ownership, they were not permitted to sell). Silva, like the other hotel proprietors along the beach, has a financial arrangement with the ejiditario or member of the land collective, who was allocated the land under the terms of the 1973 agreement. But a wealthy family from Monterrey, near the US border, believe that they have a prior claim.

The question of ownership erupted in 2002, when members of private security teams registered as guests in several beachfront hotels. The next morning, they used radios to call for backup, and evicted the owners and guests. These property confiscations troubled the neighbours, but did not necessarily shock them: everyone in Tulum knew that there was uncertainty about ownership of the land. Over the next 15 years, more than 30 hotel owners along the strip were evicted without warning, under threat of violence. The confiscated properties were then sold to the highest bidder and redeveloped under new names.

The shaky land rights and threat of evictions, ironically, became part of the reason the town had retained its charm – Tulum had escaped large-scale development because major hotel chains did not want problems with security.

Over the next decade, Tulum’s moonlight raves and yoga classes continued, as did the sporadic evictions. In 2014, a group of armed men seized four hotels; when bystanders attempted to film what was happening, the police confiscated their cameras. (They were later returned.)

Nuno Silva’s Uno Astrolodge was enjoying a busy high season in early 2016, when Silva was invited to meet with two men who wanted to make a deal. They were representatives of the Mexican entrepreneur Mauricio Schiavon, who claimed to be the rightful owner of the land on which Silva had built the Astrolodge. At that meeting, Silva told me, the representatives politely proposed that he buy his land from them for around $1.5m. They even offered to let him pay in instalments. No one made an explicit threat of eviction, but Silva suspected it lurked behind the offer.

Silva did not have that kind of money to hand, but the Astrolodge was so profitable at this point that he considered taking out a loan, or finding a business partner to fund the deal. But when he talked to his neighbours, many of whom had received similar visits, he was assured that Schiavon’s claim to the land was baseless. His lawyer agreed, and Silva refused to pay. Nothing more was heard about the offer until the dawn raid on 17 June.

No one who had been evicted from a property in the past 15 years had managed to return

Luis Parada, who was also evicted that day, lived in a small house facing the beach. He ran Casa Geminis, a small guesthouse adjacent to his home. Hours after the gates were locked behind him, he visited the courthouse in Playa del Carmen and tried to find out what had happened. Mexican law required a certain number of pre-eviction warnings, and he had not received a single one. “I went myself, with my papers and my employees and my lawyer. I told the judge, ‘Look, we bought this land 17 years ago, we have been living there, these are my employees. Can I see the file?’,” Parada told me. “He said ‘No, you cannot. Because you are not the one being sued.’”

It turned out that property owners had not received notice of their eviction because, curiously, the notices had been served against a dolphin trainer from Cancún. According to court filings, the dolphin trainer, a woman called Yibet Arsapelo, was renting the entire 1.8km stretch from Schiavon, and it was she who was being thrown off the beach.

The day after they were evicted from their properties, the dozen hotel owners were called to a meeting at Ahau, the resort owned by Roberto Palazuelos. Ahau was one of the very few hotels on the same strip of beach that had not been forcibly repossessed. Palazuelos, the telenovela star, had put himself forward as mediator. He has a fiery reputation, and is known around town for leaving furious voicemails for people he is feuding with – at least one of which has been remixed into a dance track. “He’s ambitious. He’s like Trump. He thinks his life is an action movie,” said Fernando Jiminez, whose beach club, now closed and locked, sits directly next to Ahau. Palazuelos is not well-liked in Tulum. A few years ago, he had to abandon his VIP seat at a boxing match because people in the crowd kept throwing things at his head.

At the meeting, Palazuelos served as go-between for the evicted hoteliers and Schiavon’s men. He explained that he had come to agree that Schiavon was the rightful owner of the land. He had paid the family and recommended that everyone else do the same. “I got tired of fighting … I want to sleep in peace,” he said at a later public forum about the evictions.

When Schiavon’s lawyer named his price – around $1,000 per sq m – the mood in the room became tense.

“My property was quite small. I paid less than $50,000 for it,” Parada told me. “And now I have to pay them more than $1m – when they didn’t develop it, they weren’t living in it? It was ridiculous.”

But the evicted hoteliers were in a tough position. Some of the owners of land that had been expropriated previously had counter-sued, but before their cases could be heard, their properties had been sold to other developers. The odds were very much against them – at this point, no one who had been evicted from a property in the past 15 years had managed to return. And though there were some high-profile hotels in this round of evictions, most of those affected ran relatively small operations and didn’t have the funds for a prolonged legal battle.

“A lot of people on this part of the beach didn’t have resources,” Jiminez told me. “Three of my neighbours just had houses — they weren’t, like, entrepreneurs. That made [the evictors] think, ‘Oh, they aren’t really going to do anything.’ These were hippies, people that were taking care of nature.”

The locked-out residents weren’t quite ready to give up. Later the same week, around 10 of them hosted their own meeting – without Palazuelos. They were determined to find a way to regain possession of their properties, even if their chances didn’t seem good.

Over endless cups of coffee at a dive shop in the centre of Tulum, they discussed strategies. Nuno Silva surprised his neighbours by revealing that not only was he a trained Mayan astrologer, he also had a law degree. The group consulted attorneys and pooled information at subsequent meetings. “We never really knew each other before. People were in their own worlds, you know?” said Silva. “[After the evictions] we started to get organised. We created a Tulum resistance.”

The hotel proprietors joined forces with the farmers, whose ownership of the land had been summarily dismissed, and the aggrieved parties presented a united force. A group of members of the collective, made up of mothers and daughters, flew to Mexico City to lobby their representatives. The group also realised they could use Tulum’s international reputation to call attention to their plight. The evicted hotel owners from abroad reached out to their home embassies. In July, the French, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch embassies all issued statements condemning the property seizures.

That same month, two Mexican journalists, Mariel Ibarra and Silber Meza, wrote a scathing account of how previous Tulum evictions relied on corrupt tribunals and apparent collusion by the state’s governor, Roberto Borge. Borge, who was voted out of office shortly after the evictions, is under investigation for the mismanagement of more than 300m Mexican pesos ($16m) during his term. He denies any wrongdoing.

In early August, Silva heard heavy construction equipment operating on the seized properties. It was impossible to see behind the tall bamboo walls that had been erected around the land, and he imagined he could hear the expropriated buildings being bulldozed. He and the other hotel owners worried that the demolition of their properties would make their cases harder to prove. “They don’t want to have the evidence that it is my house, so they tear down my house,” Larisa Bolaños told me. “Now there is no evidence.”

One member of the group suggested using a drone to film of the destruction. The footage showed the elegant stonework of Coqui Coqui, a hotel owned by a former Calvin Klein model, reduced to rubble. The group drummed up publicity by sending the video to local politicians and the media, and the demolition was halted. Luz María Beristain, state senator, picked up the group’s cause and gave a press conference saying that the sudden evictions “smelled bad”.

The campaigning group welcomed the publicity. But others in Tulum were not at all keen on the attention that the evictions were receiving. The town’s economy is largely driven by tourism, and a quote from one hotel owner saying she was “living in a climate of terror” did nothing to persuade people to visit. Nervous tourists cancelled their reservations and asked “is Tulum safe?” on online travel forums.

In November 2016, when I met with Adolfo Contreras Grosskelwing, president of the Tulum Hotel Association, and his son Richard Contreras, in the air-conditioned chill of the association’s office, both were at pains to stress that the evictions affected only about a dozen of Tulum’s 120-plus hotels. This left their organisation in the tricky position of trying to help the evicted hotel owners while continuing to promote Tulum as a tranquil and safe destination. “For the tourists [getting turned out] can be an inconvenience, it can be a frightening experience, it can leave them with a bad taste in their mouth,” said Contreras. “But it’s not dangerous. They are not in any way being targeted, they’re not in any way under threat. The threat is a purely legal one over property rights.” (The hotel association guarantees that it will find accommodation for any tourists who are caught up in an eviction.)

The association has also avoided taking an official stand about who the disputed land actually belongs to. “The farmers claim they own the land. The other party claims they do. There’s a possibility that neither is correct and it’s federal land that was never titled in the first place. It’s totally unclear, and there is no consensus,” said Contreras. That said, the association maintains that the proper way to sort out the ownership conflict would be through an above-board court case, not a series of surprise evictions.

“The things that are being presented as facts in this case are so utterly preposterous that no reasonable person who spent even the smallest amount of time looking into it would believe it to be true,” said Contreras.

In November 2016, five months after the evictions, at the start of high season, Nuno Silva drove slowly along the beach road, dodging tourists on bikes. After a few miles, we reached a part of the strip that felt more subdued. “This is all evictions,” Silva said. He looked out of the window, ticking off the properties as we drove by: “Thrown out, thrown out, thrown out, thrown out, thrown out.” The closed hotels were largely invisible behind bamboo walls: dead zones on this otherwise bustling road between the beach and the jungle. We drove by a property shielded by a tall wall; a guard sat out front, checking his phone, looking bored. A dark look crossed Silva’s face. “And this is what was Uno Astrolodge.”

According to Silva, there is some room for hope that this round of evictions might be the last. The new state governor, Carlos Joaquín González, who campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, has expressed his willingness to pursue criminal charges against some of those involved in the evictions. In November, a judge allowed five people – including Larisa Bolaños and Fernando Jiminez – to return to their properties while the court case over the land’s ownership was pending, a process that is likely to take years. Bolaños returned to find her family home had been demolished; Jiminez’s beach club had also been bulldozed. The Tulum Hotel Association is asking the governor to step in and push the courts to resolve the land dispute once and for all. Should this happen, there is one catch: with the question of land ownership finally settled, larger developers may decide that it is finally time for them to build in Tulum.

At one of Tulum’s elegant, outdoor restaurants, over a meal that managed to be both vegan and decadent, Silva’s wife Katarina tried to describe what made Uno Astrolodge such a remarkable place. She told me about the fresh-baked bread, the beachfront breakfasts, the time Sting came to her yoga class. “We haven’t looked back at it yet,” she said, gazing at her husband. “We haven’t been talking about how special it was. We just had to go forward.”

The evictions forced the couple to confront the rapid changes that had overtaken Tulum – changes that they, in part, had facilitated. “We were living in our golden bubble. It was happy, it was relaxed, it was mañana,” Katarina said. “Now we walk down the beach and see so many buildings and say, Tulum is getting so big! Before, we were protected.”

Silva told me that Uno Astrolodge has already been bought by the owner of a Cancún football team, even though that sale could be deemed illegitimate if the evictions are proved illegal in court. Silva recently met up with the property’s apparent new owner for lunch. “I asked him, you like my cabanas?” Silva said. The man politely told Silva he planned to bulldoze them and build timeshare apartments.

Both Katarina and Silva fought to maintain their optimism under the stressful circumstances. “Life is perfect,” Silva told me at the end of the evening, looking exhausted. “We have no doubt about it.”

After the violence, and the evictions, the threats of bulldozing, the legal wrangles, the heartbreak and bitterness, it was disconcerting to see Tulum’s remaining businesses doing everything they could to promote the town’s image of relaxation and wellbeing. But as much as I felt the need to resist Tulum’s spiritual indulgence, its insistent, self-satisfied aesthetic, I still felt myself succumbing to its beauty: the volcanic rocks speckled with snails, the train of puffy clouds lined up along the horizon. On my last day there, I went to the beach. The ocean smashed itself against the rocks with a furious, comforting consistency. Little white birds tottered by. I could see that, given the chance to buy a piece of this paradise at a discount, someone might view any future complications as a risk worth taking.

Later that evening, I spoke with Pablo Domínguez, a builder from Mexico City who first visited Tulum in 1996 and recently decided to move there permanently. He was a specialist in eco-friendly construction, and business was booming. Like nearly everyone else I met in Tulum, he was eager to talk about the fate of this beautiful, precarious, precious place.

“It’s like the world,” he said. “It’s paradise. But it’s fucked up.”

Bruno Fernandes de Souza – who was an icon during his period as goalkeeper for Brazil’s most popular club Flamengo – handed himself in to police, ending two months of liberty that had generated fierce debate about the violence and misogyny of Latin America’s biggest country.



He has served less than a third of the 22-year sentence handed down by a lower court for ordering the 2010 killing of his former partner and the mother of his child, Eliza Samudio. But lawyers secured his release in February with a petition for habeas corpus because the country’s notoriously slow courts had failed for several years to rule on his appeal.

Bruno, still guilty of murder but bafflingly welcome to walk back into football Read more

To the fury of the victim’s family and many women’s groups, Bruno – as he is best known – then signed a two-year contract with a second division football club Boa Esporte in Minas Gerais state.



Protesters staged demonstrations outside the ground, saying the club was endorsing femicide and the very high levels of violence against women in Brazil. Hackers posted denunciations on the club website. Several sponsors dropped out.



But he also had many supporters in the crowd, who chanted “Somos todos Bruno” (“we are all Bruno”) despite testimony heard during the trial that their hero had conspired with his friends to kill Samudio and feed her to his dogs.

He played five games before the attorney general Rodrigo Janot successfully called for his release to be reversed because the defence’s legal team were partly to blame for the delays in his appeal.

Bruno turned himself in at a police station in Varginia, in the south of Minas Gerais. He is now being held in a detention centre in Santa Luiza.

Sônia Moura, mother of Eliza Samudio, said she glad to hear the news.

“I feel relieved because it was revolting the way he had come out of prison laughing,” she told local media.

The convict’s lawyer Lucio Adolfo told local media he would appeal. “Bruno is, like me, outraged and distressed,” he said. But he predicted the football contract would be rescinded.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/25/trump-border-wall-mexico-talks-tough-funding,"Foreign minister called plans ‘hostile’ and an ‘absolute waste of money’, as Trump appeared to back down on demand for funding from Congress

The Mexican foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, tore into the idea of building a border wall, calling it “unfriendly”, “a hostile act” and “unlikely to fulfill the objectives” of stopping the flow of migrants and illegal merchandise into the United States.

Appearing before the international relations commission in the lower house of congress, Videgaray unleashed uncharacteristically tough talk against Donald Trump’s demand that Mexico pay for building a border, telling lawmakers that Mexico would not put a peso towards the construction costs. He also called plans for fencing off the frontier “an absolute waste of money” and said Mexico would pursue legal measures if its borders were infringed upon by the wall.

“The wall is not part of any bilateral discussion nor should it be,” Videgaray said. “Under no scenario will we contribute economically to an action of this kind.”

US may avoid government shutdown as Trump softens demand for border wall Read more

The foreign minister’s comments come as the US president, who has insisted Mexico will pay for his campaign promise of building a border wall, pressures Congress to fund construction in the meantime. Trump had demanded Congress provide immediate funding for a border wall – even raising the possibility of a government shutdown – but appeared to be backing down on Tuesday.

Political analysts in Mexico saw Trump’s difficulties in persuading his own country’s Congress on key campaign promises – repealing and replacing Obamacare and finding funding for a border wall – as an opportunity for Mexican functionaries, who have preferred to not antagonize Trump, to take a tougher tone.

“Tough talk about the wall right now, right after Trump backing down, is low risk and comes without cost,” said Carlos Bravo Regidor, professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching of Economics in Mexico City. “[Trump’s] been all bark, no bite.”

Trump’s insistence on building a border wall has complicated Mexico-US relations, which had become close and cooperative on trade, commerce and security matters after decades of indifference and mutual distrust.

Mexico’s President Enrique Peña Nieto scrapped a trip to Washington in late January after Trump tweeted that his Mexican counterpart “should cancel” if a payment was not forthcoming. Both men subsequently spoke and agreed to not publicly discuss payment, though Trump used Twitter again to advocate building the border wall.

“The wall is going to get built and we’re setting record numbers in terms of stopping people from coming in and stopping drugs from coming in,” Trump said on Tuesday, referring to a sharp decline in the number of undocumented migrants detained at the southern border since he took office.

Roughly one-third of the nearly 2,000-mile Mexico-US border is already blocked by a barrier, something Trump wants to complete and insists will stem the flow of migrants and stop drugs from entering the United States.

Security analysts have questioned Trump’s assertion that the wall will stop illegal drugs since most illegal merchandise passes through legal ports of entry.

One member of Congress, Senator Ted Cruz, introduced the “EL CHAPO Act” – named for imprisoned Sinaloa cartel kingpin Joaquín Guzmán – on Tuesday, which would send any money forfeited by El Chapo or other drug bosses to build a border wall.

Guzmán, whose cartel smuggled tons of drugs through tunnels under the border and once escaped from prison via a tunnel from his cell, was extradited on the eve of Trump’s 20 January inauguration and prosecutors are seeking the criminal forfeiture of $14bn in illicit proceeds.

Some in Mexico expressed skepticism with the prospect of “El Chapo” indirectly paying for a border barrier as the size of his fortune is pure speculation and presents the problem of “how to seize it” for the authorities, said Esteban Illades, a magazine editor in Mexico City.

There is also the irony, he said, of “funding the wall with a law named after a man who can tunnel through anything”.",guardian.com,False

More than two-thirds of people living in Mexico, Chile and Ecuador are overweight or obese, costing their economies tens of billions of dollars every year, driving rates of disease and straining health services, according to a new UN report.

While the number of hungry people in Latin America and the Caribbean has halved in the past 25 years, the region is now struggling to combat an obesity epidemic.

How one of the most obese countries on earth took on the soda giants Read more

Changing diets, including more processed food that are high in salt, sugar and fat, along with more sedentary lifestyles have triggered a rising tide of obesity, experts say.

“The implications for the future of countries are frightening ... undernutrition is declining, but overnutrition is expected to become the largest social and economic burden in the region,” the UN World Food Programme (WFP) said in a statement.

The report by the WFP and the UN’s Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), said over the next six decades people being overweight and obese would cost Mexico an estimated $13bn a year, Ecuador $3bn and Chile $1bn.

Undernutrition, when people do not get enough food, and obesity – itself a form of malnutrition – are two sides of the same coin, and together they inflict a so-called “double burden” of disease on people and economies, the report said.

Undernutrition impairs child growth and brain development, while obesity can led to type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease.

“We now witness a worrying trend among vulnerable communities with cases of undernourishment and overweight simultaneously within the same families,” said Miguel Barreto, WFP’s regional director said in a statement.

“Both undernourishment and overweight represent a serious burden for the health of those families, that eventually translates into losses in productivity, and in pressure on the health and education systems in the country where they live.”

According to the World Health Organisation, obesity is an epidemic worldwide, killing 2.8 million adults every year, and obesity-related conditions now cause more deaths than hunger.

In Latin America, obesity is increasingly affecting the region’s poor, particularly women.

In Mexico, a country that faces one of the world’s most acute obesity crisis, 74% of women are obese or overweight compared with 70% of men, the report said.

The report urged food companies to play a greater role in combating obesity.

“The food industry has the opportunity to ensure the production, availability and accessibility of healthier food products,” it said.

Governments should also do more to promote exercise and health eating and place greater controls on food labelling.

The report noted Chile’s efforts to combat obesity, including an 18% tax on sugary drinks introduced in 2014 – one of the world’s highest – along with laws that restrict the advertising of unhealthy foods targeting children.

In 2014, Mexico also introduced a 10% tax on fizzy drinks, and 2016 research by the British Medical Journal found that the sugar tax led to as much as a 12% reduction in sales during the first year it was implemented.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/25/the-guardian-view-on-venezuela-a-country-in-pain,"Venezuela’s president Nicolás Maduro has failed his country. Picked by Hugo Chávez as successor just before his death in 2013, President Maduro has been an incompetent leader in hard times. He has failed to address the economic crisis triggered when the fall in the price of oil exposed the weaknesses of Chavismo, his predecessor’s ambitious experiment in poverty alleviation and social ownership. Now, in what was once South America’s richest country, more than four households in five are in poverty, twice the level of when he came to power. Babies and children die for lack of access to commonplace medicines. Murder and kidnapping for ransom are rife. Inflation is running above 800%; the economy is contracting sharply. Democracy itself is being eroded as the president defends his faltering grip on power. Weeks of protests have been met by state violence, semi-official vigilantes and, increasingly, counterattack from some opposition groupings. There is a wretched stalemate; and there is a real fear that violence could soon escalate out of control.

Like many of its neighbours, Venezuela’s democrats have to overcome a troubled history of rule by elites with little concern for lifting people out of poverty or shared economic growth. For more than a decade, Chávez seemed to offer a better prospectus: decent housing, proper wages and a fairer future. But after his premature death, the fall in oil prices laid bare the old divisions. His detractors point to a mixture of corruption and his failure to set up a Norwegian-style wealth fund to invest some of an oil income that approached $1tn as causes of the crisis. His defenders accuse the old ruling elite and its supporters of sabotaging the revolution.

But in the past few days, there is a sense that a bridge has been crossed. For the first time, demonstrators have included people from the poorer parts of Caracas, the people who were at the heart of the Chavismo project. Mr Maduro is talking about resuming talks with the opposition, brokered by the Vatican. But there is deep cynicism about these overtures. The opposition suspect him of playing for time, and remember bitterly that the last time they placed their trust in the Vatican’s involvement the talks soon foundered on the president’s obduracy.

Venezuela is in great danger. This stand-off can only be resolved if both sides make some big and difficult decisions. The opposition must accept that protests on their own will not force the Maduro government from office, and that increasing violence on their side risks appearing to justify the use of force by the government. Instead, it must, in the words of one close observer, find a better way of increasing its leverage. That means uniting around concrete objectives such as a timetable for local and governorial elections. It means uniting behind a single leader, a putative presidential candidate that all factions trust – a tall order when one pre-eminent leader, Leopoldo López, is in prison and another, Henrique Capriles, has been banned. They must acknowledge that Chavismo still has a real hold on the hearts of many Venezuelans and any future settlement must make space for it; it cannot be the kind of exercise in revenge that has been seen too often in other South American countries.

Conspicuous respect for constitutionality for the opposition. On the other side, a genuine commitment to negotiation. Bringing the president and his allies to talk may take personal sanctions. Those would have to be imposed by a multilateral group of nations. Any direct action by the US alone plays straight into the Maduro narrative of American intervention. The international community could make the presidential elections due at the end of next year the target for settlement, and international pariah status the penalty for failing to reach it. These are immensely challenging ambitions; there are not even obvious trusted mediators. But the alternative is a dysfunctional country that brings nothing but insecurity and suffering to its citizens. And that never ends well.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/25/justin-trudeau-brother-marijuana-charge-dismissed-canada,"Days after his government confirmed that its plans to legalise marijuana will not include a blanket pardon for those with past pot convictions, Justin Trudeau has admitted that his late brother was once charged with marijuana possession – and that their father’s resources and connections helped make the charge “go away”.

The Canadian prime minister’s comments, made at a town hall meeting hosted by Vice Media, came in response to a young Canadian who said he had been charged with pot possession.

Trudeau’s Liberal government tabled legislation earlier this month to fully legalise marijuana by mid-2018, putting Canada on course to become the first country in the G7 to do so.

But the legislation has since been criticised by some over its failure to include an amnesty for those with pot-related convictions – despite the government’s acknowledgment that those with criminal records often have trouble finding work, housing or travelling outside the country.



Speaking on Monday, Trudeau detailed how his brother Michel – six months before he died in an avalanche in British Columbia – had in 1998 been involved in a car accident.

Police found a few joints in the wreckage and charged Michel with possession of marijuana. But their father – the former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau – assured him it would be OK. “He reached out to his friends in the legal community, got the best possible lawyer and was very confident that he was going to be able to make those charges go away,” Trudeau told the audience.

He continued: “We were able to do that because we had resources, my dad had a couple of connections, and we were confident that my little brother wasn’t going to be saddled with a criminal record for life.”

His comments come as his government is facing growing pressure to couple legalisation with a blanket pardon for those with criminal records for marijuana possession. Earlier this month, the CD Howe Institute, a Toronto-based thinktank, urged the government to consider pardons as a means of sparking economic activity – as doing so would allow some Canadians to better access job opportunities – while also freeing up government resources.

Others, such as the progressive New Democratic party, are calling on the government to immediately decriminalise the personal use of marijuana, describing the charges as a waste of resources that saddles people with criminal records for something the government no longer believes is a crime.

In 2015 – the last year for which figures are available – 49,577 Canadians were charged with possession of cannabis, according to Statistics Canada.

Bill Blair, the former Toronto police chief tapped to lead the government’s efforts towards legalisation, has suggested that the charges tend to disproportionately affect minority groups.

“One of the great injustices in this country is the disparity and the disproportionality of the enforcement of these laws and the impact it has had on minority communities, Aboriginal communities and those in our most vulnerable neighbourhoods,” Blair said last year.

As he shared his brother’s experience of being charged, Trudeau said the story highlighted how the current approach fails to treat all Canadians equally. “People from minority communities, marginalised communities, without economic resources, are not going to have that kind of option to go through and clear their name in the justice system,” he said. “That’s one of the fundamental unfairnesses of this current system is that it affects different communities in a different way.”

In 2013, Trudeau said in an interview that he had smoked marijuana five or six times in his life. The last time he had done so, he told the Huffington Post, was about two years after he was elected as an MP.

Still, his government has continually stressed that the current laws remain in effect until the laws around legalisation are changed. Police forces across the country have underscored the point several times in recent months, carrying out high-profile raids on marijuana dispensaries and arresting dozens of people.

On Monday, Trudeau suggested his government would address the issue of criminal charges once legalisation is approved. “Our focus is on making sure we’re changing the legislation to fix what’s broken about a system that is hurting Canadians,” he said. “And then we’ll take steps to look at what we can do for those people who have criminal records for something that would no longer be criminal.”",guardian.com,False

Brazilian gangsters have taken armed robbery to a lethal new level with a cross-border attack on a Paraguayan security vault and police headquarters using automatic rifles, dynamite and anti-aircraft guns in what local media have described as “the heist of the century”.



One police officer was murdered in the assault and three suspects were killed by police after they fled the scene and crossed the river border in speedboats with an estimated $8m.

Using diversion strategies and a degree of firepower usually reserved for wars, around 50 gangsters – believed to be from the First Capital Command (better known by its Portuguese acronym PCC) – turned the city of Ciudad del Este into a battle zone for more than three hours early on Monday morning.

Soon after midnight, they torched vehicles to block access roads into the police headquarters, which they then raked with gunfire and bombarded with grenades and molotov cocktails filled with bullets to give the impression of a larger attacking force.



But the attack on the police was only a diversion: soon after it was launched, another, larger group of gunmen assaulted the headquarters of a private security company, Prosegur.

They killed a policeman, who was reportedly asleep in his car, then choked the main road outside the building with burning cars and shot at any vehicle that approached. Anti-aircraft guns were deployed in case the police tried to approach the area by helicopter, though that did not happen.

Using explosives, the thieves blasted the main concrete wall housing access to the vault. It is unclear how many they were able to break into, but they reportedly stole $8m of the $49m held inside. Closed-circuit cameras show the heavily armed assailants wearing ski masks and speaking Portuguese.

A battle then ensued with police who had been called to the scene. But the gangsters – who had infrared sights and automatic weapons – were more heavily armed. The officers only had their regulation handguns because the arsenal at headquarters was blocked.

Local residents recorded the sounds and flashes of the confrontation on cellphones. For more than two hours, the streets echoed with gunfire and explosions. At least three bystanders and one policeman were injured.

“The security firm’s premises have been destroyed in an attack caused chaos and terror in the city,” Justo Zacarias, the governor of surrounding Alto Parana state, told reporters.

The thieves split into three groups and drove off in security vans, lobbing explosives and spikes behind them to prevent anyone from following. Police later found an abandoned van containing heavy weapons, traces of blood and bulletproof vests.

They are thought to have crossed the Parana river in speedboats.

Brazilian police intercepted one group 50km (31 miles) on the other side of the border in Itaipulandia, killing three and arresting four others.

Six others were arrested in Brazil on Tuesday.

Authorities on both sides of the border have stepped up the search for the remaining gangsters. Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, said that his country will provide “all necessary resources” to find the criminals.

Changing diets, including more processed food that are high in salt, sugar and fat, along with more sedentary lifestyles have triggered a rising tide of obesity, experts say.

“The implications for the future of countries are frightening ... undernutrition is declining, but overnutrition is expected to become the largest social and economic burden in the region,” the UN World Food Programme (WFP) said in a statement.

The report by the WFP and the UN’s Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), said over the next six decades people being overweight and obese would cost Mexico an estimated $13bn a year, Ecuador $3bn and Chile $1bn.

Undernutrition, when people do not get enough food, and obesity – itself a form of malnutrition – are two sides of the same coin, and together they inflict a so-called “double burden” of disease on people and economies, the report said.

Undernutrition impairs child growth and brain development, while obesity can led to type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease.

“We now witness a worrying trend among vulnerable communities with cases of undernourishment and overweight simultaneously within the same families,” said Miguel Barreto, WFP’s regional director said in a statement.

“Both undernourishment and overweight represent a serious burden for the health of those families, that eventually translates into losses in productivity, and in pressure on the health and education systems in the country where they live.”

According to the World Health Organisation, obesity is an epidemic worldwide, killing 2.8 million adults every year, and obesity-related conditions now cause more deaths than hunger.

In Latin America, obesity is increasingly affecting the region’s poor, particularly women.

In Mexico, a country that faces one of the world’s most acute obesity crisis, 74% of women are obese or overweight compared with 70% of men, the report said.

The report urged food companies to play a greater role in combating obesity.

“The food industry has the opportunity to ensure the production, availability and accessibility of healthier food products,” it said.

Governments should also do more to promote exercise and health eating and place greater controls on food labelling.

The report noted Chile’s efforts to combat obesity, including an 18% tax on sugary drinks introduced in 2014 – one of the world’s highest – along with laws that restrict the advertising of unhealthy foods targeting children.

In 2014, Mexico also introduced a 10% tax on fizzy drinks, and 2016 research by the British Medical Journal found that the sugar tax led to as much as a 12% reduction in sales during the first year it was implemented.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/25/the-guardian-view-on-venezuela-a-country-in-pain,"Venezuela’s president Nicolás Maduro has failed his country. Picked by Hugo Chávez as successor just before his death in 2013, President Maduro has been an incompetent leader in hard times. He has failed to address the economic crisis triggered when the fall in the price of oil exposed the weaknesses of Chavismo, his predecessor’s ambitious experiment in poverty alleviation and social ownership. Now, in what was once South America’s richest country, more than four households in five are in poverty, twice the level of when he came to power. Babies and children die for lack of access to commonplace medicines. Murder and kidnapping for ransom are rife. Inflation is running above 800%; the economy is contracting sharply. Democracy itself is being eroded as the president defends his faltering grip on power. Weeks of protests have been met by state violence, semi-official vigilantes and, increasingly, counterattack from some opposition groupings. There is a wretched stalemate; and there is a real fear that violence could soon escalate out of control.

Like many of its neighbours, Venezuela’s democrats have to overcome a troubled history of rule by elites with little concern for lifting people out of poverty or shared economic growth. For more than a decade, Chávez seemed to offer a better prospectus: decent housing, proper wages and a fairer future. But after his premature death, the fall in oil prices laid bare the old divisions. His detractors point to a mixture of corruption and his failure to set up a Norwegian-style wealth fund to invest some of an oil income that approached $1tn as causes of the crisis. His defenders accuse the old ruling elite and its supporters of sabotaging the revolution.

But in the past few days, there is a sense that a bridge has been crossed. For the first time, demonstrators have included people from the poorer parts of Caracas, the people who were at the heart of the Chavismo project. Mr Maduro is talking about resuming talks with the opposition, brokered by the Vatican. But there is deep cynicism about these overtures. The opposition suspect him of playing for time, and remember bitterly that the last time they placed their trust in the Vatican’s involvement the talks soon foundered on the president’s obduracy.

Venezuela is in great danger. This stand-off can only be resolved if both sides make some big and difficult decisions. The opposition must accept that protests on their own will not force the Maduro government from office, and that increasing violence on their side risks appearing to justify the use of force by the government. Instead, it must, in the words of one close observer, find a better way of increasing its leverage. That means uniting around concrete objectives such as a timetable for local and governorial elections. It means uniting behind a single leader, a putative presidential candidate that all factions trust – a tall order when one pre-eminent leader, Leopoldo López, is in prison and another, Henrique Capriles, has been banned. They must acknowledge that Chavismo still has a real hold on the hearts of many Venezuelans and any future settlement must make space for it; it cannot be the kind of exercise in revenge that has been seen too often in other South American countries.

Conspicuous respect for constitutionality for the opposition. On the other side, a genuine commitment to negotiation. Bringing the president and his allies to talk may take personal sanctions. Those would have to be imposed by a multilateral group of nations. Any direct action by the US alone plays straight into the Maduro narrative of American intervention. The international community could make the presidential elections due at the end of next year the target for settlement, and international pariah status the penalty for failing to reach it. These are immensely challenging ambitions; there are not even obvious trusted mediators. But the alternative is a dysfunctional country that brings nothing but insecurity and suffering to its citizens. And that never ends well.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/25/justin-trudeau-brother-marijuana-charge-dismissed-canada,"Days after his government confirmed that its plans to legalise marijuana will not include a blanket pardon for those with past pot convictions, Justin Trudeau has admitted that his late brother was once charged with marijuana possession – and that their father’s resources and connections helped make the charge “go away”.

The Canadian prime minister’s comments, made at a town hall meeting hosted by Vice Media, came in response to a young Canadian who said he had been charged with pot possession.

Trudeau’s Liberal government tabled legislation earlier this month to fully legalise marijuana by mid-2018, putting Canada on course to become the first country in the G7 to do so.

But the legislation has since been criticised by some over its failure to include an amnesty for those with pot-related convictions – despite the government’s acknowledgment that those with criminal records often have trouble finding work, housing or travelling outside the country.



Speaking on Monday, Trudeau detailed how his brother Michel – six months before he died in an avalanche in British Columbia – had in 1998 been involved in a car accident.

Police found a few joints in the wreckage and charged Michel with possession of marijuana. But their father – the former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau – assured him it would be OK. “He reached out to his friends in the legal community, got the best possible lawyer and was very confident that he was going to be able to make those charges go away,” Trudeau told the audience.

He continued: “We were able to do that because we had resources, my dad had a couple of connections, and we were confident that my little brother wasn’t going to be saddled with a criminal record for life.”

His comments come as his government is facing growing pressure to couple legalisation with a blanket pardon for those with criminal records for marijuana possession. Earlier this month, the CD Howe Institute, a Toronto-based thinktank, urged the government to consider pardons as a means of sparking economic activity – as doing so would allow some Canadians to better access job opportunities – while also freeing up government resources.

Others, such as the progressive New Democratic party, are calling on the government to immediately decriminalise the personal use of marijuana, describing the charges as a waste of resources that saddles people with criminal records for something the government no longer believes is a crime.

In 2015 – the last year for which figures are available – 49,577 Canadians were charged with possession of cannabis, according to Statistics Canada.

Bill Blair, the former Toronto police chief tapped to lead the government’s efforts towards legalisation, has suggested that the charges tend to disproportionately affect minority groups.

“One of the great injustices in this country is the disparity and the disproportionality of the enforcement of these laws and the impact it has had on minority communities, Aboriginal communities and those in our most vulnerable neighbourhoods,” Blair said last year.

As he shared his brother’s experience of being charged, Trudeau said the story highlighted how the current approach fails to treat all Canadians equally. “People from minority communities, marginalised communities, without economic resources, are not going to have that kind of option to go through and clear their name in the justice system,” he said. “That’s one of the fundamental unfairnesses of this current system is that it affects different communities in a different way.”

In 2013, Trudeau said in an interview that he had smoked marijuana five or six times in his life. The last time he had done so, he told the Huffington Post, was about two years after he was elected as an MP.

Still, his government has continually stressed that the current laws remain in effect until the laws around legalisation are changed. Police forces across the country have underscored the point several times in recent months, carrying out high-profile raids on marijuana dispensaries and arresting dozens of people.

On Monday, Trudeau suggested his government would address the issue of criminal charges once legalisation is approved. “Our focus is on making sure we’re changing the legislation to fix what’s broken about a system that is hurting Canadians,” he said. “And then we’ll take steps to look at what we can do for those people who have criminal records for something that would no longer be criminal.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/25/paraguay-heist-brazil-gangsters-dynamite-speedboat,"Using automatic rifles, dynamite and anti-aircraft guns, around 50 gangsters turned city into a battle zone before fleeing in speedboats with about $8m

Brazilian gangsters have taken armed robbery to a lethal new level with a cross-border attack on a Paraguayan security vault and police headquarters using automatic rifles, dynamite and anti-aircraft guns in what local media have described as “the heist of the century”.



One police officer was murdered in the assault and three suspects were killed by police after they fled the scene and crossed the river border in speedboats with an estimated $8m.

Using diversion strategies and a degree of firepower usually reserved for wars, around 50 gangsters – believed to be from the First Capital Command (better known by its Portuguese acronym PCC) – turned the city of Ciudad del Este into a battle zone for more than three hours early on Monday morning.

Soon after midnight, they torched vehicles to block access roads into the police headquarters, which they then raked with gunfire and bombarded with grenades and molotov cocktails filled with bullets to give the impression of a larger attacking force.



But the attack on the police was only a diversion: soon after it was launched, another, larger group of gunmen assaulted the headquarters of a private security company, Prosegur.

They killed a policeman, who was reportedly asleep in his car, then choked the main road outside the building with burning cars and shot at any vehicle that approached. Anti-aircraft guns were deployed in case the police tried to approach the area by helicopter, though that did not happen.

Using explosives, the thieves blasted the main concrete wall housing access to the vault. It is unclear how many they were able to break into, but they reportedly stole $8m of the $49m held inside. Closed-circuit cameras show the heavily armed assailants wearing ski masks and speaking Portuguese.

A battle then ensued with police who had been called to the scene. But the gangsters – who had infrared sights and automatic weapons – were more heavily armed. The officers only had their regulation handguns because the arsenal at headquarters was blocked.

Local residents recorded the sounds and flashes of the confrontation on cellphones. For more than two hours, the streets echoed with gunfire and explosions. At least three bystanders and one policeman were injured.

“The security firm’s premises have been destroyed in an attack caused chaos and terror in the city,” Justo Zacarias, the governor of surrounding Alto Parana state, told reporters.

The thieves split into three groups and drove off in security vans, lobbing explosives and spikes behind them to prevent anyone from following. Police later found an abandoned van containing heavy weapons, traces of blood and bulletproof vests.

They are thought to have crossed the Parana river in speedboats.

Brazilian police intercepted one group 50km (31 miles) on the other side of the border in Itaipulandia, killing three and arresting four others.

Six others were arrested in Brazil on Tuesday.

Authorities on both sides of the border have stepped up the search for the remaining gangsters. Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, said that his country will provide “all necessary resources” to find the criminals.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/24/canada-tim-hortons-coffee-uk-donuts-glasgow,"Company fabled for donuts and sugary ‘double double’ plans more British outlets after European debut in Glasgow but is it here too late in the day?

Canadian company Tim Hortons is to open its first UK coffee shop in May, entering the crowded but still growing British market for food and drink on the go.

Promising to bring its “signature coffee, delicious food and Canadian charm” to the UK, the chain’s first UK coffee shop – also its first in Europe – will be on Argyle Street in central Glasgow, with further outlets planned in other city centre locations around the country.

The company is seeking to cash in on the UK’s fast-growing coffee market – where it faces intense competition from major players such as Starbucks and Costa, independent chains and low-cost operators.

Canada judge who wore Trump hat to court faces disciplinary hearing Read more

Tim Hortons – known for its red and white vintage-style branding – was founded in 1964 by its namesake (Miles “Tim” Horton), a professional ice hockey player who wanted to create cafes where everyone would feel at home.



Since then the brand has grown to become an ingrained part of Canadian culture, dominating its home market with locations in nearly every city and small town. It claims eight out of 10 cups of coffee sold across Canada are served at Tim Hortons, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International.

A recent report from Mintel showed the UK retail coffee market was worth £137m in 1997, but by 2016 it had ballooned to an estimated £3.4bn. Almost £1bn of this growth has come since 2011, making the UK an attractive proposition for international coffee shop chains.



Jonny Forsyth, Mintel’s global drinks analyst, said Tim Hortons faced challenges in terms of timing. “Competition has become incredibly intense and there are now simply too many brands in competition with each other,” he said.

“For example, Starbucks has announced disappointing results recently and is under threat from the growth of trendy independent coffee shops at the top end and also lower-priced, non-specialist operators such as JD Wetherspoon and Greggs.

“We are also starting to see inflation outstripping wage growth, which means UK consumers will have less disposable income in the lead-up to Brexit.”

Tim Hortons president Elias Díaz Sesé said: “Great Britain is a nation of coffee lovers, so we’re confident Tim Hortons will continue to be a leader in the quick service restaurant sector across the pond.”

Forsyth said a major obstacle for Tim Hortons was that “it is little known outside of its native Canada, something which explains why it also struggled to make inroads on the US coffee market in recent years”.

Tim Hortons’ signature freshly brewed drip coffee – medium roast and guaranteed to be served no more than 20 minutes after brewing – will be on sale in the UK. But British palates may find another Tim Hortons favourite in Canada, the “double-double” coffee served with two portions of cream and two sugars, a step too far.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/25/trump-signals-delay-on-border-wall-funding-to-avoid-government-shutdown,"President tells conservative media his $1.4bn demand could be pushed to September, avoiding a spending freeze on his 100th day in office

Donald Trump has indicated he is willing to delay his demand for funding of his Mexican border wall to avoid a shutdown of the federal government.



Trump, in a private meeting with conservative media outlets, said he might wait until Republicans begin drafting the budget blueprint for the fiscal year that starts on 1 October to seek government funds for building a wall along the US-Mexico border, the White House confirmed.

The border wall spending is fiercely opposed by Democrats and also unpopular with many Republicans.

Activism, cynicism – and whiskey: how readers are coping with Trump Read more

Trump, whose approval ratings have steadily declined since he took office, is facing a deadline on Friday for Congress to pass the spending bill funding the government through to September or risk marking his 100th day in office on Saturday with a government shutdown.

The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, who has a key role providing Democratic votes to pass the legislation, welcomed Trump’s reported shift on the wall.

“It’s good for the country that President Trump is taking the wall off the table in these negotiations,” Schumer said late on Monday.

“Now the bipartisan and bicameral negotiators can continue working on the outstanding issues.”

The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, said: “The president’s comments this evening are welcome news given the bipartisan opposition to the wall, and the obstacle it has been to the continuing bipartisan negotiations in the appropriations committees.”

Although Republicans control both chambers of Congress, a funding bill will need 60 votes to clear the 100-member Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats, meaning at least some Democrats will have to get behind it.

If no spending measure covering 29 April to 30 September is in place by midnight on Saturday, government funds will halt and hundreds of thousands of the country’s several million federal employees will be temporarily laid off.

Those in jobs deemed essential such as law enforcement are expected to keep working in the hope they will receive back pay. Non-essential sectors such as national parks are liable to be closed and programs such as federally funded medical research will grind to a halt.

100 days: how Donald Trump compares with last five presidents Read more

Failure to approve a government funding bill could also throw new doubts over Republicans’ ability to fashion a budget blueprint for the next fiscal year or to succeed in a major effort to cut corporate and individual taxes that Trump has touted.

Trump’s border wall was a central campaign pledge that he still insists Mexico will pay for in the end, though Democrats and even most Republicans doubt that will ever come to pass.

Cost estimates range beyond $20bn and the White House had been seeking $1.4bn as a down payment in the spending bill.

Congressional leaders will likely have to decide by late on Tuesday whether negotiations are progressing enough to try to pass a spending bill funding the government through September, Senator Roy Blunt, a member of the Republican leadership and Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters on Monday.

If negotiations have slowed or stalled Congress could pursue a short-term extension of existing spending levels to avoid a government shutdown, giving lawmakers more time to reach a deal. Leading Democrats have said they would support such a measure only if talks are progressing.

Trump has argued that a wall along the US-Mexico border is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States. In a Twitter message on Monday, Trump wrote: “If... the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be!”



Earlier on Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump’s demand that Congress include funds for the construction of the wall remained a White House priority.

“The president has made very clear that he’s got two priorities in this continuing resolution: number one, the increase in funding for the military and number two, for our homeland security and the wall,” Spicer told reporters.

The White House was confident in the direction of the talks and an announcement was expected soon, Spicer said, although he declined to say specifically whether Trump would sign a bill that did not contain money for border security and the wall.

Trump has said Mexico will repay the United States for the wall if Congress funds it first. But the Mexican government is adamant it will not provide any financing and Trump has not laid out a plan to compel it to pay. Department of Homeland Security internal estimates have placed the total cost of a border barrier at about $21.6bn.

Venezuela’s major transport arteries juddered to a halt on Monday as opposition protesters blocked major roads and staged sit-ins across the country.

Are you taking part in protests in Venezuela? Read more

Tens of thousands of people joined the latest protests, which follow a month of anti-government demonstrations, political clashes and looting that have left at least 22 people dead.

Four people were reported to have been killed, including two in the Andean state of Mérida, and two in the western Barinas state.



The turmoil – which is the bloodiest since 2014 – has been caused by worsening food shortages, rising unemployment and anger at President Nicolás Maduro’s increasingly authoritarian restrictions on elections and democratic institutions.



In Caracas, large crowds blocked the Francisco Fajardo freeway, the largest in the capital. Some waved upturned Venezuelan flags, a nautical signal of distress.



“I came because I want to see the end to this embarrassment of a government before I leave this world,” said 90-year-old Elba Pérez, who had walked more than two kilometres alongside her husband to join protesters. “I am quite old so I hope they hurry up.”



In Puerto Ordaz, a city in eastern Venezuela that was once a bastion of government support, protesters also blocked several of the city’s main avenues.

Carlos Márquez, a taxi driver, said he was joining the street protests because last year’s efforts to unseat the government through a signature campaign and recall referendum were denied by electoral authorities.



Márquez said that although he expected to lose all his business for the day, the protest was worth it. “I hope the government calls for elections so that this doesn’t take a violent turn,” he said.



Venezuela's anger is on the streets. But the ballot box remains key for change Read more

Unlike most previous rallies, the current wave of protests have well-defined goals: an electoral calendar, the liberation of all political prisoners and the re-establishment of constitutional norms, including the separation of powers.



The latter is a major source of concern. Last month, the supreme court briefly stripped parliament of its authority. The ruling has since been partially reversed but the opposition say the judiciary should be changed because it has put politics above the constitution.



Law student José Fernández said he wanted to live in a country where the rule of law is respected.



“We will come out as often and stay as long as we need to, until Maduro announces general elections.”



On Sunday, during his weekly televised address to the nation, Maduro said his party was ready to contest regional elections. “I want elections now. This is what I say as head of state, as head of government.” After last Wednesday’s huge and bloody demonstrations, he had also talked vaguely of “prompt and total elections”.



But opposition leader Henrique Capriles has said that the protests will continue until the government adheres to the country’s constitution.

A powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.1 has struck off the west coast of Chile, rocking the capital Santiago and generating at least two significant aftershocks.

No major damage was immediately apparent, according to an assessment by Chile’s emergency services. The Chilean navy and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake was not expected to cause a tsunami.

The quake was centered 22 miles (35km) west of the coastal city of Valparaíso at a shallow depth of 6.2 miles (10km) below the seabed, the US Geological Survey said.

Chilean authorities initially ordered a preventive evacuation of the coastal area near Valparaíso, some 60 miles west of Santiago, in case of a tsunami, but canceled it shortly afterward. Local residents reported panic on the streets of Valparaíso.

How did Chile manage to survive its recent earthquake virtually unscathed? Read more

A magnitude 7.1 quake is considered major and is capable of causing widespread and heavy damage, but the effects of this one would have been tempered because it was offshore.

At least two aftershocks of magnitudes 5.0 and 5.4 were recorded in the same spot and could be felt in Santiago.

Chile, located on the so-called “Pacific Ring of Fire”, has a long history of deadly quakes, including a 8.8 magnitude quake in 2010 off the south-central coast, which also triggered a tsunami that devastated coastal towns.

That was the sixth-largest earthquake ever recorded, according to the USGS. The largest recorded temblor in history was also in Chile, a 9.5-magnitude quake in 1960.

A major 7.6 magnitude earthquake jolted southern Chile on Christmas Day 2016, prompting thousands to evacuate coastal areas, but no fatalities or major damage were reported in the tourism and salmon farming region.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/24/canada-basic-income-trial-ontario-summer,"About 4,000 low-income participants in Canadian province will receive monthly payments to assess whether program can provide stability and positive changes

The Canadian province of Ontario will launch a trial run of universal basic income with about 4,000 participants this summer, making it the first North American government in decades to test out a policy touted as a panacea to poverty, bloated bureaucracy and the rise of precarious work.

Participants in the three-year, C$150m pilot program will be drawn from the cities of Hamilton, Thunder Bay and Lindsay. A randomly selected mail-out will invite applications in the coming months, with participants screened to ensure they are between the ages of 18 and 64 years and living on a low income.



The pilot will include a mix of those who are working in low-paying or precarious jobs and those on social assistance, with participants able to opt out at any point during the three years.

“This is a new world with new challenges,” Kathleen Wynne, Ontario’s premier, said on Monday as she announced details of the highly anticipated pilot. “From technology to Trump, it is a time of greater uncertainty and change.”

The pilot aims to answer whether basic income – an idea long touted by those on the left and right – is an effective means of addressing this unpredictability. Unconditional monthly payments will begin to flow this summer; single people will receive up to C$16,989 ($12,570) while couples will receive C$24,027. All participants will continue to receive child or disability benefits, if applicable.

The monthly income represents a slight increase for those currently on social assistance or disability support but come with less monitoring and administration. Those who work will see the amount of their basic income reduced by 50 cents for every dollar they earn.



“It’s not an extravagant sum by any means,” said Wynne. “But our goal is clear. We want to find out whether a basic income makes a positive difference in people’s lives. Whether this new approach gives them the ability to begin to achieve their potential.”

The outcomes of the monthly stipend will be monitored on an ongoing basis, with researchers delving into its impact on health, education, housing and labour market participation. The province is also in the early stages of working with aboriginal partners to develop a parallel pilot that would test the idea among First Nations communities.

The scheme began last June, when the provincial government tasked a Conservative political strategist and longtime advocate of the idea with exploring potential directions for the pilot.

The trial run in Ontario comes as the idea of basic income is undergoing a popular renaissance. As leaders around the world struggle to find a balance between fighting poverty, the push for austerity and the steady erosion of stable jobs with pension and benefits, basic income projects are in the pipeline in Finland, the Netherlands and Kenya.

Canadian officials have long held an interest in the merits of the idea – the country was once home to one of North America’s largest and most ambitious experiments in basic income.

Ontario pilot project puts universal basic income to the test Read more

In 1974, about 1,000 residents in Dauphin, a small farming town of 10,000 people in Manitoba, began receiving monthly payments with no strings attached. The pilot, a joint effort by the federal and provincial government, set the stipend at around 60% of Statistics Canada’s poverty threshold, translating to roughly C$16,000 a year in today’s dollars for a single person. For every dollar earned from other income sources, 50 cents were scaled back from the monthly payment.

The payments flowed for four years, turning Dauphin into a potent test site for the policy. Research found little change in the residents’ work habits, save for new mothers who took longer maternity leaves and teenage boys who were more likely to stay in high school.

Instead the monthly income became a source of stability, buffering residents from financial ruin in the case of sudden illness, disability or unpredictable economic events. Hospitalisations dropped, as did injuries and mental health issues.

But the budget of $17m – the equivalent of about $85m today – ran short , hindering data analysis. A growing federal push for austerity along with a change in Manitoba’s government in 1977 sounded the final death knell for the project.

Ontario’s pilot project risks falling victim to the same pressures. A provincial election is expected to be held by mid-2018, coming one year into the pilot program. Polls currently suggest that the Liberal government, who have held power in the province for some 14 years, are unlikely to win another majority government. Soaring electricity prices and allegations of bribery in a 2015 byelection are among the issues that have sent Wynne’s approval ratings tumbling to around 12% – the lowest of any premier in Canada.",guardian.com,False
