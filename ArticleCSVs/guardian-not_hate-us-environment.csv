The US Environmental Protection Agency’s main climate change website is “undergoing changes” to better reflect “the agency’s new direction” under Donald Trump.

The American people – not Big Oil – must decide our climate future | Senator Bernie Sanders and Mark Jacobson Read more

The announcement, made late Friday evening, left empty what was previously the “official government site” providing “comprehensive information on the issue of climate change and global warming”.

The change came a day before thousands gathered in Washington DC and other US cities to protest inaction on climate change, and hours before the symbolic 100-day mark of the Trump administration.

At the marquee climate protest, the Peoples Climate March in Washington, tens of thousands made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue in sweltering heat on their way to encircle the White House.

Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco. In Chicago, marchers headed from the city’s federal plaza to Trump Tower. In Denver, marchers were met with a dose of spring snow.

Some of the marches drew celebrity attendees, including former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the capital and senator and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders at an event in Montpelier, Vermont.

“Honored to join Indigenous leaders and native peoples as they fight for climate justice,” DiCaprio tweeted.

Any marchers who used their phones to look at the EPA climate change website would have been greeted with a message from the new administration: “This page is being updated.”

“As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,” said JP Freire, an associate administrator for public affairs.

Previously, the website housed data on greenhouse gas emissions from large polluters and reports on the effects of climate change and its impact on human health.

“We want to eliminate confusion,” Freire said, “by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we’re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law.”

The Trump administration has called for budget cuts of nearly one-third at the EPA and has sought to weaken protections for human health. For instance, the White House has proposed cutting funding and regulations regarding lead poisoning prevention and is considering rewriting regulations concerning smog.

It has already rolled back a law that prevented coal mining companies from dumping waste in streams.

In an op-ed piece for the Guardian published on Saturday, Sanders made an economic case for a focus on industries meant to ameliorate the effects of climate change, rather than those which contribute to it.

The senator from Vermont wrote: “No matter what agenda President Trump and his administration of climate deniers push, it is clear that jobs in clean energy like wind and solar are growing much more rapidly than jobs in the coal, oil and gas sectors.”",guardian.com,False

In an “unprecedented” rash of attacks, a pod of killer whales in Monterey Bay, California, has killed four gray whales in a week, including a calf whose killing was captured on video, according to one marine biologist.

An extraordinary battle between sperm whales and orcas – in pictures Read more

In the most recent attack, the group of nine orcas on Wednesday took only 20 minutes to separate a mother gray whale from her calf and kill the young whale. Attacks usually take hours and often end in failure for the killer whales, said Nancy Black, a marine biologist who recorded the attacks.

“I’ve been studying them for 30 years here,” Black told the Guardian. “This has really never happened before.”

Black said the rate of kills was “like a record” for the pod, which includes four generations of whales, led by a matriarchy. “It’s kind of exciting to see this group and how they’ve gotten really good at hunting,” Black said. “It’s pretty unprecedented just because the same group of killer whales has been feeding on them each time.”

Orcas who are not members of the pod have joined some of the hunts, Black said. During the first hunt, last week, 33 whales joined the attack and subsequent feast. “One whale is a lot of food for one group,” Black said.

Grey whales have been late to migrate from the lagoons of Mexico up to the coast of northern California this year, and Black hypothesized that the orca killing spree was related to the late start of their hunting season. The last kill, she said, seemed to be a case in which the mother grey whale was herself not healthy enough to protect her calf. “I think the killer whales were getting anxious, almost waiting for them to come.”

Killer whales prey on gray whale and humpback whale calves, seals, sea lions, dolphins, tuna and great white sharks, among other marine life. When they attack other whales, they work like a pack of wolves to separate a mother from her calf, trying to wedge their way between the larger whales while nipping and distracting at the adult. All the while the orcas try to avoid the mother whale’s gigantic tail, powerful enough to seriously injure or kill an orca.

Young orcas hover near the hunt, watching and learning from the other females. Once they separate the grey whales, the orcas concentrate on the calf. “There’s not much the mother can do at that point,” Black said, though mother whales often linger at the scene of the hunt until they are certain their calf is killed.

Humpback whales sometimes fight back as a group against the orcas, Black noted, calling a peculiar behavior “altruistic”. “In areas where killer whales are trying to catch prey,” she said, “the humpbacks come charging in with trumpets blowing, all excited, and they try to prevent the killer whales from killing their prey, whether it’s a seal or even a grey whale.”

Several dozen humpbacks have returned to Monterey early this year, drawing tourists to the Monterey Bay Whale Watch group to which Black belongs. She said it was difficult to say why the humpbacks charged the orcas when humpback calves weren’t threatened. “It could be they’re just trying to get their own predators away from anything they’re hunting at all.”",guardian.com,False

It seems the Earth has a sense of irony. “Record-breaking heat” is possible at the People’s Climate March in DC on Saturday, where thousands of people are planning to protest against the president’s climate change policies on his 100th day in office. Trump’s initiatives include, but are not limited to, a 31% cut in the Environmental Protection Agency and potentially leaving the Paris climate agreement.

Among those suffering in the heat will be former vice-president Al Gore and, apparently, Leonardo DiCaprio. It is likely to take a titanic effort to change the other Wolf of Wall Street’s mind, however, as Trump has repeatedly said that the inception of climate change had nothing to do with mankind. Only 1,361 more days of this to go!

A group of senators, including Resistance regular Bernie Sanders, this week unveiled legislation that aims to transition to 100% clean and renewable energy by 2050.

The resistance’s next target: big banks

Hundreds of thousands of immigrants and their allies will be striking and marching around the country on 1 May. The May Day protests are traditionally led by unions and labor groups, but this year – galvanized by the Trump administration – immigration, racial justice, gender equality and LGBT groups will be playing a big part.

Demonstrations will take place in a number of states. Activist groups are launching a “Corporate Backers of Hate Campaign” on the same day, which will see demonstrations at the offices of companies seen to be supporting or benefiting from the Trump presidency. Targets include JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs.

Luke Skywalker v Trump

Trump will be met by thousands of Luke Skywalkers, Hans Solos, and, depending on individuals’ tastes, Jar Jar Binkses when he returns to New York City next week.

It’s the president’s first trip to his home city since inauguration day but he will be met by protests. Given Trump’s visit comes on 4 May (May the fourth be with you, etc), organizers have called for activists to come clad in Star Wars gear.

The president, a noted fan of heavy machinery, will be visiting the USS Intrepid aircraft carrier-cum-museum with the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. The NYPD says it costs $308,000 a day to protect Trump during his New York jaunts.

Islamophobia on the rise

There has been a 1,035% spike in Islamophobic incidents at US borders during Trump’s first 100 days, according to the Council on American-Islamic relations (Cair).

In a press conference on Thursday Cair’s executive director, Nihad Awad, said the group, which he founded in 1994, had “never seen a spike” under any previous administration. A coalition of Muslim organizations is holding a two-day meeting in Washington on 1-2 May when they will lobby elected representatives to take action.

What we’re reading

• “Trump is the worst thing that could have happened to the planet,” writes climate activist Bill McKibben, but his catastrophic attitude towards the environment has at least forced politicians, and some private enterprises, to step up.

• In related news, the Trump administration is considering allowing oil and gas companies to drill off the Atlantic seaboard. The president has ordered his interior department to “review offshore areas potentially rich in fossil fuels that were put out of reach of drilling by Barack Obama’s administration”, according to Oliver Milman.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/28/sunscreen-damage-coral-research-oxybenzone,"For years we’ve been told to slap on sunscreen to protect against the harmful effects of the sun’s UV rays. But eco-conscious beachgoers may want to take care with their sunscreen this summer, as studies show that many contemporary sunscreens pose a threat to the ocean environment.

Oxybenzone is a common chemical found in all types of sunscreen, but particularly in the spray-on variety, that researchers have found harms coral, and is in high concentrations at some of the most world’s most popular reefs.

The UV-absorbing chemical found to poison coral in several ways. In a study published in 2015 and in research set for publication later this year, biologists found that oxybenzone contributes to bleaching, has a similar effect on DNA to gasoline, and disrupts reproduction and growth, leaving young corals fatally deformed.

“It causes weird deformities in soft tissue and also causes the coral larvae to encase itself in its own skeleton, in its own coffin,” said Craig Downs, one of the study authors.

The recent research builds on several years of work by teams in Italy, Spain, Israel and Iran, and found that even small doses of oxybenzone – about a drop in six-and-a-half Olympic swimming pools – damages coral. The researchers found concentrations 12 times that rate in popular waters off Hawaii and the US Virgin Islands. Hawaii lawmakers are proposing a ban on the use of such sunscreen on the islands.

In the Caribbean, Downs said, the researchers noticed that bays popular with sunscreen-slathered tourists had dead and sterile coral, while those with little traffic were healthy. “In one there’s just nothing there, it’s a desolate wasteland,” he said. “Two bays over, at a $1,000-a-night resort, where very few people go, there’s lots of coral recruitment, lots of spiny sea urchins.”

The scientists argue that this difference shows that climate change alone is not responsible for coral die-offs, and that such cases add to evidence that pollutants created sterile, “zombie” reefs. Downs’ team has also found that oxybenzone has toxic effects on fish larvae and embryos.

The findings by Downs and his colleagues has some limits, for instance pending review of unpublished work. Mike van Keulen, a biologist at Murdoch University in Australia, also noted that it was performed in a laboratory, raising concerns about how its findings apply in the wild. But Van Keulen agreed that their field readings were very high, meaning Downs’ fears were reasonable, especially around tourist spots like Hawaii, the Caribbean and parts of the Great Barrier Reef.

“The more insidious aspect of the toxicity is the ever-increasing pollution load in the world’s oceans,” van Keulen said. “They’re all connected, and background levels of pollutants are becoming a major concern in even very remote locations.”

Like microplastics, sewage and coastal development, sunscreens add stress that erode coral resilience, he said. “This means that reefs are weakened and can’t bounce back from the global events, like bleaching, acidification, etc.”

Hundreds of sunscreen products use oxybenzone, including those made by Coopertone and Banana Boat. Some manufacturers have started to produce sunscreens marketed as “reef friendly”, but scientists warn that, like the labels “healthy” and “natural” for food, there is little to no regulation over such claims and consumers should check ingredients.

L’Oréal, one of the companies that has publicly disputed the research, did not respond to a request for comment. A company researcher, Marc Leonard, told Nature earlier this year that lawmakers should not act without more studies.

Lobbying groups, including the DC-based Consumer Healthcare Products Association, also oppose the ban. The latter group’s vice-president, Carlos Gutiérrez, told Hawaiian lawmakers late last month that he believes climate change is the primary driver of coral death.

“A greater standard of evidence must be considered before a product so valuable to people’s health is prohibited,” he said. The American Academy of Dermatology has said oxybenzone is safe for humans, but Downs said that, based on research of its effects, he no longer felt comfortable letting his children in a swimming pool.

Hawaiian tourist agencies have largely argued the ban is needed to protect reefs, one of the state’s most valuable attractions. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has estimated that coral reefs are worth tens of billions to the US for their value to fisheries, tourism and as buffers against storms.

Regional offices of the National Park Services, including in Hawaii, the Virgin Islands and south Florida, advise swimmers use sunscreens made with zinc oxide or titanium oxide, which biodegrade, and several Mexican preserves require visitors to use biodegradable sunscreens. Downs said that consumers should take extra care not to use sunscreens advertising “nano” zinc oxide or titanium oxide, saying that below 120 or just 100 nanometers is “significantly toxic”.

Scientists also warn against using aerosol cans of sunscreen, because the spray mostly falls on to sand, where it gets washed into the sea or into sea turtle nests.",guardian.com,False

2008

TransCanada proposes expanding an existing pipeline to transport oil from Hardisty, Alberta to Port Arthur, Texas, to transfer Canadian tar sands oil to US refineries. It was scheduled to be completed by 2013.

July 2010

The Environmental Protection Agency concludes that a state department assessment of the environmental impact of pipeline was insufficient, slowing the approval process.

November 2011

With a US government decision on the pipeline due by the end of 2011, thousands of people protest at the White House in a bid to persuade Barack Obama to block it. Environmental groups frame the decision as one that will define Obama’s legacy on climate change.

US state department, which is involved because the pipeline crosses the US-Canada border, tells TransCanada to reroute the pipeline. TransCanada agrees.



January 2012

Obama rejects TransCanada’s application to build the pipeline, but holds the door open to considering a new submission.

May 2012

TransCanada submits new application to the US state department for the northern section of the project.

March 2013

The state department publishes an environmental review which says the pipeline would not have a big impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The southern leg of the pipeline, from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the gulf coast, is also completed in 2013.

January 2014

The state department reiterates its view that carbon emissions from the project would not be significant.

November 2015



Weeks before the historic Paris climate change conference, Obama says the state department has rejected the pipeline and he agrees with the decision. He argued it would undercut US leadership on reducing carbon emissions. TransCanada said the decision was bad for the US and Canadian economies.

January 2017



Within days of taking office, Donald Trump signs an executive order to revive the Keystone XL pipeline, as well as the fiercely opposed Dakota Access pipeline. Two days later, TransCanada submits a presidential permit application to the state department.

Donald Trump announced a “new era of American energy policy” as he signed the presidential permit allowing TransCanada to build the Keystone XL pipeline.

“It’s going to be an incredible pipeline. Greatest technology known to man. Or woman. And frankly, we’re very proud of it,” said Trump in the Oval Office on Friday morning.

The proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which had been suspended after years of opposition by environmental and Native American activists and others, would carry 800,000 barrels of tar sands oil from the fields in Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would meet another Keystone pipeline to send the oil to refineries on the gulf coast.

Activist groups vowed that the pipeline project would not be resurrected and said Trump did not understand the process to restart it.

“Game on,” said Bill McKibben, co-founder of the environmental advocacy group 350.org, in a conference call with reporters. “The fight will be very real, and very intense. There are millions and millions of Americans who are committed to ensuring the Keystone Pipeline never gets built.

“The president, as he approved this thing this morning, as he issued the permit, he turned to the CEO of the Canadian company to build it and said: ‘When does construction start?’

“And the actual answer to that is, never. This project is going to be fought at every turn.”

In his Oval Office appearance, Trump was told that in order to move forward, the project still would need a state permit issued by Nebraska, which the pipeline would cross. The president responded that the state governor, Pete Ricketts, the scion of a billionaire family of prominent Republican donors, is “a fantastic governor, I’ll call him today”.

But Jane Kleeb, president of the activist group Bold Alliance, told reporters that the governor did not control the permitting process, and that the approval of five elected commissioners in Nebraska would be required to move it forward.

“[Trump] is so arrogant to think that a phone call to Governor Ricketts would somehow grant and green-light this project in our state,” Kleeb said. “News flash to President Trump: Governor Ricketts actually has no role in the permitting process in Nebraska.”

In his Oval Office appearance, Trump addressed Russ Girling, the president and CEO of TransCanada, joking about the years of delays the project has faced because of strong objections from local community and environmental grassroots protests against the pipeline.

“I hope you don’t pay your consultants anything because they had nothing to do with the approval. In fact, you should ask for your hundreds of millions of dollars back that you pay them because they didn’t do a damn thing except give you a no vote, right?” quipped Trump.

The president also seemed surprised by some details of the announcement, exclaiming “Wow!” when reading out a statement that the pipeline would be 900 miles long.

The state department says it is confident that building the pipeline serves the US national interest. That is the opposite conclusion to the one the state department reached during the Obama administration.

“In making his determination that issuance of this permit would serve the national interest, the under secretary considered a range of factors, including but not limited to foreign policy; energy security; environmental, cultural and economic impacts; and compliance with applicable law and policy,” the department said, according to the Hill website.

The remarks contrasted sharply with Barack Obama’s comments in November 2015, when he rejected the Keystone XL deal after seven years of political debate and grassroots campaigning.

“America is now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action on climate change,” declared Obama then.

“Frankly, approving that project would have undercut that global leadership, and that is the biggest risk we face: not acting.”

The pipeline is to run over the Ogallala aquifer, a huge underground reservoir in the Great Plains that provides water access to millions, including several Native American tribes.

Environmental activists condemned Trump’s plan. .

The author and activist Naomi Klein, a longtime Keystone opponent, called it “a disaster for the planet” in a statement:

“This is no surprise coming from a State Department headed by a man who was CEO of Exxon until a couple of months ago, and from a White House for whom digging up planet-destabilizing carbon is the centrepiece of its jobs plan, despite the fact that renewables and energy efficiency have the capacity to create exponentially more jobs.”

Klein went on to note the hypocritical actions of liberal Canadian politicians involved in approving the project: “A greater scandal is that Keystone’s approval has been cheered on by the Liberal prime minister of Canada and the social democratic premier of Alberta, both of whom position themselves as bold climate leaders. And both of whom have collaborated to win the approval of two other tar sands pipeline projects in the past few months: Enbridge’s Line 3 and Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain expansion.”

Although the state department noted the economic impact in its decision, the project will result in only 35 permanent jobs after initial construction.

The permit was signed by Tom Shannon, a career diplomat serving as under secretary of state for political affairs. That is because secretary of state Rex Tillerson recused himself due to his previous work running Exxon Mobil.

Just four weeks after Obama halted the Keystone XL pipeline, the US joined nearly 200 countries in pledging to cut carbon emissions in the historic Paris climate deal.

Throughout the election campaign, Trump promised to withdraw the US from the Paris accord, although in late November he said he had an “open mind” about the plan.

The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has recused himself from issues related to TransCanada Corp’s application for a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, the state department said in a letter on Thursday to the environmental group Greenpeace.

“He has not worked on that matter at the Department of State, and will play no role in the deliberations or ultimate resolution of TransCanada’s application,” said the letter from Katherine McManus, the state department’s deputy legal adviser.

McManus’s letter came after Greenpeace wrote to officials at the state department and the Office of Government Ethics on Wednesday, urging Tillerson to recuse himself from any decisions on the multibillion-dollar pipeline, given his former role as chief executive officer of ExxonMobil.

How Keystone XL and Dakota Access went from opposition to resurrection Read more

Greenpeace argued in its letter that ExxonMobil would “directly and predictably” benefit from the approval of Keystone XL because the firm has investments in Canadian oil sands.

Tillerson recused himself from the matter in early February, McManus wrote.

TransCanada tried for more than five years to build the 1,179 mile (1,897km) pipeline, until Barack Obama rejected it in 2015.

TransCanada resubmitted its application for the Keystone project in January, after Donald Trump signed an order smoothing its path.

The line is designed to link existing pipeline networks in Canada and the United States to bring crude from Alberta and North Dakota to refineries in Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico.

Exxon has a majority stake in Imperial Oil, a Calgary, Alberta-based company that operates the Kearl oil sands project in northern Alberta.

“ExxonMobil could benefit from the approval of the pipeline if it has specific contracts or agreements with TransCanada either to transport their Canadian tar sands production, or to receive such shipments at their US refineries,” Greenpeace wrote in its letter on Wednesday.

Tillerson wrote in a January letter to McManus that for one year after his resignation from ExxonMobil, he “will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I know that ExxonMobil is a party or represents a party, unless I am first authorized to participate”.

He also wrote that “on a case-by-case basis”, he would recuse himself “from participation in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I determine that a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts would question my impartiality in the matter, unless I am first authorized to participate”.",guardian.com,False

The sun has not long disappeared below the rolling hills of the highlands when the locals begin to muster.

There are angry mutterings and shaking of heads among the 50-odd filling the old village hall in Exeter, two hours south of Sydney.

They are here to voice their anger about the underground coalmine a subsidiary of the Korean steel-making giant Posco wants to build on their doorstep.

The mood is tense. The creaking of a door as it’s opened and closed by a government official is enough to make one local snap.

“Can you just shut it?” he barks.

Hume Coal mine would threaten water and net just $6m in royalties a year for NSW Read more

He is straining to hear what New South Wales planning authorities have to say about Hume Coal’s proposal to extract 3.5m tonnes of coal a year, which will lower the area’s overall groundwater level.

The plan, if approved, would threaten the bore water relied on by farmers and property owners.

Ninety-three groundwater bores used by 71 landholders will be affected for an average of 36 years. The government officials explain that is a significant impact compared with other coalmines, and is largely due to the shallowness of the coal deposit.

Officials say the drawdown in water levels could be anywhere from two to 80 metres.



“Two to what?” one local exclaims from the back.

The room hushes slightly as Matthew and Kym Burrows get to their feet. The couple own a commercial olive grove on the project site. The thousands of trees lining the property produce award-winning Sutton Forest olive oil, and Matthew tells the room they depend on the pristine water lying below.

The mere proposal to extract the coal has already hit them hard. Banks are refusing to finance expansion of the business, saying the land has lost 30% of its value owing to the as-yet-unapproved mine.

They have had to lay off two workers, and Matthew has suffered depression and drinking problems as he despairs for his farm’s future. His voice catches with emotion as he puts this to the government.

“Do you take that into consideration? If our business is destroyed, which it probably will be, will your department recommend we be compensated for 20 years’ worth of hard work and loss of future income?”

Hume Coal began explorative drilling in 2011 and now plans to extract 35% of the coal in the deposit over 19 years, giving a further two years for rehabilitation.

The company would leave pillars of coal in place to prevent the surface from collapsing. An unusual “pine feather” method would be used to pull out the coal, a type of underground recovery akin to longwall mining.

It would be stored at a large stockpile nearby, transported out using a new extension to the region’s main southern railway, and mostly sent to Port Kembla for export.

The company says it has carefully considered the impact on groundwater and would pay for mitigation measures that would prevent any disruption to bore water.

A Hume Coal spokesman, Ben Fitzsimmons, says locals’ fears about groundwater are based on misunderstandings. He says the company is compelled by the NSW government’s aquifer interference policy to ensure landholders do not lose bore water at any stage. The company plans to drill deeper bores and upgrade pumps for affected properties.

“The onus is on Hume Coal to make good any impacts on groundwater,” he says. “And through our mine design we’ve been able to achieve impacts on groundwater that can be mitigated, and no landholder will go without groundwater.”

But the executive director of the NSW Department of Planning and Environment, David Kitto, says the mitigation measures lack detail. He wants to see more from the company.

The locals here are not typical laypeople. Among those opposed to the project is Bruce Robertson, a Berrima berry farmer who is a retired supervising geologist with four decades’ experience in coalmining.



Another is Colin Grant, a former chief executive of Biosecurity Australia and the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme.

They give the opponents an ability to sift through the spin.

Grant has been in the area on and off for 10 years, commuting to and from Canberra, but has lived here semi-permanently for the past eight months.

He fears the company, if it gains its approval, will start pushing the boundaries and ask to extract more and more coal.

“There are risks in all of this, in terms of creep, approval creep,” Grant tells Guardian Australia.



“They’ve said they want 35%, but then it will be a little more, and a bit more, and they’ll keep coming back, because I don’t believe the economics stack up.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A Hume Coal visualisation of its proposed mine site

Grant’s concern about the viability of the proposal is shared by many. The extraction method is relatively expensive and will recover relatively little, while the overall global demand for coal is flatlining.

The department has confirmed that taxpayers would receive only about $120m in today’s dollars over the two-decade life of the mine.

The amount gained in royalties, Grant says, would probably be less than the cost of compensating landholders and forgone tax revenue from impacts on local businesses.

“It’s negligible,” he says. “And yet the loss here, in terms of prospective business benefits, I suspect over that period of time will exceed that.”

But the company says a mine would bring other benefits to the region, and commissioned a cost-benefit analysis that suggests the net economic impact would be positive.

It says 400 jobs would be created during construction and a further 300 during operation. Fitzsimmons says the job estimates are conservative.

Three hundred jobs during operations for a period of up to 20 years, that’s a pretty good employment Ben Fitzsimmons, Hume Coal

“Three hundred jobs during operations for a period of up to 20 years, that’s a pretty good employment for an area that’s experiencing severe unemployment or underemployment,” he says.

The company has set up a charitable foundation and an apprenticeship program. But the gestures do not appear to be winning over the community.

Groups have sprung up in opposition to the project, including Battle for Berrima, which conducted door-to-door surveys of surrounding regions, showing overwhelming opposition. In Exeter 94% of those surveyed were against the project. The result was largely the same in Berrima.

Battle for Berrima’s vice-president, Michael Verberkt, fears the mine will threaten Berrima’s ability to pull in tourists. The town trades on its status as one of best-preserved examples of a Georgian village in Australia.

The project would require eight trains a day to take coal from the mine. The company’s environmental impact statement suggests there are now 120 movements along the main railway each week. That would increase by 50 if the mine was approved.

The noise would be compounded by trucks, operations and maintenance work, locals say.

Verberkt is also worried that winds will carry particles from the coal stockpile to nearby villages. Mining more coal in an era of climate change and slowing demand makes no sense, he says.

“It’s time to move on and start getting serious about other alternatives, of which there are many out there.”

Back in Exeter’s village hall, the meeting is over. Members of the crowd are approaching Matthew Burrows, patting him on the shoulder, thanking him for his bravery. Most people here know him and it wasn’t easy to speak openly of his depression.

But shared adversity has a way of unifying communities.

When the Hume Coal workers tried to access a property next to the Burrows’ olive grove six years ago, locals came up with a cunning plan. They threw an inconveniently placed, impromptu street party on the main access road. There was dancing, music and food. A friend pitched in a floodlight.

The party morphed into a roadblock and a 24-hour roster was drawn up to ensure the street was continuously blocked. It lasted eight months.

“That’s the one good thing to come out of this,” Kym Burrows tells Guardian Australia. “I’ve made so many good friends through this whole process. It’s brought the whole community together.”

The approval process for the mine still has a long way to go. Even once a decision is made, there is room for appeals on both sides.

Submissions are being taken on the environmental impact statement for 90 days, and the company is holding its own consultations just before that period ends.

The locals are frustrated by the uncertainty and fear the fight will drag on for years. Even if they win, they worry another company will come along.

At the meeting a Berrima resident, Ian Burns, asks the planning authorities: “How do we get rid of this project forever?”

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/28/power-plants-will-have-to-cut-toxic-emmisions-under-new-eu-rules,"New rules to limit air pollutants such as nitrogen oxide and mercury could save more than 20,000 lives a year, say NGOs

Power plants in the EU will have to cut the amount of toxic pollutants such as nitrogen oxides they emit under new rules approved by member states and widely applauded by environmental groups.

Friday’s decision imposes stricter limits on emissions of pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, mercury and particulate matter from large combustion plants in Europe.

“Air pollution is the prime environmental cause of premature death in the European Union,” said Enrico Brivio, a spokesman for the European commission.

Large combustion plants account for a big share of air pollutant emissions across the EU: 46% of sulphur dioxide, 18% of nitrogen oxide, 39% of mercury and 4% of dust, he added.

NGOs say the new rules could save more than 20,000 lives every year by reducing pollution from coal-fired power plants alone.

The EU’s industrial emissions directive, its main instrument regulating pollutant emissions from industrial plants, entered into force in 2011. It sets EU-wide emission limits on large combustion plants for certain pollutants which can cause respiratory diseases.

However, the directive has been criticized for exemptions which have allowed more than half of Europe’s coal plants to exceed limits for harmful pollutants, according to a report by environmental groups last year.

Several countries which are heavily reliant on coal, such as Poland, Bulgaria, Germany and the Czech Republic, were opposed to the changes.

“EU coal power plants will now either have to reduce their pollution or close down,” said Darek Urbaniak, senior energy policy officer at WWF. “It is about time Europe quits its dirty coal addiction for good and invests in energy efficiency and renewables instead.”

There had been concerns in some countries, such as Bulgaria, that power plants would be forced to close down or that electricity prices would go up, but Brivio said “the European law does not require the closure of Bulgarian plants and will not increase the price of electricity.”

National authorities will be able to use a derogation, or form of exemption, when costs would be disproportionate compared with the environmental benefits, Brivio said, while respecting environmental safeguards.

The stricter limits will apply to all 2,900 large combustion plants in the EU – including coal-fired power stations and peat, oil and gas power plants – and will have to be met by 2021.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/28/trump-offshore-drilling-climate-change-environment,"President signed an executive order to review areas potentially rich in fossil fuels that were put out of reach of drilling by the Obama administration

Communities along the east coast are steeling themselves for a fresh round of angst and protest over offshore drilling, with Donald Trump set to throw open vast swaths of the Atlantic seaboard to oil and gas companies.



The climate change battle dividing Trump’s America Read more

On Friday, the president signed an executive order that asks the interior department to review offshore areas potentially rich in fossil fuels that were put out of reach of drilling by Barack Obama’s administration.

At the signing of the order, Trump said: “It’s a great day for America workers, unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high-paying American energy jobs. Our country is blessed with incredible natural resources, including abundant offshore oil and natural gas reserves.”

Asked about his first 100 days in office, which Trump has admitted has been harder than he expected, the president said: “We’re moving awfully well. We’re getting a lot of things done. We are, I don’t think there’s ever been anything like this.

“It’s a false standard, 100 days, but I have to tell you, I don’t think anybody has done what we’ve been able to do in 100 days, so we’re very happy.”

In a briefing with journalists, Ryan Zinke, the US secretary of the interior, said: “This order will cement our nation’s position as a global energy leader and foster energy security for the benefit of American people, without removing any of the stringent environmental safeguards that are currently in place.”



The review will scrutinize plots in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific that the Obama administration said would not be made available for drilling until at least 2022. In the final weeks of his presidency, Obama announced what he called a permanent ban on drilling along much of Alaska’s coast as well as the ocean floor from Virginia to Maine.

Trump is now taking the first steps to undo this, setting up a confrontation with environmentalists and residents concerned about the impact upon wildlife and the potentially ruinous economic consequences of a Deepwater Horizon-level oil spill.

Environmental groups immediately pledged to fight any repeal of protections for the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.

“Trump’s shortsighted order reverses climate progress and imperils coastal communities, irreplaceable wildlife, and our shared future,” said Trip Van Noppen, president of Earthjustice.

“It is also against the law. We will go to court to enforce the law and ensure President Obama’s protections remain in place.”

“The movement against this drilling never died, it just went into a lower gear,” said Phil Odom, a commissioner for Liberty County on Georgia’s coast. A former commercial fisherman, Odom said the “geological marvel” of Georgia’s coastline – it has 15 barrier islands and large expanses of untouched marshlands – would be in severe danger from any oil spill.

The movement against this drilling never died, it just went into a lower gear Phil Odom

“Most of the people in the coastal region do not see the necessity of it, they see what’s happened to the coastlines of Louisiana and Texas. We don’t want that.

“There are a whole lot of fishermen, hoteliers and others who will be speaking up like they did against the last administration. I have no idea if this administration will listen, but we will have to try.”

Unlike the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific coastline, there has never been commercial oil or gas drilling off the Atlantic coast. More than 120 coastal municipalities registered their horror when the Obama administration toyed with the idea of leasing out nearly 104m acres of the Atlantic, stretching from Maryland to Georgia, only to reverse course in the face of the public uproar and concern from the Pentagon over potential disturbance to military operations.

Trump, who has promised to “unleash American energy”, has already reopened the door to coalmining on federal land and pushed to speed up environmental approvals for large fossil fuel projects such as the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines. Those along the Atlantic coast fear their relatively untouched vistas will be next.

Larry Cahoon, an oceanographer at the University of North Carolina, recalled the panic that the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon spill would result in oil seeping around Florida and up the mid-Atlantic coast.

“We had people canceling vacation reservations in North Carolina because they saw a video on the news that showed the oil reaching that far,” he said. “Of course that never actually happened, the winds were all wrong, but it put people in a panic. So if we actually had a spill off this coast, it would be catastrophic for the economy here.

“We’ve benefited from the misfortunes in other states because people think our beaches are pristine, which they are. That would be severely damaged by any spill.”

The current federal offshore drilling plan rules out any drilling within 50 miles of the coast, despite the lobbying of some states to allow activity closer to shore. Cahoon said if the Trump administration relaxed the 50-mile limit it would be a “virtual certainty” that oil from a spill would stain North Carolina’s beaches.

“If they blow past that limit, there will be a firestorm of opposition,” he said. “If people start seeing oil rigs from the beach there will be severe blowback.”

The potential consequences for wildlife could be severe. North Carolina’s Cape Hattaras has an area where the the Gulf Stream current crashes into the mid-Atlantic current, a mix that supports an abundance of biodiversity – dozens of types of seabird, 20 species of marine mammals and a population of bluefin tuna, the latter being highly prized by fishermen.

'See you in court': activists ready for Trump to relax smog and drilling rules Read more

This location is also considered one of the most promising areas for natural gas and even testing the area for deposits has raised concern over the impact upon marine creatures. Whales, including the endangered North Atlantic right whale, traverse along the coast to feed and breed and they, along with dolphins and fish, rely heavily upon sound to navigate.

Seismic airgun blasting, where pulses of sound are fired at the seabed to ascertain if caches of fossil fuels lie beneath, has the potential to severely disrupt the echolocation used by these animals, scientists say. The Obama administration denied all seismic airgun permits along the Atlantic but this situation, too, may change under the new presidency.

Any new drilling is unlikely in the short term, at least. Revising the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s five-year plan would involve a lengthy, bitterly opposed process. And even if leases are made available in the Atlantic, any permit for drilling would require a separate environmental study before any approval is granted.

The economics of opening up a new frontier for oil is currently unfavorable, with a barrel of crude currently trading for under $50. The strong currents and crashing waves of the Atlantic provide a further logistical hurdle. “Compared to the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico is a lake,” said Cahoon. “Yes, you can engineer your way around that but the question would be ‘is it worth it?’”

However, the petroleum industry would still like the option to drill. Market conditions could become more favorable over the course of a lease period and an untapped oil-rich area would be highly prized.

“We’re not going to sit here and say that companies are going to want to go out and drill tomorrow in the Pacific and the Atlantic,” Erik Milito, policy director at the American Petroleum Institute, told Bloomberg News.

“It is important to keep options open for the long term, so companies can start planning for and determining where the best prospects are and then make those investments the global economy will require over time.”

Should this come to pass, environmentalists should be ready. Green groups have already begun lobbying of members of Congress as both sides of the issue start to relitigate arguments over jobs, safety and environmental protection.

“We’ve fought this before and we will fight it again,” said Nancy Pyne, a campaigner at marine conservation group Oceana. “We don’t want to industrialize our coasts and risk oil spills. I fully expect if Trump goes after the Atlantic, those same people living along the coast will go after him.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/28/big-four-banks-all-refuse-to-fund-adani-coalmine-after-westpac-rules-out-loan,"Coalition frontbencher calls for Queenslanders to boycott Australia’s second-largest bank after it says it will now only lend to mines in established coalfields

Australia’s big four banks have all ruled out funding or withdrawn from Adani’s Queensland coal project, after Westpac said it would not back opening up new coalmining regions, prompting a scathing attack from the resources minister, Matthew Canavan.

Westpac, the country’s second-largest bank, released a new climate policy on Friday, saying it would limit lending for new thermal coal projects to “only existing coal producing basins”.

The coal mined must also have energy content “in at least the top 15% globally”, meaning at least 6,300 kilocalories per kg, according to the Westpac policy.

Adani’s Carmichael mine would be the first in the Galilee basin and the coal would have only 4,950 kilocalories per kg, the miner told the Queensland land court in 2014.

Canavan, thealso the minister for northern Australia, invited Queenslanders seeking home loans or term deposits to boycott Westpac as a result of its decision.

“I can only conclude from this decision by Westpac that they are seeking to revert to their original name as the Bank of New South Wales, as they are turning their back on Queensland as a result of this decision,” he said.



“May I suggest those Queenslanders seeking a home loan or a bank deposit or some such in the next few months might want to back a bank that is backing the interests of Queenslanders.”

Canavan also accused Westpac of turning its back on “the Indigenous people of Queensland” because of majority support for the project among Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners, although this is contested by an anti-Adani faction.

The Queensland senator castigated the bank for “almost zero consultation with the people of north Queensland”, saying it was “more interested in listening to the noisy activists in Sydney than the job hungry people” in his constituency.

Adani coalmine at heightened risk of becoming a stranded asset, report says Read more

Westpac has come under pressure from environmental groups and various activist campaigns, including one that targeted its cash machines and a rally that interrupted the bank’s 200th anniversary celebrations in Sydney this month.

Adani’s final investment decision on Carmichael had been slated for this month but the company subsequently said it would be made by June before mine construction from August.

An Adani Australia spokesman said the company had not approached Westpac for funding for the mine, rail or port expansion.

But Blair Palese, the chief executive of climate advocacy group 350.org, said Westpac’s decision represented “an enormous blow to this project and the future of coal in Australia”.

Palese said the federal and Queensland governments, which both support the proposed mine, were “becoming increasingly isolated as businesses and international investors refuse to touch coal and the Adani project”.

“After months of community pressure, Westpac’s announcement is a strong indication that people everywhere are ready to stop this climate disaster in its tracks and that Adani and our government ignore them at their peril,” he said.

Adani is seeking a $1bn concessional loan from the commonwealth for its rail project linking the mine to its Abbot Point coal terminal.

On Thursday Andrew Harding, the CEO of Adani’s rival Aurizon, told the Melbourne Mining Club his company could build the line for “at least $1bn less” than Adani’s proposal, with fewer land acquisitions and less impact on the environment.

Adani wrote off that suggestion as “fanciful and monopolistic”.

Turnbull says government could subsidise gas pipelines and Adani rail Read more

“The so-called plan is a smokescreen aimed at defending Aurizon’s expensive monopoly of coal rail lines in Queensland,” Adani said. “The Aurizon plan is designed to instil fear and stifle hope in the people of regional Queensland.”

The CEO of Westpac, Brian Hartzer, also said the bank would increase its lending target for “climate change solutions” from $6.3bn to $10bn by 2020 and $25bn by 2030.

“Westpac recognises that climate change is an economic issue as well as an environmental issue, and banks have an important role to play in assisting the Australian economy to transition to a net zero emissions economy,” Hartzer said. “Limiting global warming will require a collaborative effort as we transition to lower-emissions sectors, while also taking steps to help the economy and our communities become more resilient.”

Adani previously received a $543m loan facility in two deals with Westpac, alongside others from Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank, to acquire a 99-year lease on the Abbot Point terminal, according to the climate advocacy group Market Forces.

NAB ruled out funding the Carmichael project in September 2015, a month after Commonwealth Bank parted ways with Adani as project finance adviser.

The CEO of ANZ, Shayne Elliott, in effect ruled out financing the mine last December when he predicted a downward shift in the bank’s exposure to coalmining would continue for the foreseeable future.

Critics of the Adani proposal, which would be Australia’s largest and one of the world’s largest coal mines, argue the impact of carbon emissions from its coal is incompatible with global attempts to limit warming to less than 2C.

Canavan said Adani’s target markets in India and north Asia would simply source lower quality coal with higher emissions elsewhere, a conclusion he said was shared by the Queensland supreme court in its recent rejection of a “green activist claims” against the mine.

The Adani spokesman said the company was “fervently committed” to the project “despite Westpac and other Australian financial houses choosing to ignore the opportunity to invest”.

“The financial houses have, instead, chosen to bow to environmental activists,” he said. “In so doing, they have chosen to continue to invest in overseas coal projects that will generate jobs in those countries at the expense of Australians, many of whom are their investors and depositors.”

“Mr President, start listening to the people and the scientists, not the greed of the fossil fuel industry,” Sanders said at a rally on Capitol Hill, where he was flanked by environmental advocates and two of his Democratic colleagues, Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who authored the bill, and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.

“As you all know,” the Vermont senator and former presidential candidate told the crowd, “Donald Trump is wrong about a lot of things. But there is no area where he is more wrong than on the issue of climate change.”

Sanders added: “No, Mr President, climate change is not a hoax. Climate change is real.”

At the event, held just outside the US Capitol, Sanders, Merkley and Markey unveiled legislation which seeks to completely phase out the use of fossil fuels through a transition to 100% clean and renewable energy by the middle of this century. But the bill, called the 100 by ’50 Act, is unlikely to be considered by a Republican-controlled Congress, where many GOP lawmakers are still unwilling to acknowledge the science behind global warming and contribution of human activity.

The partisan nature of the debate was not lost on the audience, as one attendee interrupted the proceedings to ask: “Where are the Republicans?”

“We’re going to have to recruit those colleagues across the aisle,” said Merkley, who ranks among the Senate’s most progressive voices. “This is not a red or a blue issue,” he said. “There is no excuse for failure. This is the biggest test facing human civilization and we have to respond and win this battle.”

Demonstrators are set to gather in Washington for the People’s Climate March on Saturday, which will also mark the 100th day of the Trump administration. Similar marches are expected in major cities across the US, as part of a broader effort to oppose Trump’s efforts to roll back the climate initiatives put in place by Barack Obama.

The president has signaled his intentions to tear up the landmark Paris climate agreement, forged by more than 195 nations in late 2015, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28% over a decade.

Trump’s top aides, who are split on whether or not the US should remain part of the Paris accord, were scheduled to meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss the deal’s future. Trump’s chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, is a vocal proponent of pulling out immediately.

Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and has already taken steps through executive action to begin the process of overturning Obama-era environmental regulations.

Among them was a directive to the EPA to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, one of Obama’s signature climate policies to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. Trump also signed an executive order that aims to unravel the Obama rule designed to protect American waterways from pollution, and proposed in his budget draconian cuts to the EPA.

At the rally, Markey said Trump’s actions were precisely why hundreds of thousands of people felt compelled to take to the streets.

“Donald Trump [is] still saying that he’s going to issue a new executive order allowing for more oil drilling on the public lands of the United States of America,” he said, drawing jeers for the president from the crowd. “That is just completely and totally unacceptable.”",guardian.com,False

Harvard University is “pausing” investments in some fossil fuel interests following a five-year campaign by some students and environment groups to pressure the university to divest itself from coal, oil and gas.

The elite university has come under fire for investing its $36bn endowment in a portfolio that contains fossil fuel companies and has until now resisted a concerted divestment campaign that has also targeted other US universities.

However, Colin Butterfield, head of natural resources at the Harvard Management Company, said that climate change is a “huge problem” and that “for now, we are pausing minerals and oil and gas.”

Butterfield said that Harvard indirectly invests in fossil fuels through outside funds, although the management company has previously signalled that it is moving away from coal due to a lack of profitability.

“What I can tell you is, from my area, I could honestly say that I doubt – I can’t say never, because never say never – but I doubt that we would ever make a direct investment with fossil fuels,” he said.

While Harvard hasn’t declared a full moratorium on fossil fuels, campaigners have hailed the pause as a breakthrough moment in the lengthy fight to get the university to divest. A group called Divest Harvard is demanding that the university freezes new investments in fossil fuels, divest from direct holdings in the top 200 publicly listed fossil fuel firms and rid themselves of all indirect ties within five years.

Protests escalated in March when students blocked the entrances to Harvard’s University Hall. In a letter to Drew Faust, Harvard’s president, Divest Harvard demanded the university act “morally and with a conscience” but an official response stated that while climate change was “one of the world’s most urgent and serious issues” it disagreed with the divestment approach.

Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate campaign group 350.org, said: “Harvard is divesting through the back door – testimony to the great pressure applied by students, faculty, and alumni, but also to its establishment unwillingness to simply say forthrightly: the fossil fuel age must end.

“Still, the significance is enormous: the richest and most famous educational institution on our planet is now siding with the future, not the past.”

The protests at Harvard were mirrored by a sit-in action at the University of Pennsylvania, where students also demanded the endowment divest from fossil fuels. Columbia University, under similar pressure, recently announced that it would divest from companies getting more than 35% of their income from thermal coal production.

Last year, Yale announced it had removed around $10m in fossil fuel investments from its $25bn endowment and Dartmouth announced a review of its holdings. Meanwhile, the board of trustees of Cornell University approved a standard that would trigger divestment in a “morally reprehensible” company without specifying a specific approach to fossil fuels.",guardian.com,False

A controversial underground coalmine that will threaten the water supply of 71 landowners in NSW’s southern highlands will net the state government just $120m over two decades, locals have been told.

A multinational steelmaker, Korea-based Posco, is seeking approval for an underground coalmine near Berrima in the southern highlands of New South Wales, part of Sydney’s drinking-water catchment.

On Wednesday night locals gathered from across the southern highlands region, in the small town of Exeter, about two hours’ south of Sydney, for a meeting with state planning officials to discuss the company’s recently released environmental impact statement.

The community is almost wholly opposed to the mine, according to surveys of locals who fear contamination of the region’s pristine aquifers, noise from increased train and truck movements, particle pollution from the coal stockpiles, and the impact on towns such as historic Berrima, one of Australia’s best-preserved examples of a Georgian village.

The chief concern, however, is the loss of bore water for the region’s farmers and landholders.

The coal is to be extracted from shallow deposits, which will cause groundwater to fill the voids and cause the drawdown of a significant number of bores. Locals were told on Wednesday it could take as long as 73 years for the full recovery of the groundwater.

The company’s environmental impact statement, released last month, revealed the mine would cause 93 groundwater bores in the region to drop by anywhere between two and 80 metres.

Seventy-one landholders will be affected.

It was also revealed on Wednesday night that the project would give the state government just $120m royalties over the 19-year life of the mine. That’s an average of about $6.3m a year in today’s dollars.

The company has offered to bring in new pumps or drill deeper bores for landholders.

But representatives from the NSW Department of Planning and Environment told locals they were concerned about the distinct lack of detail on the company’s proposed mitigation measures.

The executive director of resource assessments, David Kitto, told the crowd the mine would simply not be approved unless the company provided more detail on how it would address drops in the bore water.

“The predicted number of bores affected is 90-odd, which is very, very significant. That is a significant number compared to other mining projects in NSW,” Kitto said.

“They do say they’ll make good those impacts in the environmental impact statement, but there’s not a lot of detail on how that would happen.”

“I don’t think the government will be approving significant impacts on a lot of bores like that unless there’s a lot more detail from the company on how it would be managed.”

One local, Berrima berry farmer Bruce Robertson, is a retired supervising geologist with four decades of experiencing in coalmining. He told the meeting the company’s claims did not stack up.

“These aquifers are in the triassic sandstones and that’s why they’re so magnificent, and they don’t exist under the coal measures,” Robertson said.



“If they’re proposing to drill beneath the coal measures to actually source water, then that’s a fictitious statement,” he said.

“I can assure you, having developed mines and bore fills associated with mines, that what they’re saying is impossible to be replaced,” he said.

But Hume Coal maintains that the impact on water levels has been the “key consideration throughout the whole mine design”.

Company spokesman Ben Fitzsimmons said locals had every right to be concerned, but attributed fears about the project to a lack of understanding.

“Of course people are continuing to have this fear, because it’s simply a lack of understanding,” Fitzsimmons told Guardian Australia.

“Any impact on groundwater, the onus is on us, Hume Coal, to ensure that anyone who has access to groundwater now retains access today, tomorrow, during operations and after operations,” he said.

The company would ensure continuous access to bore water for landholders who accepted their help, he said, by drilling deeper bores and using more powerful pumps.

He said the mine site would integrate into the landscape and its visibility would be minimal and “relatively out-of-sight”.

The mine would use on-demand and infrared lighting at night to lessen any glow from the site.

Fitzsimmons also pointed to the creation of 400 construction jobs, and 300 ongoing jobs during the mine’s operation.

Another local, Ian Burns, said the mine’s low recovery rate and expensive method raised questions about its economic viability. He said it would only take a slight drop in the price of coal for the project to become unviable.

Burns, who is part of the Battle for Berrima group, fears locals may be left with a mess if the mine is approved, but then abandoned by the company due to the cost.

“It’s fraught with danger. From a financial perspective, the coal of price doesn’t have to change much and the whole thing is just uneconomic,” he said.

He said surveys showed 94% of residents in Exeter and 93.5% in Berrima were opposed to the mine.

Conservative opposition to windfarms risks the UK missing out on one of the cheapest sources of electricity, according to the head of a Shell-funded industry group.

Adair Turner, chair of the Energy Transitions Commission, said wind and solar power costs had fallen dramatically globally and urged the government to rethink its ban on subsidised onshore windfarms.

“We have to at least understand that a ban on doing onshore wind is giving up the opportunity of what is increasingly the cheapest form of electricity. I would not personally have that ban on onshore wind,” Lord Turner told the Guardian.

A report by the commission found that the cost of wind power had fallen by 60% in the past five years. The analysis predicted that by 2040, wind and solar would account for 45% of the global power mix, with hydro and nuclear making up another 35%.

“We’re basically saying by 2040, you can get the share of fossil fuel generation down to 20%, and that is quite ambitious,” said Turner. “What is distinctive is the group of people who are making that statement. It’s not just either industry or NGOs, it’s both.”

Membership of the commission, founded in 2015 to examine how energy systems can be changed to avoid dangerous global warming, includes the fossil fuel giants Shell and BHP Billiton, plus Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the investment manager Blackrock and the green thinktank the European Climate Foundation.

The group said that by 2035, wind and solar could provide 98% of power in developed countries such as Germany and the UK, with gas power stations or batteries providing backup. Nuclear would not grow its share because of cost, while progress on carbon capture and storage of emissions from coal and gas power stations had been “too slow”.

Of Donald Trump, who recently issued an executive order rolling back Barack Obama’s clean power plan, Turner said: “The Trump presidency is not good for climate change, we can’t pretend otherwise.” But he said renewable energy had such momentum in the US and globally that Trump would be unable to deliver a “fatal setback”.",guardian.com,False

Australia’s big four banks have all ruled out funding or withdrawn from Adani’s Queensland coal project, after Westpac said it would not back opening up new coalmining regions, prompting a scathing attack from the resources minister, Matthew Canavan.

Westpac, the country’s second-largest bank, released a new climate policy on Friday, saying it would limit lending for new thermal coal projects to “only existing coal producing basins”.

The coal mined must also have energy content “in at least the top 15% globally”, meaning at least 6,300 kilocalories per kg, according to the Westpac policy.

Adani’s Carmichael mine would be the first in the Galilee basin and the coal would have only 4,950 kilocalories per kg, the miner told the Queensland land court in 2014.

Canavan, thealso the minister for northern Australia, invited Queenslanders seeking home loans or term deposits to boycott Westpac as a result of its decision.

“I can only conclude from this decision by Westpac that they are seeking to revert to their original name as the Bank of New South Wales, as they are turning their back on Queensland as a result of this decision,” he said.



“May I suggest those Queenslanders seeking a home loan or a bank deposit or some such in the next few months might want to back a bank that is backing the interests of Queenslanders.”

Canavan also accused Westpac of turning its back on “the Indigenous people of Queensland” because of majority support for the project among Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners, although this is contested by an anti-Adani faction.

The Queensland senator castigated the bank for “almost zero consultation with the people of north Queensland”, saying it was “more interested in listening to the noisy activists in Sydney than the job hungry people” in his constituency.

Westpac has come under pressure from environmental groups and various activist campaigns, including one that targeted its cash machines and a rally that interrupted the bank’s 200th anniversary celebrations in Sydney this month.

Adani’s final investment decision on Carmichael had been slated for this month but the company subsequently said it would be made by June before mine construction from August.

An Adani Australia spokesman said the company had not approached Westpac for funding for the mine, rail or port expansion.

But Blair Palese, the chief executive of climate advocacy group 350.org, said Westpac’s decision represented “an enormous blow to this project and the future of coal in Australia”.

Palese said the federal and Queensland governments, which both support the proposed mine, were “becoming increasingly isolated as businesses and international investors refuse to touch coal and the Adani project”.

“After months of community pressure, Westpac’s announcement is a strong indication that people everywhere are ready to stop this climate disaster in its tracks and that Adani and our government ignore them at their peril,” he said.

Adani is seeking a $1bn concessional loan from the commonwealth for its rail project linking the mine to its Abbot Point coal terminal.

On Thursday Andrew Harding, the CEO of Adani’s rival Aurizon, told the Melbourne Mining Club his company could build the line for “at least $1bn less” than Adani’s proposal, with fewer land acquisitions and less impact on the environment.

Adani wrote off that suggestion as “fanciful and monopolistic”.

“The so-called plan is a smokescreen aimed at defending Aurizon’s expensive monopoly of coal rail lines in Queensland,” Adani said. “The Aurizon plan is designed to instil fear and stifle hope in the people of regional Queensland.”

The CEO of Westpac, Brian Hartzer, also said the bank would increase its lending target for “climate change solutions” from $6.3bn to $10bn by 2020 and $25bn by 2030.

“Westpac recognises that climate change is an economic issue as well as an environmental issue, and banks have an important role to play in assisting the Australian economy to transition to a net zero emissions economy,” Hartzer said. “Limiting global warming will require a collaborative effort as we transition to lower-emissions sectors, while also taking steps to help the economy and our communities become more resilient.”

Adani previously received a $543m loan facility in two deals with Westpac, alongside others from Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank, to acquire a 99-year lease on the Abbot Point terminal, according to the climate advocacy group Market Forces.

NAB ruled out funding the Carmichael project in September 2015, a month after Commonwealth Bank parted ways with Adani as project finance adviser.

The CEO of ANZ, Shayne Elliott, in effect ruled out financing the mine last December when he predicted a downward shift in the bank’s exposure to coalmining would continue for the foreseeable future.

Critics of the Adani proposal, which would be Australia’s largest and one of the world’s largest coal mines, argue the impact of carbon emissions from its coal is incompatible with global attempts to limit warming to less than 2C.

Canavan said Adani’s target markets in India and north Asia would simply source lower quality coal with higher emissions elsewhere, a conclusion he said was shared by the Queensland supreme court in its recent rejection of a “green activist claims” against the mine.

The Adani spokesman said the company was “fervently committed” to the project “despite Westpac and other Australian financial houses choosing to ignore the opportunity to invest”.

“The financial houses have, instead, chosen to bow to environmental activists,” he said. “In so doing, they have chosen to continue to invest in overseas coal projects that will generate jobs in those countries at the expense of Australians, many of whom are their investors and depositors.”

The Carmichael coal “easily meets the emissions standards announced by Westpac”, the spokesman said.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/27/bernie-sanders-fossil-fuel-plan-2050,"As protesters prepare for nationwide demonstrations against Donald Trump’s environmental agenda, Bernie Sanders on Thursday backed legislation that would phase out the use of fossil fuels in the US by 2050.

“Mr President, start listening to the people and the scientists, not the greed of the fossil fuel industry,” Sanders said at a rally on Capitol Hill, where he was flanked by environmental advocates and two of his Democratic colleagues, Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who authored the bill, and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.

The Republicans who care about climate change: 'They are done with the denial' Read more

“As you all know,” the Vermont senator and former presidential candidate told the crowd, “Donald Trump is wrong about a lot of things. But there is no area where he is more wrong than on the issue of climate change.”

Sanders added: “No, Mr President, climate change is not a hoax. Climate change is real.”

At the event, held just outside the US Capitol, Sanders, Merkley and Markey unveiled legislation which seeks to completely phase out the use of fossil fuels through a transition to 100% clean and renewable energy by the middle of this century. But the bill, called the 100 by ’50 Act, is unlikely to be considered by a Republican-controlled Congress, where many GOP lawmakers are still unwilling to acknowledge the science behind global warming and contribution of human activity.

The partisan nature of the debate was not lost on the audience, as one attendee interrupted the proceedings to ask: “Where are the Republicans?”

“We’re going to have to recruit those colleagues across the aisle,” said Merkley, who ranks among the Senate’s most progressive voices. “This is not a red or a blue issue,” he said. “There is no excuse for failure. This is the biggest test facing human civilization and we have to respond and win this battle.”

Demonstrators are set to gather in Washington for the People’s Climate March on Saturday, which will also mark the 100th day of the Trump administration. Similar marches are expected in major cities across the US, as part of a broader effort to oppose Trump’s efforts to roll back the climate initiatives put in place by Barack Obama.

The president has signaled his intentions to tear up the landmark Paris climate agreement, forged by more than 195 nations in late 2015, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28% over a decade.

Trump’s top aides, who are split on whether or not the US should remain part of the Paris accord, were scheduled to meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss the deal’s future. Trump’s chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, is a vocal proponent of pulling out immediately.

Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and has already taken steps through executive action to begin the process of overturning Obama-era environmental regulations.

Among them was a directive to the EPA to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, one of Obama’s signature climate policies to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. Trump also signed an executive order that aims to unravel the Obama rule designed to protect American waterways from pollution, and proposed in his budget draconian cuts to the EPA.

At the rally, Markey said Trump’s actions were precisely why hundreds of thousands of people felt compelled to take to the streets.

“Donald Trump [is] still saying that he’s going to issue a new executive order allowing for more oil drilling on the public lands of the United States of America,” he said, drawing jeers for the president from the crowd. “That is just completely and totally unacceptable.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/27/harvard-university-pausing-investments-in-some-fossil-fuels,"University stops short of fully divesting its $36bn endowment from coal, oil and gas but green groups welcome the breakthrough after a five-year campaign

Harvard University is “pausing” investments in some fossil fuel interests following a five-year campaign by some students and environment groups to pressure the university to divest itself from coal, oil and gas.

The elite university has come under fire for investing its $36bn endowment in a portfolio that contains fossil fuel companies and has until now resisted a concerted divestment campaign that has also targeted other US universities.

However, Colin Butterfield, head of natural resources at the Harvard Management Company, said that climate change is a “huge problem” and that “for now, we are pausing minerals and oil and gas.”

Butterfield said that Harvard indirectly invests in fossil fuels through outside funds, although the management company has previously signalled that it is moving away from coal due to a lack of profitability.

“What I can tell you is, from my area, I could honestly say that I doubt – I can’t say never, because never say never – but I doubt that we would ever make a direct investment with fossil fuels,” he said.

While Harvard hasn’t declared a full moratorium on fossil fuels, campaigners have hailed the pause as a breakthrough moment in the lengthy fight to get the university to divest. A group called Divest Harvard is demanding that the university freezes new investments in fossil fuels, divest from direct holdings in the top 200 publicly listed fossil fuel firms and rid themselves of all indirect ties within five years.

Protests escalated in March when students blocked the entrances to Harvard’s University Hall. In a letter to Drew Faust, Harvard’s president, Divest Harvard demanded the university act “morally and with a conscience” but an official response stated that while climate change was “one of the world’s most urgent and serious issues” it disagreed with the divestment approach.

Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate campaign group 350.org, said: “Harvard is divesting through the back door – testimony to the great pressure applied by students, faculty, and alumni, but also to its establishment unwillingness to simply say forthrightly: the fossil fuel age must end.

“Still, the significance is enormous: the richest and most famous educational institution on our planet is now siding with the future, not the past.”

The protests at Harvard were mirrored by a sit-in action at the University of Pennsylvania, where students also demanded the endowment divest from fossil fuels. Columbia University, under similar pressure, recently announced that it would divest from companies getting more than 35% of their income from thermal coal production.

Last year, Yale announced it had removed around $10m in fossil fuel investments from its $25bn endowment and Dartmouth announced a review of its holdings. Meanwhile, the board of trustees of Cornell University approved a standard that would trigger divestment in a “morally reprehensible” company without specifying a specific approach to fossil fuels.",guardian.com,False

A controversial underground coalmine that will threaten the water supply of 71 landowners in NSW’s southern highlands will net the state government just $120m over two decades, locals have been told.

A multinational steelmaker, Korea-based Posco, is seeking approval for an underground coalmine near Berrima in the southern highlands of New South Wales, part of Sydney’s drinking-water catchment.

On Wednesday night locals gathered from across the southern highlands region, in the small town of Exeter, about two hours’ south of Sydney, for a meeting with state planning officials to discuss the company’s recently released environmental impact statement.

The community is almost wholly opposed to the mine, according to surveys of locals who fear contamination of the region’s pristine aquifers, noise from increased train and truck movements, particle pollution from the coal stockpiles, and the impact on towns such as historic Berrima, one of Australia’s best-preserved examples of a Georgian village.

The chief concern, however, is the loss of bore water for the region’s farmers and landholders.

The coal is to be extracted from shallow deposits, which will cause groundwater to fill the voids and cause the drawdown of a significant number of bores. Locals were told on Wednesday it could take as long as 73 years for the full recovery of the groundwater.

The company’s environmental impact statement, released last month, revealed the mine would cause 93 groundwater bores in the region to drop by anywhere between two and 80 metres.

Seventy-one landholders will be affected.

It was also revealed on Wednesday night that the project would give the state government just $120m royalties over the 19-year life of the mine. That’s an average of about $6.3m a year in today’s dollars.

The company has offered to bring in new pumps or drill deeper bores for landholders.

But representatives from the NSW Department of Planning and Environment told locals they were concerned about the distinct lack of detail on the company’s proposed mitigation measures.

The executive director of resource assessments, David Kitto, told the crowd the mine would simply not be approved unless the company provided more detail on how it would address drops in the bore water.

“The predicted number of bores affected is 90-odd, which is very, very significant. That is a significant number compared to other mining projects in NSW,” Kitto said.

“They do say they’ll make good those impacts in the environmental impact statement, but there’s not a lot of detail on how that would happen.”

“I don’t think the government will be approving significant impacts on a lot of bores like that unless there’s a lot more detail from the company on how it would be managed.”

One local, Berrima berry farmer Bruce Robertson, is a retired supervising geologist with four decades of experiencing in coalmining. He told the meeting the company’s claims did not stack up.

“These aquifers are in the triassic sandstones and that’s why they’re so magnificent, and they don’t exist under the coal measures,” Robertson said.



“If they’re proposing to drill beneath the coal measures to actually source water, then that’s a fictitious statement,” he said.

“I can assure you, having developed mines and bore fills associated with mines, that what they’re saying is impossible to be replaced,” he said.

But Hume Coal maintains that the impact on water levels has been the “key consideration throughout the whole mine design”.

Company spokesman Ben Fitzsimmons said locals had every right to be concerned, but attributed fears about the project to a lack of understanding.

“Of course people are continuing to have this fear, because it’s simply a lack of understanding,” Fitzsimmons told Guardian Australia.

“Any impact on groundwater, the onus is on us, Hume Coal, to ensure that anyone who has access to groundwater now retains access today, tomorrow, during operations and after operations,” he said.

The company would ensure continuous access to bore water for landholders who accepted their help, he said, by drilling deeper bores and using more powerful pumps.

He said the mine site would integrate into the landscape and its visibility would be minimal and “relatively out-of-sight”.

The mine would use on-demand and infrared lighting at night to lessen any glow from the site.

Fitzsimmons also pointed to the creation of 400 construction jobs, and 300 ongoing jobs during the mine’s operation.

Another local, Ian Burns, said the mine’s low recovery rate and expensive method raised questions about its economic viability. He said it would only take a slight drop in the price of coal for the project to become unviable.

Burns, who is part of the Battle for Berrima group, fears locals may be left with a mess if the mine is approved, but then abandoned by the company due to the cost.

“It’s fraught with danger. From a financial perspective, the coal of price doesn’t have to change much and the whole thing is just uneconomic,” he said.

He said surveys showed 94% of residents in Exeter and 93.5% in Berrima were opposed to the mine.

Conservative opposition to windfarms risks the UK missing out on one of the cheapest sources of electricity, according to the head of a Shell-funded industry group.

Adair Turner, chair of the Energy Transitions Commission, said wind and solar power costs had fallen dramatically globally and urged the government to rethink its ban on subsidised onshore windfarms.

“We have to at least understand that a ban on doing onshore wind is giving up the opportunity of what is increasingly the cheapest form of electricity. I would not personally have that ban on onshore wind,” Lord Turner told the Guardian.

A report by the commission found that the cost of wind power had fallen by 60% in the past five years. The analysis predicted that by 2040, wind and solar would account for 45% of the global power mix, with hydro and nuclear making up another 35%.

“We’re basically saying by 2040, you can get the share of fossil fuel generation down to 20%, and that is quite ambitious,” said Turner. “What is distinctive is the group of people who are making that statement. It’s not just either industry or NGOs, it’s both.”

Membership of the commission, founded in 2015 to examine how energy systems can be changed to avoid dangerous global warming, includes the fossil fuel giants Shell and BHP Billiton, plus Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the investment manager Blackrock and the green thinktank the European Climate Foundation.

The group said that by 2035, wind and solar could provide 98% of power in developed countries such as Germany and the UK, with gas power stations or batteries providing backup. Nuclear would not grow its share because of cost, while progress on carbon capture and storage of emissions from coal and gas power stations had been “too slow”.

Of Donald Trump, who recently issued an executive order rolling back Barack Obama’s clean power plan, Turner said: “The Trump presidency is not good for climate change, we can’t pretend otherwise.” But he said renewable energy had such momentum in the US and globally that Trump would be unable to deliver a “fatal setback”.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/29/recycle-nespresso-coffee-pods-london,"Coffee company Nespresso – part of Swiss multinational Nestlé – is to trial a scheme for consumers to recycle their used aluminium capsules for the first time in the UK, in the face of a growing environmental backlash against increasingly popular single-serve pods, many of which end up in landfill.

A six-month pilot, starting this week in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, will allow Nespresso Club members to recycle their used capsules through their council household recycling service, using special purple bags provided by the company. The borough’s 190,000 residents will only be able to put out capsules made by Nespresso.

Most other capsules on the market are not made of aluminium, usually consisting of mixed plastic and sometimes foil, which require different recycling processes. The dregs of leftover coffee remaining in the pod also make them difficult to process in standard municipal recycling plants. Nespresso has defended its use of aluminium, saying it helps keep the coffee fresh.

The company said it was responding to its users, who have requested more convenient recycling through their local council-run scheme. The trial is part of a project to give customers more convenient recycling options.

“We launched our own dedicated recycling services seven years ago,” said Francisco Nogueira, managing director of Nespresso UK and Ireland. “Every week we are seeing an increase in the volume of capsules being sent in by customers through our system. But we know there is still much to be done and recycling through the municipal system is something our members have asked for.”

The bags of aluminium capsules will be sent to Nespresso’s recycling facility in Congleton, while the waste coffee grounds will be extracted and turned into compost. Nespresso capsules are included in other national recycling schemes such as the Green Dot programme in Germany as well as in a number of other countries, including France and Canada. But in the German city of Hamburg coffee capsules have been banned from state-run buildings as part of a drive to cut waste.

Nespresso introduced the first single-serve coffee machine in 1986, initially using only its own-brand pods. But after Nespresso’s patents began to expire in 2012, competitors started to offer capsules and machines compatible with the Nespresso system.

Nestle would not say what proportion of its capsules are recycled, instead focusing on its recycling “capacity” – which it says is 100%. Market research company Mintel estimated the UK coffee pods market to be worth £182m in 2016 in its most recent study, up from £158m in 2015, and forecast to reach £206m this year. According to their research, 29% of Britons own a coffee pod machine.

The move was welcomed by Trewin Restorick, chief executive of environmental charity Hubbub, who said: “Nespresso pods are mainly aluminium and can be recycled whereas many of their competitors’ pods are mixed plastic which currently can’t be recycled. But using aluminium only makes sense from a resource point of view if the discarded aluminium is recycled, otherwise it is a very carbon intensive way for consumers to get their coffee. Nespresso needs to scale up the recycling process quickly.”

The company’s long-term ambition, a Nespresso spokeswoman said, was to enable more recycling of used capsules via council collection services.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/29/mps-demand-action-on-10bn-food-waste,"Supermarket “best before” labels could be phased out while shops should be forced to sell oddly shaped vegetables under proposals from MPs who have warned the government it needs to do more to tackle food waste.

More than £10bn worth of food is thrown away by households each year, according to a damning report from the environment, food and rural affairs select committee.

The committee, whose report Food Waste in England is published on Sunday, said the government should set an “ambitious” national reduction target to cut food waste, which costs the average person £200 a year. Raising awareness of food waste from a young age should be a priority and the government should examine how lessons on food and avoiding waste can be incorporated into the school curriculum, they said.

“Socially, it is a scandal that people are going hungry and using food banks when so much produce is being wasted,” said Neil Parish, chair of the committee. “And environmentally it is a disaster, because energy and resources are wasted in production only for the food to end up rotting in landfills where it produces methane – a potent climate-changing gas.”

The report says supermarkets should be forced to publish data on the amount of food they bin. The MPs commended Tesco for already publishing this information and praised Sainsbury’s for moving in the same direction. However, they said retailers should increase the amount of surplus food they give away to charities – instead of binning so much – and should also improve their packaging, for example by using more resealable packets.

In addition, the incoming government has been urged to continue with a review on food date labelling, looking particularly at whether there is a need for “best before” dates which can confuse people.

The committee expressed its dismay at the trend for supermarkets to sell only perfectly shaped vegetables and fruit. “It’s ridiculous that perfectly good vegetables are wasted simply because they’re a funny shape,” said Parish. “Farmers supplying fruits and vegetables to UK supermarkets currently get their produce rejected on the grounds that it fails to meet cosmetic quality standards set by the big retailers. Knobbly carrots and parsnips don’t cook or taste any different. It’s high time we saved them from the supermarket reject bins.”

Parish said the government should set a national target for food waste reduction in England, as Scotland, the US and European countries do. It was also essential that waste reduction body Wrap, which has seen its funding cut despite its success in reducing food waste through voluntary agreements, has sufficient money to maintain its efforts, he said.",guardian.com,False

Scientists are finalising plans to make a last-ditch attempt to save the world’s most endangered marine mammal, the vaquita porpoise. They believe there are now fewer than 30 of these distinctive cetaceans left in the Gulf of California.

Only by catching the remaining creatures and protecting them in a sanctuary can the vaquita be saved, it is argued.

Saved: the endangered species back from the brink of extinction Read more

The $4m (£3m) rescue plan will involve conservationists patrolling the gulf with the help of dolphins trained by the US navy to pinpoint other cetaceans. The idea is that the animals will then be captured and transported to a sanctuary in San Felipe, Mexico.

But the attempt carries risks. No one has every tried to capture, transport or care for a vaquita before and scientists do not know how they will react.

“Some porpoises, like the harbour porpoise, don’t seem to mind too much when captured, but others, such as the Dall’s porpoise, go into shock,” said Barbara Taylor, of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). “We don’t know which it is going to be. It is a nerve-racking prospect.”

However, scientists insist they now have no choice. “Vaquita numbers are so low it is clear that if we do nothing it will go extinct very soon,” said Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho, of Mexico’s National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change.

“However, if we capture the last few and try to protect them we have a chance to save the species.”

The vaquita, Phocoena sinus, is small, reaching a maximum length of only 5ft (1.5 metres), and has a grey back and white belly. Its home territory – a 900 sq mile section of the northern Gulf of California – is the smallest occupied by a whale species.

Twenty years ago, there were about 600 in the region. However, the population has since crashed as a result of illegal fishing of a species called the totoaba. Flesh from its swim bladder can fetch prices of more than $100,000 (£77,000) per kilogramme in China, where it is prized for its medicinal properties. “Quite simply, it commands a higher price than cocaine,” said Rojas-Bracho.

The gill nets designed to catch totoaba are also the perfect size for capturing vaquitas, which get tangled and drown. The Mexican government has recently tightened its laws against illegal fishing, but the rewards for totoaba catches are so high there has been little respite and vaquita numbers have continued to plummet.

“The population dropped to 30 last year, but there have been more deaths so I expect we’ll lose about half of this number this year,” said Taylor, a member of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita . “At this rate it will not last much longer. That is why our task is so urgent.”

As part of the rescue project – which has received $3m backing from the Mexican government and $1m from the US Association of Zoos and Aquariums – researchers will use acoustic sensors over the next few months to find the vaquitas and then, in October, they will try to catch individual specimens in nets.

“We plan to use a couple of trained dolphins to help us,” said Taylor. “It remains to be seen how effective they will be.”

Once the vaquitas are caught, they will be carried to floating pens and – if they respond to the ordeal in a relatively stress-free manner – they will be taken to a sanctuary being built in San Felipe.

“Ultimately, we would like to begin a captive breeding programme with the aim of restoring numbers and finally returning vaquitas to the wild, although we obviously cannot do that until we have dealt with the problems that are causing them to be wiped out at present,” said Taylor.

Ten years ago Taylor was involved in an attempt to survey numbers of a similar cetacean, the Yangtze river dolphin – also known as the baiji. Its population was known to be threatened by the illegal laying of fishing nets.

What Taylor’s team found turned out to be far worse. “We didn’t see a single baiji or hear one whistle,” she told the Observer. “We were too late.” The baiji is now officially listed as extinct.

“I resolved then that the vaquita would not suffer a similar fate,” Taylor said – although she accepts the recent dramatic decline in its numbers puts it in a very perilous position.

“It is always risky taking an animal into captivity, especially one with which we have no previous experience and who are made up of the last few individuals of that species. But we have to do this.”

In the past, other species have been pulled back from the brink of extinction, Rojas-Bracho said. Hunting had reduced numbers of the northern elephant seal to a few dozen in the 19th century.

Today, protected by law, there are more than 170,000 of them. “A similar story concerns the southern sea otter, which was reduced in number to about 50 but which has since bounced back to around 2,500 creatures,” he said. “This sort of thing can be done.

“Certainly, we are not where we would want to be when it comes to saving the vaquita – but we have to do our best or it will be lost to the planet for ever.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/29/ny-times-hired-a-hippe-puncher-to-give-climate-obstructionists-cover,"Bret Stephens’ first piece for the Times showed exactly why some climate realists are canceling their subscriptions

Yesterday, New York Times subscribers were treated to an email alert announcing the first opinion column from Bret Stephens, who they hired away from the Wall Street Journal. Like all Journal opinion columnists who write about climate change, Stephens has said a lot of things on the subject that could charitably be described as ignorant and wrong. Thus many Times subscribers voiced bewilderment and concern about his hiring, to which the paper’s public editor issued a rather offensive response.

Justifying the critics, here’s how the paper announced Stephens’ first opinion column in an email alert (usually reserved for important breaking news):

TOP STORIES In his debut as a Times Op-Ed columnist, Bret Stephens says reasonable people can be skeptical about the dangers of climate change

Stephens gets his few facts wrong

In his column, Stephens pooh-poohed climate change as a “modest (0.85 degrees Celsius) warming of the Northern Hemisphere since 1880,” citing the 2014 IPCC report. However, Stephens packed three big mistakes into that single sentence. Here’s what the IPCC said (emphasis added):

The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C over the period 1880 to 2012

The northern hemisphere warms faster than the global average because it has more land and less ocean than the southern hemisphere (water warms slowly), so this is an important mistake that underestimates the global temperature rise. On top of that, since 2012 we’ve seen the three hottest years on record (2014, 2015, and 2016), so even the 0.85°C warming figure is outdated (it’s now right around 1°C).

Stephens doesn’t understand the rapid pace or urgency of the problem

Most importantly, the global warming we’ve experience is in no way “modest.” We’re already causing a rate of warming faster than when the Earth transitions out of an ice age, and within a few decades we could be causing the fastest climate change Earth has seen in 50 million years. The last ice age transition saw about 4°C global warming over 10,000 years; humans are on pace to cause that much warming between 1900 and 2100 – a period of just 200 years, with most of that warming happening since 1975.

Of course, how much global warming we see in the coming decades depends on how much carbon pollution we dump into the atmosphere. If we take serious immediate action to cut those emissions, as the international community pledged to do under the Paris agreement, we can limit global warming to perhaps 2°C, and the climate consequences that come along with it.

But this is where Stephens’ opinions are particularly unhelpful:

Demanding abrupt and expensive changes in public policy raises fair questions about ideological intentions. Censoriously asserting one’s moral superiority and treating skeptics as imbeciles and deplorables wins few converts … Perhaps if there were less certitude about our climate future, more Americans would be interested in having a reasoned conversation about it.

In other words, the people obstructing climate policies are justified because climate “advocates” are too mean to them, and claim too much certainty about the future.

This is of course nonsense. There is uncertainty about how much global warming and climate change we’ll see in the coming decades (climate scientists are crystal clear about this), but the biggest factor contributing to that uncertainty is human behavior – how much carbon pollution we end up dumping into the atmosphere. This is apparent from looking at the IPCC global temperature projections:

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Global average surface temperature projections. Illustration: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report.

In the red ‘burn lots of fossil fuels’ (RCP8.5) scenario, we’ll see a further 3.0–5.5°C warming between now and 2100. In the blue ‘take immediate serious climate action’ (RCP2.6) scenario, we’ll see a further 0.5–1.5°C global warming by 2100. Those ranges represent uncertainties in the climate modeling, but the difference between them – which is based on how much carbon pollution we release – is bigger than the uncertainty in each scenario.

Stephens needs a lesson in risk management

Smoking provides an apt analogy. Each time we smoke, we increase the odds of developing cancer a little bit more. The future outcome is uncertain – we don’t know exactly if or when the disaster of cancer will hit – but we know we’re making it more likely every time we smoke, and the smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on the cigarettes as quickly as possible. With climate change, each time we add more carbon pollution to the atmosphere, we increase the odds of a climate catastrophe a little bit more. The smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on our burning of fossil fuels as quickly as possible.

Stephens’ piece is akin to criticizing doctors and anti-smoking groups for being too mean to the tobacco industry, and for not focusing on the uncertainty about exactly when the chain-smoking patient will develop cancer.

So far, climate change may be humanity’s greatest-ever risk management failure. The Paris climate agreement was a major step to remedy that failure, but now the Trump administration is debating whether to withdraw from it, or simply refuse to honor America’s pledges.



There have been bipartisan bills in Congress to implement market-based solutions to the problem, but each has been blocked by the Republican Party at the behest of its fossil fuel donors. Democrats have even proposed small government, revenue-neutral solutions that would benefit the economy, but while some Republican elder statesmen support the policy, Republicans in Congress have refused to even vote on it.

Stephens punches the hippies



In short, on climate science and policy it’s clear where the problem lies, and it’s not with the advocates. Not only does Stephens get basic facts wrong and gloss over the tremendous risks posed by climate change, but he blames partisan policy obstruction on the people who are desperately trying every possible avenue to solve the problem. The New York Times is publishing and promoting textbook hippie punching, and its readers are rightly appalled.

A number of climate realists and scientists have canceled their subscriptions to the paper in response. It’s a difficult choice because New York Times journalists do a lot of good reporting, including on climate change. Justin Gillis is practically a national treasure. In fact many of those Times journalists themselves seem unhappy about the hire and Stephens’ first opinion piece.

Tom Wright-Piersanti (@tomwp) ""The New York Times newsroom and the New York Times opinion section are totally separate things!"" he shouted into the void

At the same time, it’s difficult to stomach paying for a paper that uses that money to hire and promote views as uninformed and harmful as Bret Stephens’, on a subject as critically important as climate change.



Personally, I had hoped that Stephens would simply avoid the subject, but his first piece dashed those hopes much in the way that our hopes for sensible American climate policy have been dashed time and time again by those who he defends.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2017/apr/28/the-crew-of-cyclists-turning-floridas-lawns-into-farms,"The future of the immaculate British lawn is under threat, claims a new report from the Royal Horticultural Society: rising temperatures will deliver a triple-threat of dryness, weeds and pests that gardeners will have to navigate if they want to maintain their manicured emerald rectangles. Some reports have even suggested we do away with lawns altogether and just substitute them with fake green turf (gasp!) to avoid the inevitable hassle.

But will it be worth it? Let’s be honest, what do lawns really do, anyway—other than satisfy that odd part of the human ego that thrives off the sight of evenly-clipped grass? In fact, how about we really shake things up and just turn our lawns into vegetable patches, instead?

That’s the idea behind Fleet Farming, a group of amateur farmers in Florida who are slowly transforming people’s lawns into food gardens in the city of Orlando. “Land is scarce and it’s expensive, but in America we have more than 40 million acres of lawn,” says co-founder Chris Castro, who is also Orlando city’s sustainability director. “So that’s an enormous amount of food that potentially could be grown.”

Their approach is simple. Homeowners contact Fleet Farming (or vice versa) and offer up their lawns for conversion. They have to show that the land has been pesticide-free for two years before they can turn it over. A suggested donation of $500 covers the start-up costs—though it’s not obligatory, and homeowners can pay in instalments if they wish. Then the organisation orchestrates a ‘Swarm Ride’, in which volunteers cycle en masse to the plot, where they till the soil, plant seeds, and care for the farm.

At harvest time, a portion of the produce goes straight to the homeowner, and the rest is distributed via neighbourhood markets and local restaurants into the surrounding community. This system of farming and sale has allowed the organisation to be financially self-sustaining, Castro says.

So far, they’ve transformed 21 Orlando lawns into ‘farmlettes’, with a handful of others sprouting up also in Jacksonville Florida, and in California.

A project of environmental solutions incubator IDEAS for Us, Fleet Farming is founded on the concepts of urban farming, and inspired by the pioneering movement for ‘Food Not Lawns’. But what makes it unique, Castro claims, is that it integrates all the major components of a food system at the neighbourhood scale. Fleet Farming wants to build an agricultural system “within neighbourhoods, not just within cities, to do it by bicycle, and at the same time empower the community to help build, maintain, process, and sell goods to local restaurants and farmers markets.” It’s what Castro calls “a hyper-local solution.”

The particular problem they’re trying to help solve extends well beyond the scope of urban farm plots. “Food systems are incredibly unsustainable,” Castro says. “We’re transporting our food 1,500 to 1,800 miles per person, per plate, per day. And in addition, we’ve seen that almost a third of global emissions is coming from the industrial agricultural complex.” Fleet Farming sees its smallscale land-use changes as a way to help steer agriculture towards a decentralised, localised and lower-impact future. “The heart of what we’re trying to accomplish is a zero-carbon agricultural program,” Castro says.

It’s also giving lawns an eco-conscious makeover. In a 2005 study, researcher Cristina Milesi worked with Nasa scientists to reveal, using remote sensing, that lawns in America cover an estimated 40 million acres. In another study, Milesi then calculated that there’s a potential 16 to 23 millions acres of irrigated lawn, specifically, in the US. “That puts irrigated lawn area next to, or just behind, irrigated corn area,” says Milesi, who is now the scientific director at the Institute for Public Health and the Environment in Palo Alto, California.

The disadvantage, of course, is that these blank green spaces don’t produce any food. Add to that the plethora of pesticides showered onto lawns, which can seep into soil and water systems, and the expulsion of biodiversity as the grass monocrop replaces flowers, shrubs, and trees.

On Fleet Farm plots, these problems are replaced with rows of vegetables: kale, cabbage, radishes, potatoes, spinach, cowpeas, and pumpkins now carpet former lawns.

Arguably, the initiative is better suited to the many-lawned neighbourhoods of suburbia, rather than the inner-city environments that would probably benefit the most from its promise of food security. “One thing that worries me is that in the largest inner cities there are not that many lawns to be replaced,” says Milesi, who however applauds the effort and thinks that the vacant lots that pepper high-density urban areas could instead be repurposed as farms.

The organisation is also taking concerted measures to extend beyond the bounds of trendy urban farming utopia, into lower-income neighbourhoods where the lack of fresh produce creates food deserts.

Recently, they got a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to set up farms in Florida’s low-income Parramore neighbourhood, along with a local farmers’ market so that produce gets directly to residents. They’re trying to forge a different path to many other organisations who have historically been weak on community engagement, and watched their efforts fizzle out as a result, says Lee Perry, Fleet Farming’s director.

By working alongside local neighbourhood businesses, churches, and non-profits, “our organization aims to rally people together before the construction of their first farmlettes,” she says. The idea is that this helps to weave it into the fabric of a neighbourhood, after which fleets of local volunteers will provide the momentum to keep the project alive.

With fewer than 50 lawns converted, Fleet Farming is still working at a relatively small scale, planning to build up gradually to create a sustainable, self-supporting network of neighbourhood farms, says Castro.

But people are eager to see it spread: in Orlando alone, there’s already a waiting list of more than 400 people who want to volunteer their lawns. “In fact, 724 communities have signed up to branch Fleet Farming into 20 other countries,” Castro says. “We’re seeing this as a global opportunity.”",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/apr/27/new-study-global-warming-keeps-on-keeping-on,"As humans continue to dump heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the Earth continues to warm. In fact, it has been warming for decades and we now routinely hit temperatures that are 1°C (about 2°F) above the temperatures from 100 years ago.

But despite what we may expect, temperatures across the globe don’t rise little by little each year in a straight line. Rather, temperature changes are a bit bumpy. They go up and they go down somewhat randomly as they increase. Think of a wiggly line superimposed on a straight rising line.



A great depiction of the behavior is seen from the NASA data, shown below. Each black mark is the Earth’s temperature for a given year. The red line is calculated from 5-year averages of the black data marks and is much smoother than the black line. As you move from left to right, you pass from the year 1880 to the most recent year (2016), which is shown in the very upper right corner.

Careful observation of the graph shows that the last three years (2014, 2015, and 2016) were all record-breakers. It makes you wonder, what the chances are that global warming has sped up?

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Annual global average surface temperatures with a 5-year smoothing. Illustration: NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies

Well this is a question that can be tested with statistics, and a new paper out in Environmental Research Letters did just that. In the study, the authors ask a few important questions. First, can the latest three years, all of which were record-setting, tell us whether the rate of warming has changed? Also, can the years that preceded those (which were cooler than the trend) tell us whether the rate of warming had slowed?

With respect to whether surface warming has sped up or slowed down, the authors of this study made a testable hypothesis. They started out assuming that the Earth was warming at a constant rate but superimposed on this warming was a random short-term variability. Then they looked at the temperature measurements (like those shown in the figure above) and ran statistical tests to see whether those temperatures would be unlikely to occur given their hypothesis. A simple way to state this is, do you get temperature results like that above with the simple assumption of constant warming with natural year-to-year fluctuations?

Using what is called a Monte Carlo method where you let your statistics tool give you a large population of possible temperatures by running many random trials, the authors found that using the NASA temperatures, the likelihood of seeing a trend as low as, or even lower than what was observed during the 2001–2014 period was 74%. The likelihood of seeing the actual 2000–2012 temperatures was 96%. In other words, it’s very likely that a time period with a trend as low as observed would occur just by chance, given a constant warming rate.

They repeated the analysis for another climate dataset (HadCRUT4) and found again, it’s not unusual to expect the temperatures we actually saw over these periods. The figure below shows five different sets of temperature data; they are all telling this same story of uninterrupted rise over the past four decades or so.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trends in global temperatures, using a a change-point analysis for five different data sets. Illustration: Rahmstorf et al. (2017), Environmental Research Letters

What was incredibly powerful is that the authors show that it would have been statistically significant to have not found an interval with as a slow warming as actually measured.



What this analysis shows us is that the Earth continues to warm apace. Furthermore, we shouldn’t get excited about any given year that is cold or warm, or think it’s showing that global warming is slowing down or speeding up. Rather, this paper reminds us that long-term trends are what matters. And the long-term trends are speaking loudly. This latest study is just another nail in the coffin of the lie that global warming ended.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2017/apr/27/look-no-cars-riding-the-closed-road-etape-loch-ness,"Peter Walker takes in stunning views and steep climbs on one of an increasing number of UK cycling sportives that take place on routes shut to motor traffic

If there is one single activity most responsible for the recent mini-boom in Britons taking up road biking, it is arguably the sportive.

These organised, entry-only mass cycling events have sprung up around the UK in ever-increasing numbers. For various legal and insurance reasons they are not races but instead challenge riders only against the clock.

It is the done thing among some riders to disparage sportives. Racers might see them as a poor substitute for the real thing; tourers and other dilly-dallyers consider them overly corporate, restrictive and Lycra-dominated.

This, for me, misses the point. With challenges ranging from a relatively flat 40-odd miles to thigh-sapping marathons, such as the celebrated and fearsome Fred Whitton Challenge, sportives cater for many appetites and lung capacities. They’re not the only type of event around, but lots of people enjoy them.

Cycling in the 'Ayrshire Alps': welcome to the UK's only road cycling park Read more

A more recent development has been the closed road sportive, eliminating any interaction with motor traffic. This is a traditional element of a gran fondo or etape – the Italian and French equivalents – but relatively new in the UK.

A reasonable number exist now, the biggest of which is the Ride London 100, the Olympic legacy event which sends more than 20,000 riders through a car-free capital, into the hills of Surrey and back again.



While Birmingham is to get an equivalent city event in September, for fairly obvious logistical reasons the majority take place in less densely populated places, often in Wales and Scotland.



It was to the latter I travelled at the weekend to try out one of the better-known closed road sportives, and surely one of the most beautiful – the Etape Loch Ness.

As the name suggests, it’s a circuit of the loch, taking riders from Inverness up the east side of the water, across the tip at Fort Augustus, up a steep climb into the hills, and then back into the city.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A section of the Etape Loch Ness. Photograph: Etape Loch Ness/Tim Winterburn

It’s on this first section where the closed roads really pay off. The A82 is a narrow, picturesque and rolling route – perfect when your only companions are other bikes, but significantly less appealing if shared with cars, vans and trucks coming round bends at 60mph.

One repercussion is an early start, an effort to minimise the length of time the road is kept shut to motor traffic. My wave left at 6.19am, and all 5,000 or so riders were released in less than 40 minutes, meaning the early sections were slightly packed. It was also a chilly 5C at the start.

However, that’s where any caveats end. The event is a relatively brief (by sportive standards) 66 miles, but the long and steep climb out after Fort Augustus is pretty brutal, with a separate contest-within-a-contest for the fastest time to compete this section.

As you’d expect, the scenery is astonishing, both the loch-side vistas and also the climb into the hills. There are also some lovely touches from the organisers. Nearing the end of the climb I heard a fellow rider say to a friend, “I think I can hear the piper.” I assumed this was some sort of arcane Scottish cycling slang, only to crest the rise and see an actual piper serenading people as they passed the peak.

All this is done, of course, with some reciprocal benefits in mind. The event’s three biggest sponsors are the events arm of the Scottish tourist board, the Highlands council, and the Inverness tourist office. On Saturday, before the event, every fourth parked car in Inverness seemed to be carrying bikes, and the restaurants were packed with riders, many with their families.

Such events are an increasingly common way to boost tourism, and Inverness is also hosting a Loch Ness marathon in September.

While out patrolling on 11 April, ranger Joël Meriko Ari and Sgt Gerome Bolimola Afokao of the DRC armed forces heard gunshots, African Parks reported. The patrol unit followed signs and tracks until they discovered a group of six poachers who were chopping up a freshly slaughtered elephant carcass.

A shootout followed, in which both Ari and Afokao were fatally shot. There were also casualties among the poachers, but details were not disclosed.

Ari, 27, leaves behind a wife and two sons, while Afokao leaves behind a wife and nine children.

African Parks said they had observed “significant poaching activity” during the days preceding the shooting. Aerial surveillance had identified the poachers’ camp, and they had recorded carcasses of nine elephants.

“IUCN deplores the deaths of rangers Joël Meriko Ari and Sgt Bolimola Afokao of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo … and shares its most profound condolences with their families,” the International Union for Conservation of Nature said in a statement.

It is home to the last known wild population of the northern white rhinoceros, the rare Kordofan giraffes, and elephants – both forest elephants and savanna elephants as well as a hybrid of the two.

Once teeming with wildlife, Garamba is now a hotbed for armed poachers and guerrilla groups seeking ivory. In 2012, for example, poachers shot and killed 22 elephants, including babies, likely from a helicopter. In 2014, poachers killed 68 elephants in the park in just two months. The park is now estimated to have fewer than 2,000 elephants, down from 20,000 in the 1960s.

Garamba has also been plagued by violence against conservation workers. Last year, poachers shot five wildlife rangers in the park, killing three. In 2015, five rangers and three members of the Congolese armed forces are believed to have been killed by poachers in three incidents, according to African parks.

Thomas Nicolon, a wildlife photojournalist was on assignment for Mongabay in Garamba earlier this month.

“While in Garamba, I remember asking several park rangers if they were sometimes afraid while doing their job, knowing that armed poachers can be anywhere, anytime – and that many co-workers had been killed before.” Nicolon said the answer was always the same: “I’m not afraid. I have a weapon. If they open fire, I can defend myself.”

Nicolon also spent a week in Kahuzi-Biega National Park, where a ranger was killed by armed bandits less than 24 hours after he departed. He describes DRC rangers as “fearless, dedicated”. He added that when he asked about their pay, one ranger said: “The most important thing is to protect the animals of this park – money comes next.”

While working in Garamba, Nicolon was constantly under the protection of rangers. “It is with great sadness that I heard that two of them got killed a few days after I left the park,” he said. “Congolese park rangers do not earn big money. They’re not famous donors who give millions to conservation. They give their lives instead. They’re the unsung heroes of conservation.”

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/21/attenborough-guardian-headline-halts-borneo-bridge,"Officials in Borneo have cancelled plans to build a bridge across the Kinabatangan river, after warnings from Sir David Attenborough and other conservationists that it would gravely endanger pygmy elephants, orangutans and many other jungle species. The news comes just weeks after the Guardian revealed Attenborough’s opposition to the project.



Attenborough originally sent a private letter to the chief minister of the state of Sabah, Musa Aman, in September 2016. Last month, with signs pointing to the bridge still going ahead, the Guardian published excerpts from the letter. The authorities in Borneo have described Attenborough’s now-public opposition as the final blow to the project.

“I am immensely pleased to hear that plans to build a bridge at Sukau have been cancelled,” said Attenborough, who is a patron of the World Land Trust, which has saved forest in the Kinabatangan area. “This region is recognised worldwide as being a vital enclave for threatened wildlife, and it is indeed good news that the safe passage of orangutans, pygmy elephants and other endangered wildlife will not be threatened by the bridge and all that would have come with it. The decision will [also benefit] the local people who welcome visitors who come to see the wonderful biodiversity of their forests.”

I am immensely pleased that plans to build a bridge at Sukau have been cancelled David Attenborough

Datuk Sam Mannan, Sabah Forestry Department’s chief conservator, announced the state government’s decision on 19 April at a dinner in London held by the South East Asia Rainforest Research Partnership. “That headline broke the camel’s back,” Mannan said of the Guardian’s coverage. “It made us understand that the issue of a proposed bridge across a protected area for wildlife is now the number one environmental concern not just in Sabah, but globally too.”

The bridge would have spanned 350m, linking the village of Sukau with Litang and Tommanggong. While many locals supported it as a means to improve travel in the region, conservationists feared it would further imperil wildlife. Sukau is adjacent to the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, which is a popular eco-tourism site. Attenborough himself has visited the region several times.

Over the years the sanctuary has been hemmed in by spreading palm oil plantations, which have fragmented forests and blocked migratory routes for wildlife. Bornean elephants – the world’s smallest – are considered endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with a global population of only around 1,500. Bornean orangutans are listed as critically endangered. As they have lost their habitat, both species have seen increased run-ins with humans, including poachings and poisonings.

The conservationist and wildlife presenter Steve Backshall, who also attacked the bridge plans, described the Kinabatangan forest as “one of the single most important pieces of rainforest on Earth”.

This is one of the single most important pieces of rainforest on earth Steve Backshall

Last weekend, Backshall and his wife, Olympic champion rower Helen Glover, kayaked 125 miles along the Thames to raise funds for the World Land Trust’s work in the area.

“It’s a narrow wildlife corridor, allowing dispersal of a myriad of species big and small,” Blackshall said. “Fragmenting of this habitat – already beleaguered by ever-encroaching plantations – would be catastrophic. The decision to halt the Sukau bridge is a reason for great celebration.”

Experts have said there are alternatives to the bridge, including building further downstream or improving existing infrastructure.

“The chief minister of Sabah has taken everyone’s views into consideration – including Sir David’s – before deciding on this very important issue, and I am pleased to say that balanced development has prevailed,” Mannan said.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/13/i-liked-elephant-heart-it-was-soft-and-very-tasty,"For 40 years I hunted elephants and other big game in the forests of Rwanda. This is how I became an ex-poacher

I was born in Kinigi, in Rwanda’s Musanze district, about 65 years ago, and it is still my home. I come from the Batwa community; we are very short people. There are about 400 of us, which makes us the smallest tribe in Rwanda.



We lived in the forests long before the government took them over, and we were known as their keepers. They meant everything to us. I did not even know what a school was. Like my parents, my brother and my two sisters, all I knew was life in the forest.

For many years we depended on bush meat to feed ourselves. We also gathered fruit. We are good hunters and got used to killing any animal we wanted.

I started hunting at the age of 15, mostly with arrows but sometimes with traps. I could not afford a gun. My friends liked me because no animal could escape when we met. As well as small creatures like squirrels, hares and porcupines, I killed at least 200 big animals such as bushbucks and buffaloes – maybe more. We sold some of the meat for small amounts of money that we used to buy things like maize flour to supplement our diet. When I got married, this helped me to feed my wife and five children.

Sometimes we chanced upon “the big one” – the elephant. This was dangerous because it would fight back and chase us. And elephants are fast. We were happy when we killed one since it would feed us for many days, but I only liked the heart and the liver. These are very soft and tasty.

We would also trade the ivory for other foodstuffs. I hear some people made a lot of money selling ivory. But all the Batwa wanted was food, by whatever means.

I loved bush meat – it was always fresh. But it was also very tough, as you can see from the number of teeth I have lost. I used to think I was as strong as a lion but I was wrong.

One day the government came and told us that killing animals was illegal. Animals must be protected so that visitors could come and see them and pay money. This did not make sense to me. I only killed what my family and I needed to survive. I had been looking after the forest, although nobody had paid me for it. I could not understand how after 40 years it was now illegal to hunt animals. And so I carried on.

Was I a poacher? I didn't think so

I was not the only one, and many of the other hunters were arrested and sent to jail. It was sad. How can you be locked up simply for eating your staple diet? However, I learned that some had been capturing baby gorillas and selling them to white people as pets. The government called us ba rushimusi (poachers). Was I a rushimusi? I didn’t think so.

Then, in 2004, Edwin Sabuhoro arrived, with the job of protecting animals in what was now the Volcanoes National Park. He was a clever man. He met 100 of us and said he wanted to help us get food without killing animals. Again, I could not understand how that would be possible. But he told us he had a plan. He had convinced the government not to jail us if tried another way of putting food on the table.

Edwin told us that he had saved some of his salary and that he was going to use the money to rent farms where we could grow food. We liked the idea, though we had never farmed before.

I stopped hunting that same year. Within six months, we were producing enough potatoes, maize and wheat to feed ourselves – and a surplus to sell. When others in the forest heard about it, they came and joined us.

Two years later, Edwin helped us to establish the Iby’Iwacu cultural village, where we now entertain foreigners who come to Rwanda to see the gorillas. Tourists pay to stay here, and we sell our arts and crafts. We use the proceeds to preserve the same animals we used to kill.

As well as accompanying tourists on gorilla tracking expeditions, I try to hunt down anybody who wants to harm the elephants and gorillas and buffaloes. I have not caught anyone yet – but nobody will hurt the animals as long as I live. I am ready to die to protecting them.

Being a rushimusi is bad. Anyone still killing animals in the forest should find another way to make a living. If I can, they can.",guardian.com,False
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/06/secret-footage-obtained-of-the-wild-elephants-sold-into-captivity-in-chinese-zoos,"Animal welfare advocates have filmed some of the wild elephants captured in Zimbabwe last year and shipped to China

Last year more than 30 young elephants were captured from the wild in Zimbabwe and flown by plane to China. The elephants – some reported to be as young as three – were dispersed to a number of zoos throughout the country, including the Shanghai Wild Animal Park, the Beijing Wildlife Park and the Hangzhou Safari Park, according to conservationists.



But what are their lives like now?

This week, 12 of the calves went on show at the Shanghai park. The Weibo page for the zoo says their average age is four. The photos there were reviewed by Yolanda Pretorius, vice-chair of the Elephant Specialist Advisory Group of South Africa, who commented: “Overall their body condition seems to be slightly below average but it does not look as if they are starving. One of the elephants has temporal gland secretions and I am not sure whether this is a good or bad sign. In the wild, elephants mostly secrete from their temporal glands when they get excited.”

Meanwhile, recent photos and video said to show some of the elephants currently in Hangzhou reveal the animals behind bars and walking on concrete floors. The images were obtained by the animal welfare advocate Chunmei Hu, former secretary general of the Chinese Green Development and Endangered Species Fund.

The video has been reviewed by elephant experts, including Joyce Poole, co-founder of the Kenya-based Elephant Voices and renowned specialist on elephant behaviour. “They appear rather listless,” she says. “Perhaps waiting for something, but without much attention… Their housing is totally unstimulating. They look like sad, locked-up little kids.”

Aside from these snippets of evidence, there is little information on the conditions faced by these once-wild elephants. There is no official figures for how many elephants were sent to each zoo, although conservationists believe 17 of the calves ended up in Shanghai, 15 in Beijing and six in Hangzhou.

“It is heartwrenching not knowing the current fate of these animals,” says Iris Ho, wildlife campaign manager at Humane Society International. “It’s like knowing that someone – or children in this case, since they are baby elephants – is in danger or trapped in misery for the rest of their lives but there is nothing you can do about it.”

A 2016 report on elephants in Asia said that 47 zoos in China together hold at least 200 captive elephants – but the precise situation is “unclear”. Owners are supposed to register births, deaths, trade and movements, but the rule isn’t enforced or enforceable: “It appears that registration relies on voluntary compliance unless it becomes necessary in the interest of the owner.”

In 2012 a shipment of eight elephants was sent to China from Zimbabwe. Distressing footage was shot of one of those reportedly sent to Taiyuan zoo. In the video, the sickly-appearing calf seems to be trying to smash his way out of his confines. Named Xiaofei, he still lives alone at the Taiyuan zoo, according to Hu.



She believes that the other elephants imported into China that year are dead.

Compared with the trade in ivory, which has led to the slaughter of tens of thousands of elephants in Africa, the live trade in elephants receives far less attention. This is probably because it is legal, sanctioned by Cites, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A video of Xiaofei, shipped from Zimbabwe to China in 2012. Xiaofei lives alone at the Taiyuan zoo in China, according to animal welfare advocate Chunmei Hu.

A review of the Cites database shows many other wild elephant exports that took place over the last few years. Seven elephants were shipped from Tanzania to China in 2011, and two from Tanzania to South Korea. In 2011 and 2012 Monaco sold a total of 12 elephants, originally from Zimbabwe, to Denmark and the Czech Republic. They were probably performing animals. African elephants are a regular feature of the Monte Carlo International Circus.

In 2012, Namibia reported exporting 18 elephants to Mexico (Mexico says that only nine arrived), while in 2013 Namibia sent six to Cuba.

In July 2015, 27 wild elephants were shipped to Chinese zoos from Zimbabwe. Hu believes that one of those elephants is dead and that the others aren’t on public display. In September of the same year, China Central Television reported that 24 of the elephants were at the Changlong Breeding Center of Rare and Endangered Species of Wild Animals and Plants would be used for research.

Last year, 17 elephants were sent from Swaziland to three zoos in the US. Initially, there were to be 18, but one reportedly died before leaving Swaziland.

One of the conservationists’ concerns about the live trade is that there isn’t an independent body that adequately oversees these animals once they are captured and ultimately exported.

Cites allows live animals to be sent to “appropriate and acceptable destinations”. But the decision about what is “appropriate and acceptable” is left to the importing country’s scientific authority. It has to be satisfied that the animal is suitably housed and cared for, while the country of export must be satisfied that trade promotes conservation of elephants in the wild.

That’s not good enough for Keith Lindsay, a collaborating researcher with the Amboseli Trust for Elephants in Kenya: “There currently is under Cites no independent, objective mechanism of oversight or monitoring of the welfare conditions of elephants (or any animals) when they enter the live export chain.”

The minimal welfare standards that do exist are left entirely to the authorities that are already involved in the import and export. “If both countries say they are happy with the welfare aspects of the trade,” Lindsay says, “no matter how genuinely inadequate, there is nothing anyone else can say.”



Facebook Twitter Pinterest Elephants performing at the Shanghai Wild Animal Park in March 2017. Photograph: Chunmei Hu

What is needed, Lindsay argues, are Cites resolutions that specify stringent welfare conditions for the entire chain of live trade, including the eventual captivity: “The latter should replicate in every way the conditions of the native ecosystem, and there should be no impacts on the populations from which the animals are taken.”

There was an effort at the most recent Cites conference in Johannesburg to stop the live trade in elephants, led by the African Elephant Coalition, a group of 29 African nations. But China, the EU, the US and Zimbabwe did not support the resolution and it failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority to pass into law.



Meanwhile, rumours continue to circulate that China has a standing order for 100-200 elephant calves from Zimbabwe. And according to Jess Isden of Elephants for Africa, a conservation and research organization based in Botswana, recent captures in Hwange National Park are already damaging elephant behaviour. Large numbers of elephants have begun migrating into Botswana from Hwange, some making it as far as the Botetei river, hundreds of miles from their home range.

“The research is not yet conclusive,” she says, “but these animals, mostly young males, could be moving out of Hwange in direct response to the violent captures going on in Hwange.”

As for the elephants most recently sent to China from Zimbabwe, it is unclear if they will be forced to perform, but it appears likely in some cases.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Elephants performing at the Hangzhou Safari Park in June 2016. Photograph: Chunmei Hu

China’s State Forestry Administration issued a directive in July 2010 to end acts of cruelty in safari parks, including a ban on animal performances. However, Hu claims, in many cases these rules are being ignored. Just weeks ago, she says she photographed elephants, tigers, macaques and bears being forced to perform tricks at the Shanghai Wild Animal Park.

Photos of elephants said to have been taken at Hangzhou Safari Park in June 2016 also showed elephants performing tricks, including lifting people with their trunks and standing on stools.



For Scott Blais, founder of the Global Sanctuary for Elephants, who has worked with elephants for decades, such “tricks” are often taught by brutal means: “Elephant experts and advocates across the globe oppose the horrific training these elephants will endure. These practices are well known to be detrimental, violent and grossly inhumane, causing immeasurable psychological and emotional trauma.”

Efforts to ask Zimbabwean and Chinese Cites authorities about the condition of the elephants recently shipped to China met with no response.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/bureau-land-management-federal-lease,"Though recreation on public lands creates $646bn in economic stimulus and 6.1m jobs, Republicans are setting in motion a giveaway of Americans’ birthright

In the midst of highly publicized steps to dismantle insurance coverage for 32 million people and defund women’s healthcare facilities, Republican lawmakers have quietly laid the foundation to give away Americans’ birthright: 640m acres of national land. In a single line of changes to the rules for the House of Representatives, Republicans have overwritten the value of federal lands, easing the path to disposing of federal property even if doing so loses money for the government and provides no demonstrable compensation to American citizens.

At stake are areas managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Forests and Federal Wildlife Refuges, which contribute to an estimated $646bn each year in economic stimulus from recreation on public lands and 6.1m jobs. Transferring these lands to the states, critics fear, could decimate those numbers by eliminating mixed-use requirements, limiting public access and turning over large portions for energy or property development.

Repealing Obamacare would leave 32m without health coverage, analysis finds Read more

In addition to economic stimulus from outdoor activities, federal land creates revenue through oil and gas production, logging and other industrial uses. According to the BLM, in 2016, it made $2bn in royalty revenue from federal leases. The Outdoor Industry Association estimates federal tax revenue from the recreation economy at almost $40bn.

Ignoring those figures, the new language for the House budget, authored by Utah Republican representative Rob Bishop, who has a history of fighting to transfer public land to the states, says that federal land is effectively worthless. Transferring public land to “state, local government or tribal entity shall not be considered as providing new budget authority, decreasing revenues, increasing mandatory spending or increasing outlays.”

Essentially, the revised budget rules deny that federal land has any value at all, allowing the new Congress to sidestep requirements that a bill giving away a piece of federal land does not decrease federal revenue or contribute to the federal debt.

Republican eagerness to cede federal land to local governments for possible sale, mining or development is already moving states to act. Western states, where most federal land is concentrated, are already introducing legislation that pave the way for land transfers.

In Wyoming, for example, the 2017 senate has introduced a joint resolution that would amend the state constitution to dictate how public land given to the state by the federal government after 2019 is managed. It has little public support, but Wyoming Senate President Eli Bebout said that he thought the state should be preemptively thinking about what it would do with federal land.

The Congressional devaluation of national property is the most far-reaching legislative change in a recent push to transfer federal lands to the states. Because of the Republican majority in Congress, bills proposing land transfers could now swiftly diminish Forest Service and BLM lands across the country.

“We didn’t see it coming. I think it was sneaky and underhanded. It exemplifies an effort to not play by the rules,” said Alan Rowsome, senior director of government relations at The Wilderness Society. “This is the worst Congress for public lands ever.”

Rowsome said he’s not exactly sure how the rule will be used, but he thinks the first places to come under attack might include areas adjacent to the majestic Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona and Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Those areas hold uranium and copper, respectively.

Rowsome said he’s worried that sensitive tracts of public land, like the oil-rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, could soon be up for sale. Some 60% percent of Alaska is made up of national land, and the state’s representatives have tried to pass laws claiming parts of it for state use as recently as 2015. “It’s an amazing ecosystem and worthy of protection, and it’s very likely that House Republican majority will open that up for drilling,” Rowsome said.

This latest effort comes on the heels of a bill adopted in 2016 that directs the Department of Agriculture to transfer 2m acres of eligible Forest Service lands to each state.

Giving away national land has been part of the Republican Party platform since the mid-80s, after Reagan declared himself a Sagebrush Rebel, but it’s regained steam in the past few years as 20 states have introduced some form of legislation suggesting that federal property be given to local governments.

In 2015, Bishop and fellow Utah representative Chris Stewart formed the Federal Land Action Group, a congressional team with the specific intent to come up with a framework for transferring public land. “Washington bureaucrats don’t listen to people,” Bishop said in a statement. “Local governments do.”

But Rowsome argues that’s a populist message without any popular support, pushed by a small faction of legislators with support from industries like mining and energy. Despite the Republican message that Washington has overstepped in designating national parks and monuments, a 2016 study found that 95% of the American public believes that National Parks are worth protecting and 80% said they’d be willing to pay higher taxes to do so.

“Western Republicans that are perpetuating the idea are very well funded by the oil and gas industry during their campaign,” Rowsome said. “It’s special interests wielding power for an agenda that will advance their goal. Nearly 90% of BLM lands are already open, but they can’t stop trying to get more.”

A 2016 Colorado College survey of seven western states found that 60% of voters rejected both the sale of public lands to states and giving states control without sale.

In 2012, Arizona voters struck down two pieces of legislation that would have turned over federal land to the state, including one that claimed the Grand Canyon as state land.

Opponents fear that local governments, especially in states with small budgets, won’t be able to invest in management and will sell off land to make money. Last summer, the Forest Service was spending $240m a week to suppress wildfires, and the Department of Interior estimates the cost of deferred maintenance, like updating roads, at around $11bn.

In December, Wyoming Governor Matt Mead said that transferring public land to his state was legally and financially impractical. He cited firefighting costs on public land as something that the state budget wouldn’t have room for.

Historically, when federal lands have been transferred to states, they have become less accessible. Idaho sold off almost 100,000 acres of its public land between 2000 and 2009. In Colorado, access has been limited the public can only use 20% of state trust land for hunting and fishing.



John Gale, conservation director for the advocacy group Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, said that he’s worried about access for sportsmen. He believes that there’s a further danger in segmenting ecosystems through state-by-state development.

“70% of the headwaters of our streams and rivers in the West are on public lands,” he said. “Rivers and migratory corridors don’t follow state boundaries.”

The incoming administration hasn’t been clear about where it falls on transfers. Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke, tapped to be the next Secretary of the Interior, voted for the rules package, but in the past he’s been against land transfers. President-elect Donald Trump has spoken out against reallocating federal land, but he’s also met with prominent pro-land transfer groups.

Nevertheless, bills proposing land transfer will now have an easy route to passage, as they won’t need to be backed by any financial justification.

The entire rules package passed on party lines, but it runs counter to legislation that passed both the House and Senate in November, the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act of 2016. Signed into law in December, the legislation requires the Department of Commerce to count the over half a trillion dollars from the outdoor recreation economy in the country’s GDP for the first time.

“It’s not just natural resources that are on the auction block, but jobs,” said Gale. “For a party that prides itself on being fiscally conservative ... they’re talking out of both sides of their mouth.”

https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/nov/30/cosmetics-beauty-green-eco-labeling-toxic-ewg,"It may soon be easier for shoppers to find beauty products without toxic chemicals. The Environmental Working Group nonprofit launched a new label this month called EWG Verified, which certifies personal care products as free from chemicals of concern.

The program is an extension of the group’s work with the Skin Deep database, which for more than a decade now has given tens of millions of visitors information on the chemical contents and relative safety of their favorite cosmetics and shampoos.

Before now, the personal care industry has mostly shied away from eco-labels, in spite of rising interest in non-toxic beauty products from consumers and the increasing popularity of eco-labels for other types of consumer products.

The number of eco-labels on consumer products across industries has grown from a few dozen in the 1990s to more than 400 today. The labels have helped some companies justify price premiums, but have also served to confuse consumers in industries like food where a large number of labels with varying degrees of credibility – ranging from baseless “all natural” claims to more rigorous organic certifications – can make it difficult for shoppers to separate the green from the greenwashed.

On-package labeling could become a common practice as retailers like Walmart and Target roll out programs vetting the chemical ingredients in personal care products.

“Eco-labeling is a critical step in the regulation of the private sector, and third party labels are generally more trustworthy than the industry’s self-certified labels,” says Xinghua Li, a professor of media studies at Babson College, who researches green advertising. “The cosmetic industry needs it just as urgently as the food industry: products we put on our skin are just as important as the food we put into our mouths.”

An increase in eco-certification programs could be good for the personal care industry even if it doesn’t equate to more on-product labels. In a recent study on the value of eco-labels, UCLA researchers linked the rise of eco-labels to the price premium they can help command, but pointed out that the certification processes behind various labels alone can also deliver benefits to companies. The researchers cite the wine industry as an example because so many vineyards go through eco certification programs but opt not to use the companion eco-labels on their bottles.

“We find that consumers are not willing to pay a premium for wine eco-labels, but that certified though unlabeled wine enjoys a significant premium,” writes Magali Delmas, the lead author of the study. Delmas adds that eco certification may lead to improved production processes, which in turn help to produce a higher quality product that can be sold at a price premium.

That could be a template for personal care products, too. Nneka Leiba, deputy director of research for EWG, says she hopes consumers will recognize and trust the EWG Verified label, which will then persuade more personal care manufacturers to stop using toxic chemicals. “We thought it could be useful for consumers to see something at the point of sale, but also we were hearing pretty frequently from companies, asking if they could use our logo on their products to indicate that they had scored well in the Skin Deep database,” she says. “And we thought, ‘Hey that’s good idea, let’s make some criteria’.”

Criteria for using the EWG Verified mark are slightly more stringent than those for scoring green in the Skin Deep database.

In the database, EWG checks product ingredients against available studies and government databases on chemical toxicity, then assigns a score of one to 10 to each product based on more than a dozen criteria related to its relative hazard and how much information is available about the product and its ingredients. Products in the 0-2 range are marked green for “low hazards”; those with a score of 3-6 are yellow for “moderate hazards”; and products scoring 7-10 are listed as red for “high hazards”.

To qualify for the EWG Verified seal, a product must not contain any of the ingredients on EWG’s lists of restricted and unacceptable ingredients. Companies also must fully disclose all ingredients on the label (and not use any catch-all terms like “fragrance”, for example) and must prove they are adequately preserving their products without using toxic chemicals.

The new seal doesn’t mean the Skin Deep database is coming to an end, however. EWG will continue to run the database because not every company – or every product within a company – will be eligible for the EWG Verified mark. Most sunscreens and products containing popular facial cream ingredient retinol, for example, do not meet the criteria for EWG Verified.

“The database is also necessary for showcasing bad actors in the market – those that are scoring red or yellow – and differentiating those brands and products from those that are rating green,” Leiba adds.

Healthy Lifestyle Brands, a brand management firm that works with various wellness-focused businesses, is administering the EWG Verified mark. Companies have to pay to apply for certification, but EWG wouldn’t disclose the fees. The money will help pay for EWG’s ongoing research into ingredients and will cover the costs of administering the program, according to EWG spokesperson Monica Amarelo.

EWG Verified has launched with two brands: Beauty Counter and MyChelle Cosmetics. MyChelle chief marketing officer Kimberly Heathman says she expects the EWG Verified seal will help attract new customers. MyChelle plans to market its EWG Verified affiliation on its website, marketing materials and product packaging.

Rebecca Brooks, a marketing consultant and founder of the market research firm Alter Agents, says the label will help brands differentiate themselves even if they do nothing more than put it on their products. “Consumers will see it as an official label, so even if people don’t know EWG, it will stand out to them,” she says.



Brooks says it could also help cultivate customer loyalty, especially given her firm’s research showing that brand loyalty is waning these days. Factors such as prices and product reviews tend to sway millennials more than they do brand-loyal boomers. More certification programs for personal care products could emerge if EWG Verified proves to be successful in boosting sales for its participants.

However, a label boom in the personal care industry could be problematic for both the companies in the EWG Verified program and consumers. More labels could confuse consumers, water down the value of EWG Verified and leave companies once again struggling to differentiate themselves, according to Brooks.

“If I were a brand that was going to pay EWG to get verified, I would want some certainty that the marketplace won’t become crowded with other stamps and labels that would make my EWG marker irrelevant,” Brooks says. “So there’s a certain onus on them to promote and push to consumers about their label, what it means, and why it matters.”",guardian.com,False

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/bureau-land-management-federal-lease,"Though recreation on public lands creates $646bn in economic stimulus and 6.1m jobs, Republicans are setting in motion a giveaway of Americans’ birthright

In the midst of highly publicized steps to dismantle insurance coverage for 32 million people and defund women’s healthcare facilities, Republican lawmakers have quietly laid the foundation to give away Americans’ birthright: 640m acres of national land. In a single line of changes to the rules for the House of Representatives, Republicans have overwritten the value of federal lands, easing the path to disposing of federal property even if doing so loses money for the government and provides no demonstrable compensation to American citizens.

At stake are areas managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Forests and Federal Wildlife Refuges, which contribute to an estimated $646bn each year in economic stimulus from recreation on public lands and 6.1m jobs. Transferring these lands to the states, critics fear, could decimate those numbers by eliminating mixed-use requirements, limiting public access and turning over large portions for energy or property development.

In addition to economic stimulus from outdoor activities, federal land creates revenue through oil and gas production, logging and other industrial uses. According to the BLM, in 2016, it made $2bn in royalty revenue from federal leases. The Outdoor Industry Association estimates federal tax revenue from the recreation economy at almost $40bn.

Ignoring those figures, the new language for the House budget, authored by Utah Republican representative Rob Bishop, who has a history of fighting to transfer public land to the states, says that federal land is effectively worthless. Transferring public land to “state, local government or tribal entity shall not be considered as providing new budget authority, decreasing revenues, increasing mandatory spending or increasing outlays.”

Essentially, the revised budget rules deny that federal land has any value at all, allowing the new Congress to sidestep requirements that a bill giving away a piece of federal land does not decrease federal revenue or contribute to the federal debt.

Republican eagerness to cede federal land to local governments for possible sale, mining or development is already moving states to act. Western states, where most federal land is concentrated, are already introducing legislation that pave the way for land transfers.

In Wyoming, for example, the 2017 senate has introduced a joint resolution that would amend the state constitution to dictate how public land given to the state by the federal government after 2019 is managed. It has little public support, but Wyoming Senate President Eli Bebout said that he thought the state should be preemptively thinking about what it would do with federal land.

The Congressional devaluation of national property is the most far-reaching legislative change in a recent push to transfer federal lands to the states. Because of the Republican majority in Congress, bills proposing land transfers could now swiftly diminish Forest Service and BLM lands across the country.

“We didn’t see it coming. I think it was sneaky and underhanded. It exemplifies an effort to not play by the rules,” said Alan Rowsome, senior director of government relations at The Wilderness Society. “This is the worst Congress for public lands ever.”

Rowsome said he’s not exactly sure how the rule will be used, but he thinks the first places to come under attack might include areas adjacent to the majestic Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona and Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Those areas hold uranium and copper, respectively.

Rowsome said he’s worried that sensitive tracts of public land, like the oil-rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, could soon be up for sale. Some 60% percent of Alaska is made up of national land, and the state’s representatives have tried to pass laws claiming parts of it for state use as recently as 2015. “It’s an amazing ecosystem and worthy of protection, and it’s very likely that House Republican majority will open that up for drilling,” Rowsome said.

This latest effort comes on the heels of a bill adopted in 2016 that directs the Department of Agriculture to transfer 2m acres of eligible Forest Service lands to each state.

Giving away national land has been part of the Republican Party platform since the mid-80s, after Reagan declared himself a Sagebrush Rebel, but it’s regained steam in the past few years as 20 states have introduced some form of legislation suggesting that federal property be given to local governments.

In 2015, Bishop and fellow Utah representative Chris Stewart formed the Federal Land Action Group, a congressional team with the specific intent to come up with a framework for transferring public land. “Washington bureaucrats don’t listen to people,” Bishop said in a statement. “Local governments do.”

But Rowsome argues that’s a populist message without any popular support, pushed by a small faction of legislators with support from industries like mining and energy. Despite the Republican message that Washington has overstepped in designating national parks and monuments, a 2016 study found that 95% of the American public believes that National Parks are worth protecting and 80% said they’d be willing to pay higher taxes to do so.

“Western Republicans that are perpetuating the idea are very well funded by the oil and gas industry during their campaign,” Rowsome said. “It’s special interests wielding power for an agenda that will advance their goal. Nearly 90% of BLM lands are already open, but they can’t stop trying to get more.”

A 2016 Colorado College survey of seven western states found that 60% of voters rejected both the sale of public lands to states and giving states control without sale.

In 2012, Arizona voters struck down two pieces of legislation that would have turned over federal land to the state, including one that claimed the Grand Canyon as state land.

Opponents fear that local governments, especially in states with small budgets, won’t be able to invest in management and will sell off land to make money. Last summer, the Forest Service was spending $240m a week to suppress wildfires, and the Department of Interior estimates the cost of deferred maintenance, like updating roads, at around $11bn.

In December, Wyoming Governor Matt Mead said that transferring public land to his state was legally and financially impractical. He cited firefighting costs on public land as something that the state budget wouldn’t have room for.

Historically, when federal lands have been transferred to states, they have become less accessible. Idaho sold off almost 100,000 acres of its public land between 2000 and 2009. In Colorado, access has been limited the public can only use 20% of state trust land for hunting and fishing.



John Gale, conservation director for the advocacy group Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, said that he’s worried about access for sportsmen. He believes that there’s a further danger in segmenting ecosystems through state-by-state development.

“70% of the headwaters of our streams and rivers in the West are on public lands,” he said. “Rivers and migratory corridors don’t follow state boundaries.”

The incoming administration hasn’t been clear about where it falls on transfers. Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke, tapped to be the next Secretary of the Interior, voted for the rules package, but in the past he’s been against land transfers. President-elect Donald Trump has spoken out against reallocating federal land, but he’s also met with prominent pro-land transfer groups.

Nevertheless, bills proposing land transfer will now have an easy route to passage, as they won’t need to be backed by any financial justification.

The entire rules package passed on party lines, but it runs counter to legislation that passed both the House and Senate in November, the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act of 2016. Signed into law in December, the legislation requires the Department of Commerce to count the over half a trillion dollars from the outdoor recreation economy in the country’s GDP for the first time.

“It’s not just natural resources that are on the auction block, but jobs,” said Gale. “For a party that prides itself on being fiscally conservative ... they’re talking out of both sides of their mouth.”

https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/nov/30/cosmetics-beauty-green-eco-labeling-toxic-ewg,"It may soon be easier for shoppers to find beauty products without toxic chemicals. The Environmental Working Group nonprofit launched a new label this month called EWG Verified, which certifies personal care products as free from chemicals of concern.

The program is an extension of the group’s work with the Skin Deep database, which for more than a decade now has given tens of millions of visitors information on the chemical contents and relative safety of their favorite cosmetics and shampoos.

Before now, the personal care industry has mostly shied away from eco-labels, in spite of rising interest in non-toxic beauty products from consumers and the increasing popularity of eco-labels for other types of consumer products.

The number of eco-labels on consumer products across industries has grown from a few dozen in the 1990s to more than 400 today. The labels have helped some companies justify price premiums, but have also served to confuse consumers in industries like food where a large number of labels with varying degrees of credibility – ranging from baseless “all natural” claims to more rigorous organic certifications – can make it difficult for shoppers to separate the green from the greenwashed.

On-package labeling could become a common practice as retailers like Walmart and Target roll out programs vetting the chemical ingredients in personal care products.

“Eco-labeling is a critical step in the regulation of the private sector, and third party labels are generally more trustworthy than the industry’s self-certified labels,” says Xinghua Li, a professor of media studies at Babson College, who researches green advertising. “The cosmetic industry needs it just as urgently as the food industry: products we put on our skin are just as important as the food we put into our mouths.”

An increase in eco-certification programs could be good for the personal care industry even if it doesn’t equate to more on-product labels. In a recent study on the value of eco-labels, UCLA researchers linked the rise of eco-labels to the price premium they can help command, but pointed out that the certification processes behind various labels alone can also deliver benefits to companies. The researchers cite the wine industry as an example because so many vineyards go through eco certification programs but opt not to use the companion eco-labels on their bottles.

“We find that consumers are not willing to pay a premium for wine eco-labels, but that certified though unlabeled wine enjoys a significant premium,” writes Magali Delmas, the lead author of the study. Delmas adds that eco certification may lead to improved production processes, which in turn help to produce a higher quality product that can be sold at a price premium.

That could be a template for personal care products, too. Nneka Leiba, deputy director of research for EWG, says she hopes consumers will recognize and trust the EWG Verified label, which will then persuade more personal care manufacturers to stop using toxic chemicals. “We thought it could be useful for consumers to see something at the point of sale, but also we were hearing pretty frequently from companies, asking if they could use our logo on their products to indicate that they had scored well in the Skin Deep database,” she says. “And we thought, ‘Hey that’s good idea, let’s make some criteria’.”

Criteria for using the EWG Verified mark are slightly more stringent than those for scoring green in the Skin Deep database.

In the database, EWG checks product ingredients against available studies and government databases on chemical toxicity, then assigns a score of one to 10 to each product based on more than a dozen criteria related to its relative hazard and how much information is available about the product and its ingredients. Products in the 0-2 range are marked green for “low hazards”; those with a score of 3-6 are yellow for “moderate hazards”; and products scoring 7-10 are listed as red for “high hazards”.

To qualify for the EWG Verified seal, a product must not contain any of the ingredients on EWG’s lists of restricted and unacceptable ingredients. Companies also must fully disclose all ingredients on the label (and not use any catch-all terms like “fragrance”, for example) and must prove they are adequately preserving their products without using toxic chemicals.

The new seal doesn’t mean the Skin Deep database is coming to an end, however. EWG will continue to run the database because not every company – or every product within a company – will be eligible for the EWG Verified mark. Most sunscreens and products containing popular facial cream ingredient retinol, for example, do not meet the criteria for EWG Verified.

“The database is also necessary for showcasing bad actors in the market – those that are scoring red or yellow – and differentiating those brands and products from those that are rating green,” Leiba adds.

Healthy Lifestyle Brands, a brand management firm that works with various wellness-focused businesses, is administering the EWG Verified mark. Companies have to pay to apply for certification, but EWG wouldn’t disclose the fees. The money will help pay for EWG’s ongoing research into ingredients and will cover the costs of administering the program, according to EWG spokesperson Monica Amarelo.

EWG Verified has launched with two brands: Beauty Counter and MyChelle Cosmetics. MyChelle chief marketing officer Kimberly Heathman says she expects the EWG Verified seal will help attract new customers. MyChelle plans to market its EWG Verified affiliation on its website, marketing materials and product packaging.

Rebecca Brooks, a marketing consultant and founder of the market research firm Alter Agents, says the label will help brands differentiate themselves even if they do nothing more than put it on their products. “Consumers will see it as an official label, so even if people don’t know EWG, it will stand out to them,” she says.



Brooks says it could also help cultivate customer loyalty, especially given her firm’s research showing that brand loyalty is waning these days. Factors such as prices and product reviews tend to sway millennials more than they do brand-loyal boomers. More certification programs for personal care products could emerge if EWG Verified proves to be successful in boosting sales for its participants.

However, a label boom in the personal care industry could be problematic for both the companies in the EWG Verified program and consumers. More labels could confuse consumers, water down the value of EWG Verified and leave companies once again struggling to differentiate themselves, according to Brooks.

“If I were a brand that was going to pay EWG to get verified, I would want some certainty that the marketplace won’t become crowded with other stamps and labels that would make my EWG marker irrelevant,” Brooks says. “So there’s a certain onus on them to promote and push to consumers about their label, what it means, and why it matters.”",guardian.com,False
