The alleged attacker, 25-year-old Taylor Mazzanti, was arrested on felony battery charges Saturday. He was booked into St. Lucie County Jail and released on a $3,750 bond, according to the jail. After the attack, the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Florida said it plans to file a complaint with Gov. Rick Scott and the U.S. Department of Justice. In a press release, the group says local authorities ignored requests for increased security, despite numerous threats since Mateen fatally shot 49 people at a nightclub on June 12. At about 4:15 a.m. Saturday, a time when some are still praying during the holy month of Ramadan, a white truck stopped in front of the mosque. A man stepped out uttering racial slurs, according to the press release from the council, which is the largest Muslim civil rights group in Florida. “You Muslims need to get back to your country,” the man reportedly said before hitting the mosque member in the head and knocking out a tooth, according to the press release. The victim wasn’t identified, and it wasn’t clear if he was hospitalized. Abdul Rauf Khan, the assistant executive director of Islamic Circle of North America Relief, reportedly saw the altercation and called 911. Two St. Lucie County Sheriff deputies arrived at the scene and arrested the suspect about an hour later. In a release from the Port St. Lucie Sheriff’s Office, Sheriff Ken Mascara said interviews and a written witness statement from the victim “do not indicate any racially-motivated comments were made by the suspect prior to, during or after the incident.” “The untruthful rhetoric from the mosque and its spokesperson is doing nothing more than trying to bring empathy to their cause, which I hope our community recognizes,” Sheriff Mascara said. “My office, including myself and our agency Chaplain, have repeatedly attempted to communicate with the mosque to explore options of working together and there has been no response.” A West Palm Beach Beach TV reporter tweeted pictures of the victim and his bloody hands as he was photographed by police. “This should not have happened,” Wilfredo Ruiz, CAIR-Florida’s communications director, said in the release. “For over two weeks we have been emphasizing that the community from the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce needs to be offered security from the Sheriff’s Office. Unfortunately, our requests were repeatedly ignored. Will someone have to be killed for the sheriff to provide safety and security to this Mosque?” Ruiz said the Fort Pierce mosque’s leaders have attempted to hire St. Lucie County sheriff’s deputies to provide security but have been rejected, Miami Herald news partner CBS4 reported on Tuesday. The mosque has about 100 regular members, including Mateen’s father. About 170,000 Muslims attend about 120 mosques in Florida, according to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies. “Muslims are part of the community just like everyone else,” Ruiz said in the release. “It is his duty and responsibility to ensure the safety of all his citizens.” St. Lucie Sheriff Ken Mascara had issued a statement Friday saying deputies were patrolling the mosque more frequently but the office didn’t have the staffing levels to place guards there, even if reimbursed. “The terrorist attack in Orlando has our entire agency working extremely hard,” Mascara said in the statement. “Our first and primary mission is to ensure the continued safety and security of our entire county. Placing patrol units at specific locations by special request, even if reimbursed by the requesting party, is evaluated based on staffing levels and can at times limit our ability to maintain our mission and appropriately respond to the entire community.”",A local paper,1
Article2.txt,"﻿Murderer of Laguna hotel manager gets life without parole By ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER March 1, 2014 at 7:30 am     SANTA ANA – A 23-year-old Lake Forest man will spend the rest of his life in prison for the 2009 bludgeoning death of a beloved Laguna Beach hotel manager. Friends of victim Damon Nicholson wept Friday as Judge James A. Stotler ordered Matthew Thomas Dragna to serve the sentence with no chance of parole. Stotler read out the sentence to a quiet, mostly empty courtroom Friday, save the occasional rattle of Dragna’s jailhouse chains, the whistle of wind as a storm blew outside and the quiet sobs of two of Nicholson’s close friends, who comforted each other during the proceeding. “May he never feel the warmth of a hug from a loved one, share happy times with those he cares about or have the freedom to pursue his dreams. Your honor, take from him some of what he took from Damon and those that loved him,” said Carla Bravo, Nicholson’s friend of 20 years, during an impassioned statement to the court. “Justice must be served.” No more long talks on the phone, movie nights with bonbons or Trivial Pursuit after spending Thanksgivings together, Bravo told the court. The two met while working together at Denny’s, she said. Nicholson, who was a sales and catering manager at Hotel Laguna, was found bludgeoned to death in his Dolphin Way apartment on Oct. 24, 2009. A jury convicted Dragna of murder during a robbery – a special circumstance under California law with a penalty of death or life without parole. Prosecutors said Dragna, after having a sex with Nicholson the night before in a sexual threesome arranged with a mutual lover, enlisted his friend Jacob Anthony Quintanilla to rob Nicholson at his apartment. During the robbery, Nicholson was beaten with a baseball bat brought by Quintanilla, fracturing his skull, prosecutors said. His body was found the next day when a concerned coworker checked on him after he didn’t show up. Dragna’s DNA was found on a trash can, and prosecutors said he tried to sell Nicholson’s Apple laptop and Adobe software online. Public Defender Frank Bittar argued during a December trial that Dragna set up a liaison with Nicholson, didn’t intend to commit a robbery and didn’t see the baseball bat until afterwards. After serving 1,564 days in jail according to public defender Frank Bittar, Dragna’s appearance changed from his 2009 mugshot – heavier, with a shaved head, beard, glasses and a book on his lap. As Stotler told Dragna he’d spend the rest of his life in prison, his face was motionless. Stotler said even if state law didn’t leave Dragna ineligible for parole, “the court would not grant (it) in light of the circumstances and (the defendant’s) prior record.” Stotler referred to a probation officer report “basically indicating” that he was a “career criminal.” Those incidents included felony charges both as a juvenile and an adult – including a 2009 conviction for drug possession and a 2008 conviction for second-degree burglary. Bittar said given the crime, he found the sentence to be “draconian,” cruel and unusual, and potentially violating the 8th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, though he didn’t make a formal motion. “My hands are tied, as I believe, respectfully, the court’s hands are tied,” Bittar said. “Perhaps someday down the road 10 to 15 years from now … someone may find my comments interesting.” Bittar embraced Dragna’s mother Renee after the verdict. She quietly wiped tears away during the proceedings. Bravo said she was happy with the sentence – though Tammy Hileman, a friend for five years and fellow photography student, said she would have preferred the death penalty. Hileman wore cropped pants to the hearing to sport a tattoo she got in Nicholson’s memory – a black ribbon encircled by a rainbow, his birth and death dates and his name. Pink wings stretch out from the ribbon “so he’s in heaven,” Hileman said. She told Bravo before the hearing she’s planning an addition – the words “justice served.” But Hileman and Bravo both said it isn’t over – Quintanilla has a pretrial hearing scheduled March 21 at 9 a.m. in the same courtroom Dragna received his sentence.

Article3.txt,"﻿They terrorized a black child’s party, then cried when a judge read their sentences BY BEN GUARINO The Washington Post    * LINKEDIN    * GOOGLE+    * PINTEREST    * REDDIT    * PRINT    * ORDER REPRINT OF THIS STORY In July 2015, a group of 15 people calling themselves “Respect the Flag” boarded several pickup trucks, each outfitted with Confederate and American flags, and embarked on a drive around Douglasville, Ga., a small city west of Atlanta. Tensions around displaying the Confederate flag were already high. Barely a month had passed since Dylann Roof, the avowed white supremacist who had posed with the Confederate battle flag, killed nine black Americans at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. And the small “Respect the Flag” group went far beyond a display of Confederate pride. Hatred, a Georgia judge said during a sentencing Monday, propelled the group as they descended upon a child’s birthday party and unleashed a storm of death threats and anti-black slurs, and pointed a shotgun. ADVERTISING “Their actions were motivated by racial hatred,” said Judge William McClain, of the Douglas County Superior Court, according to the Associated Press. Georgia legislature does not include a law regarding hate crimes. The 10 men and five women who made up “Respect the Flag” harassed black drivers as well as customers at a Walmart and a convenience store.     Two convicted for racial threats against black people at party sentenced to prison WGCL - Atlanta, GA     Then they happened upon a birthday party being held in Douglasville for an 8-year-old black child. Witnesses told the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit group that tracks hate crimes, that after driving the trucks across the property belonging to the child’s grandmother, the men exited the vehicles. The “Respect the Flag” group began to yell racial epithets and shout death threats. “They even threatened to kill children at the party,” according to a statement issued by Douglas County District Attorney Brian Fortner in early February. One of the men, 26-year-old Jose Ismael Torres, pointed a black pump shotgun at the partygoers, prosecutors said. Several panicked citizens called the police. “Everywhere you went, 911 call centers were flooded with calls,” the judge said, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. “I was scared,” Melissa Alford, the host of the party, told the Southern Poverty Law Center in October, a few days after the group’s members were indicted. “My first thought was if these people start shooting at us, we wouldn’t be able to get all the kids inside the house in time.” The defendants in the case argued that a party attendee triggered the incident by hurling an object at one of the trucks. Cellphone video taken at the scene showed otherwise, the judge said. “If you drive around town with a Confederate flag, yelling the n-word, you know how it’s going to be interpreted,” the judge said, per Atlanta’s Fox 5. “It’s inexplicable to me that you weren’t arrested by the police that day.” The members of the group, two of whom pleaded guilty, were convicted in early February. Following the convictions, the Douglas County district attorney issued a statement clarifying that this case was not an issue of the First Amendment but of harassment. “Many people tried to make the case about simply flying the Confederate battle flag. However, it wasn’t about that at all,” Fortner said in the statement. “Instead, this case was about a group of people riding around our community, drinking alcohol, harassing and intimidating our citizens because of the color of their skin.” The judge handed down the final two sentences on Monday. Torres was sentenced 20 years, serving 13 in prison. The mother of his children, Kayla Rae Norton, 25, was sentenced to 15 years and will serve six. After their prison terms, they will be banished from Douglas County. They were found in violation of Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act; Norton was found guilty of violating the act as well as a count of making terroristic threats. The jury convicted Torres of three counts of aggravated assault, one count of making terroristic threats and one count of violating the act. The scene in the courtroom was an emotional one. Both Torres and Norton cried as their sentences were announced, the Associated Press reported. Norton apologized to the victims. One of the victims, Hyesha Bryant, expressed her forgiveness. “I forgive you,” Bryant said. “And to your family, I’m sorry it had to come this far.”",A local paper,1

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews) NEW YORK | A former journalist fired for fabricating details in stories made at least eight of the scores of threats against Jewish institutions nationwide, including a bomb threat to the Anti-Defamation League, as part of a bizarre campaign to harass and frame his ex-girlfriend, federal officials said Friday. Juan Thompson was arrested in St. Louis and appeared there in federal court Friday on a cyberstalking charge. He politely answered questions and told the judge he had enough money to hire a lawyer. A crowd of supporters who attended said Thompson had no criminal record. His lawyer didn’t comment. ADVERTISING Federal officials have been investigating 122 bomb threats called in to Jewish organizations in three dozen states since Jan. 9 and a rash of vandalism at Jewish cemeteries. Thompson started making threats Jan. 28, a criminal complaint said, with an email to the Jewish History Museum in New York written from an account that made it appear as if it were being sent by an ex-girlfriend. “Juan Thompson put 2 bombs in the History Museum set to go off Sunday,” it said. He followed that up with similar messages to a Jewish school in Farmington Hills, Michigan, and to a school and community center in Manhattan, authorities said. In another round of emails and phone calls, he gave the woman’s name, rather than his own, the court complaint said. The Council on American-Islamic Relations received an anonymous email saying the woman put a bomb in a Dallas Jewish center. Thompson, who’s black, then took to Twitter: “Know any good lawyers?” he wrote. “Need to stop this nasty/racist #whitegirl I dated who sent a bomb threat in my name.” He later tweeted to the Secret Service: “I’m been (sic) tormented by an anti-Semite. She sent an antijewish bomb threat in my name. Help.” But police say it was a hoax created to make the woman look guilty. Thompson also made threats in which he identified the woman as the culprit, authorities said. It’s unclear why Jewish organizations were targeted. Republican President Donald Trump suggested in a meeting Tuesday with state attorneys general the threats against Jewish community centers may have been designed to make “others look bad,” according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Trump also has condemned violence against Jewish organizations. Thompson was fired from the online publication The Intercept last year after being accused of fabricating several quotes and creating fake email accounts to impersonate people, including the Intercept’s editor-in-chief. One of the stories involved Dylann Roof, the white shooter of black worshippers at a Charleston, South Carolina, church. Thompson had written that a cousin named Scott Roof claimed the gunman was angry that a love interest chose a black man over him. A review showed there was no cousin by that name. The story was retracted. The Intercept wrote Friday it was “horrified” to learn of Thompson’s arrest. Thompson had been accused of bizarre behavior before. Doyle Murphy, a reporter at the Riverfront Times, an alternative weekly in St. Louis, said he was subjected to social media harassment after writing about Thompson’s troubled past in the fallout from his firing at The Intercept. Murphy said Thompson set up anonymous accounts on Twitter and other social media posing as a woman who claimed she had been sexually assaulted by Murphy. Murphy said he contacted Twitter but every time one fake account was taken down a new one popped up. He said he contacted police but there was little they could do. “It was a nightmare, and there’s not a whole lot I could do about it,” Murphy said. The Federal Communications Commission said Friday it will grant an emergency waiver allowing Jewish community centers and their phone carriers to track the numbers of callers who make threats, even if the callers try to block the numbers. It said Democratic U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer had requested such a waiver earlier in the week. According to the criminal complaint, Thompson and the ex-girlfriend, a social worker, broke up last summer. The following day, her boss received an email purporting to be from a national news organization saying she’d been pulled over for drunken driving. The harassment got worse, authorities said. She received an anonymous email with nude photos of herself and a threat to release them. Her company, a nonprofit that works to end homelessness, got faxes saying she was anti-Semitic. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children got a note saying she watched child porn. Thompson’s IP address was used for the emails, but he told police his computer had been hacked, the complaint said. The ADL said Thompson had been on its radar since he fabricated the story about Roof. According to ADL research, Thompson also claimed he wanted to dismantle the system of “racial supremacy and greedy capitalism that is stacked against us.” He said he was going to run for mayor of St. Louis to “fight back against Trumpian fascism and socio-economic terrorism.” FBI Director James Comey met with Jewish community leaders Friday to discuss the recent threats, the agency said. University City, Missouri, police Lt. Fredrick Lemons told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that detectives will question Thompson about the 154 headstones toppled last month at a Jewish cemetery there.",A local paper,1
Article6.txt,"﻿Posted December 13, 2015 09:15 pm  By  TAMMY WEBBER Associated Press ________________   Sikhs feel vulnerable, join with Muslims to combat backlash  Comments 	 Share 	  	    In this Dec. 11, 2015, photo, Darsh Singh, left, poses for a photo with his wife, Lakhpreet Kaur, in Dallas. It happens regularly: Someone sees a man with a turban and beard and hurls anti-Muslim slurs his way, or worse. Members of the Sikh religion, like Singh and his wife, also are feeling vulnerable as anti-Islamic sentiment heats up across the U.S., but instead of distancing themselves from Muslims, members of this southeast Asian religion are working with them to combat hateful rhetoric and dispel misconceptions about their respective faiths. (AP Photo/LM Otero) CHICAGO | Pardeep Kaleka spent several days after 9/11 at his father's South Milwaukee gas station, fearing that his family would be targeted by people who assumed they were Muslim. No, Kaleka explained on behalf of his father, who wore a turban and beard and spoke only in broken English, the family was Sikh, a southeast Asian religion based on equality and unrelated to Islam. But amid a new wave of anti-Islamic sentiment since the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Kaleka is vowing to take an entirely different approach. ""For us it does not matter who they're targeting,"" said Kaleka, a former Milwaukee police officer and teacher whose father was one of six people killed in 2012 when a white supremacist opened fire at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. ""This time we cannot differentiate ourselves; when hate rhetoric is being spewed we cannot be on the sidelines."" Across the U.S., Sikhs and Muslims are banding together to defend their respective religions. Someone bent on harming Muslims wouldn't understand — or care — about the distinction between the two faiths, they say, and both also deserve to live in peace. So they plan educational sessions and rallies. They successfully pushed the FBI to track hate crimes against Sikhs. They speak to lawmakers and support each other's legal action, including a lawsuit filed over a New York City police surveillance program targeting New Jersey Muslims. ""We are in this fight together,"" said Gurjot Kaur, a senior staff attorney at The Sikh Coalition, founded the night of Sept. 11. Sikhism, a monotheistic faith, was founded more than 500 years ago in Southeast Asia and has roughly 27 million followers worldwide, most of them in India. There are more than 500,000 Sikhs in the U.S. Male followers often cover their heads with turbans — which are considered sacred — and refrain from shaving their beards. Reports of bullying, harassment and vandalism against Sikhs have risen in recent weeks. Last week, a Sikh temple in Orange County, California, was vandalized, as was a truck in the parking lot by someone who misspelled the word ""Islam"" and made an obscene reference to ISIS. A Sikh woman said she recently was forced to show her breast pump before taking her seat on an airplane in Minneapolis because another passenger thought she might be a terrorist. Several Sikh football fans said they initially were not allowed into Qualcomm Stadium to watch the San Diego Chargers game against the Denver Broncos last Sunday because several of them were wearing turbans. Schoolchildren say they've been bullied. For most Sikhs, much of the backlash has been frequent stares or comments and occasional online insults. Former NCAA basketball player Darsh Singh said he has heard insults throughout his life, including recently when someone recently yelled ""Osama!"" at him as he was crossing a street in Phoenix. Then last week, a photo making the rounds on Facebook showed the former Trinity University basketball player — the first turbaned Sikh to play in the NCAA — with the caption: ""Nobody wants to guard Muhammad, he's too explosive."" A friend came to his defense with a lengthy post —saying, ""do the world a favor and educate yourself"" — which got tens of thousands of likes. ""A lot of people act out of fear or ignorance,"" said Singh. ""I don't know who started it, but whoever they are, I forgive them."" Rajinder Singh Mago, community outreach director at the Sikh Religious Society of Chicago, said it's more difficult for Sikh schoolchildren who sometimes are bullied. ""Ninety-nine percent of Americans are good ... then that one person who just came out of a tavern after a few beers, you don't know what he's thinking at that point,"" Mago said. Madihha Ahussain, a staff attorney at the national group Muslim Advocates, said people who are misinformed about both religions not only are ""blaming entire faith communities, now they're blaming multiple groups for the acts of a couple individuals."" As a result, some Sikhs have encountered violence. A Chicago-area teenager was charged with a hate crime after a September road rage incident in which he called 53-year-old Sikh taxi driver Inderjit Mukker ""Bin Laden"" and repeatedly hit him in the face, breaking his cheekbone. In 2013, a Green Bay, Wisconsin, man was charged with a hate crime for allegedly setting fire to a convenience store owned by a Sikh-American. That was less than a year after white supremacist Wade Michael Page killed six people and wounded four others at the Oak Creek temple. Kaleka said his father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, was the last person killed inside the temple, after Page broke into an office where the elder Kaleka was calling 911. Kaleka said the Muslim community reached out to Sikhs in the aftermath, and members of both faiths — along with Christians, Jews and others — are continuing to work together to combat inflammatory rhetoric. Last weekend, he spoke at a Muslim women's coalition. ""I think this is just another test and, unfortunately, I think as bad as the comments are from some politicians, it does surface some underlying issues we haven't addressed,"" in this country, he said.",A local paper,1
