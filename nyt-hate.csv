But first they need lawyers.

The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law recently began operating a hotline at 844-9-NO-HATE (844-966-4283), through which volunteers can help callers find legal representation. But beyond that, “there is no real comprehensive network around the country” to connect victims of hate crimes or harassment with lawyers, said Betsy Shuman-Moore, the director of the Hate Crime Project at the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights. In the Chicago area, she added, legal resources for hate crime victims have actually decreased in recent years.

When the perpetrator remains unidentified, as in the Khuranas’ case, a lawsuit is usually not an option. Some states, however, have funds set aside to help crime victims pay their expenses. Mr. Khurana wrote to the mayor of Cleveland, whose staff suggested he contact the Ohio attorney general’s office. The office maintains a victims’ compensation fund, but Mr. Khurana was told he was not eligible for compensation because he had not been physically injured. The office sent him a booklet titled “Picking Up the Pieces” with information about crime victims’ rights.

Sometimes, friends or family — or strangers — step in to help hate crime victims. After Cristina Alfonso-Zea was attacked last year in the parking lot outside her home in Las Vegas by assailants who hit her in the head, stole her wallet and phone and wrote slurs on her car, her friend set up a GoFundMe campaign to help her.

Ms. Alfonso-Zea, a veteran, already had post-traumatic stress disorder, which was exacerbated by the attack. The money from the campaign helped her fix her car and move away from the area where she was attacked. The campaign also helped her psychologically, she said: “It made me realize that there’s really good people out there that really care about you, even if they don’t know you.”

She wishes hate crime victims got more information on compensation funds and other resources. “In Las Vegas, they teach us about flash flooding, they teach us abandonment of a rabbit is a felony,” she said, “but at the same time they don’t really teach us about having funds like that or having a safe place that you can go to.”

Mrs. Khurana ultimately sold some of her jewelry to pay for their car expenses. The Khuranas don’t plan to move, but they are more careful when they go out in their neighborhood now, and they park their car in a different spot that costs $5 a day.

Mr. Khurana is grateful he and his wife weren’t hurt — he thinks of the shooting of two Indian immigrants, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, in Kansas in February.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/europe/chechnya-russia-attacks-gays.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Novaya Gazeta, an opposition newspaper, first reported the pogrom, saying that at least 100 gay men had been arrested and three killed in the roundup. Human Rights Watch corroborated those findings.

The sweep has been widely condemned by Western governments, the United Nations and rights groups. Activists in Russia have set up an underground network to spirit the victims out of Chechnya and to protect them from potentially violent reprisals from their families and others. The victims use assumed names in their everyday dealings.

The following account is based on interviews with Maksim, who is in his 20s, and two other gay men who were detained by Chechen security agents.

Homosexuality is taboo in Chechnya and the mostly Muslim surrounding areas of the Caucasus region in southern Russia. “This society is highly homophobic,” said Ekaterina L. Sokiryanskaya, Russia project director for the International Crisis Group and an authority on Chechnya. “Homosexuality is condemned. It is believed Islam considers it a great sin.”

Nevertheless, before the crackdown, gay men in Chechnya could at least lead social lives, if heavily closeted ones, Maksim said. They met largely in private chat rooms on social networking sites with names like the Village or What the Mountains Are Silent About.

“When two gay men meet, they don’t tell one another their true names,” Maksim said. Men met at cafes or at apartments rented for a night, he said. “Nobody suspected my sexual orientation, not even my best friends.”

The crackdown began after GayRussia, a rights group based in Moscow, applied for permits for gay pride parades in the Caucasus region, prompting counterprotests by religious groups, the men said. In Chechnya, it became something even worse — a mass “prophylactic” cleansing of homosexuals, the security service agents told the gay men as they rounded them up.

The men were held for as little as a day or as long as several weeks, according to Human Rights Watch and to interviews with gay men who later escaped the region. Some “returned to their families barely alive from beatings,” said Tanya Lokshina, Russia program director for Human Rights Watch.

Among the fatalities documented by the organization were one man who succumbed during torture and two others who died in “honor killings” by relatives after the police released them.

“Human Rights Watch has been getting numerous reports about attacks by security services under Ramzan Kadyrov’s control, and those reports are extremely disturbing,” Ms. Lokshina said. “This is another opportunity to reinforce the culture of fear.”

The Chechen authorities’ response to the global outrage over the pogrom has provoked new incredulity. In a telephone interview, Mr. Kadyrov’s spokesman, Alvi Karimov, said the reports of an anti-gay pogrom had to be false because such men did not exist in Chechnya.

“In Grozny, have you ever noticed people who, by their appearance or manners, resemble people who are oriented in the wrong way?” Mr. Karimov asked.

“A policy is developed for a problem,” he said, referring to a report that said the arrests were official policy. “I can officially say there is no policy because there is no problem. If there were a problem, there would be a policy.”

In a televised meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Wednesday, Mr. Kadyrov characterized as “libelous” news reports that the security services in Chechnya had been persecuting gay men.

And on Thursday, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told journalists that the Russian authorities had found no evidence that the Chechen police had arrested gay men.

But it quickly became clear to Maksim and the other men that the Chechen authorities were applying the same tactics used by Russia and by Mr. Kadyrov to suppress an Islamist insurgency in the region over the past decade.

Security service agents took to posing as gay men looking for dates on the Village and in other chat rooms, or persuaded those they had already captured to lure acquaintances, those arrested said in interviews.

Fear spread among gay Chechens. “If they caught him, they will get to me,” said a 20-year-old student who identified himself as Ilya and who was interviewed at a safe location outside Chechnya. Ilya fled days before the police showed up at his home, he learned later.

The authorities briefly detained another young man, who identified himself as Nohcho, after a friend informed on him during an interrogation. “I don’t blame him,” Nohcho said of the friend. “We are not heroes. We’re just gay guys. They starve you. They shock you.”

That, it seems, is essentially what happened to Maksim, who had been corresponding with his gay acquaintance for some time. “One day, he suggested we meet for a drink,” Maksim said. “And because we knew each other a long time, I did not suspect he would be capable of something like this.”

When Maksim entered the apartment where they had agreed to meet, security officers roughed him up. Five other men were already in the apartment, lured by the same ruse, he said. His account of the deception used to detain him was consistent with others documented by Human Rights Watch and with the accounts of the two other gay men interviewed separately for this article.

All six of the men in the apartment were transferred to a makeshift cell in an abandoned building, where they were tortured with electricity one by one, Maksim said.

After 11 days, he was released to a male relative, who was told that Maksim was gay. The security officers told the captives’ male relatives that, if they had any honor, they would kill the young men, Maksim and Ilya said.

Maksim’s father threatened to beat him but refrained when his son showed him the bruises he already had. Instead his father said, “I should kill you.”

Fearing for his life, Maksim turned to a gay rights group, the Russian LGBT Network, based in St. Petersburg, which has established an emergency, round-the-clock volunteer group to help gay men escape the region.

To reassure the victims they are trying to help, the activists have taken extraordinary precautions, operating virtually as a partisan cell behind enemy lines, though they have done nothing illegal under Russian law.

“These people don’t trust anybody,” said Olga Baranova, director of the Moscow Community Center, a support group for gays that is part of the volunteer network helping gay men flee Chechnya.

After arriving at the safe location outside Chechnya, several young men said they had suspected that the volunteer group was also a trap but had no other option but to accept the help, Ms. Baranova said. “They say, ‘We didn’t believe you were real,’” she said. “‘We thought this was the last effort to round up whoever was left.’”

The network bought airplane tickets for Chechen gay men, found safe houses and arranged for doctors to treat those who had been badly beaten.

“Gays in Chechnya and the North Caucasus are in lethal danger,” Igor Kochetkov, director of the Russian LGBT Network, said in a telephone interview. “People whose partners are detained have every reason to believe they will be arrested. It is very hard not to name the names under torture.”",nytimes.com,True

Dr. Prabhjot Singh, now the chair of the department of health system design and global health at the Mount Sinai Health System, felt angry and depressed after he was attacked in New York in 2005, when he was in graduate school. He reached out to mental health services at his university, but they weren’t much help, since they were geared toward people with severe psychiatric illness. When he was attacked again a few years later, his anger, depression and sense of isolation deepened. He dealt with them by throwing himself into work. He also began practicing his Sikh religion more actively, growing his beard and waking up before dawn to meditate.

Then, in 2013, he was attacked by a group of young men who called him “Osama” and “terrorist” and punched him in the face, breaking his jaw. That attack got significant media attention, and people began to email him asking for advice after they or their loved ones experienced hate crimes. The volume of recent messages has been a sign for him that hate crimes are on the rise. “I just hear it in my inbox,” he said.

Sometimes Dr. Singh can help the people who write to him, and sometimes he can’t. He sees a lack of resources for people who have been victims of hate crimes: “I don’t think there’s really a good way for people who have had this type of experience to find useful community.”

Some nonprofit groups are mobilizing to offer mental health services for people affected by hate crimes or harassment, who may have unique needs that conventional therapy doesn’t always address. Staff at the YWCA of Kalamazoo in western Michigan found that while people who had experienced hate crimes could find individual counseling in the area, which is home to many immigrants working in the agriculture industry, there were no services for people feeling the indirect effects of hate crimes against people of their race or religion, said Jessica Glynn, the director of law and policy at the YWCA. To fill the gap, the YWCA of Kalamazoo earlier this year created a support group for survivors, witnesses and others affected by hate crimes, and plans to create more groups in the area if needed.

Established a year and a half ago, the Bay Area Khalil Center has already expanded to include a second branch, and a third is in the works. In addition to support groups, the center offers individual therapy with Muslim therapists. Working with a therapist who shares their religion means patients “don’t have to start from scratch explaining things,” said Dr. Awaad.

The Maryland chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations holds free self-defense workshops and recently conducted its first training on how to respond to an active shooter. Learning preparedness skills can help people cope with anxiety and fear, said Dr. Zainab Chaudry, the council’s Maryland outreach manager. “We can’t control external factors in our environment,” she added, “but we can control how we respond.”

Since the attack in 2013, Dr. Singh has discovered that little research or advice exists to help doctors identify and treat patients who have experienced hate crimes. He’s begun work on a guide, perhaps drawing on techniques developed to treat survivors of domestic and sexual violence.

Dr. Singh saw the election of President Trump as the latest symptom of a deep national confusion that he’s not sure how to address. But he takes comfort in his Sikh practice: “finding that stillness, finding that discipline to remember that we know each other far more than we say we do. We are all connected.”

On April 1, a leading opposition newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, confirmed those reports, citing Russian federal law enforcement officials, who blamed the local authorities.

Dozens of men are said to have been rounded up, but precise numbers — including a death toll — are not available.

Since 2007, Chechnya — a mountainous republic within the Russian Federation and the site of a long-running insurgency that Russia eventually crushed — has been led by a strongman, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, who has been granted significant leeway in exchange for his allegiance to the Kremlin.

In restive Muslim regions in southern Russia, Mr. Putin has empowered local leaders to enforce their interpretation of traditional Muslim values, partly in an effort to co-opt Islamist extremism, which has largely been driven underground.

A spokesman for Mr. Kadyrov issued a chilling denial on April 1, after the initial reports surfaced. “You cannot arrest or repress people who just don’t exist in the republic,” the spokesman, Alvi Karimov, told the Interfax news agency. “If such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return.”

The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on April 3 that he could not confirm the newspaper’s account but added: “This is something for law enforcement to deal with. This is not on the Kremlin’s agenda.”

According to Novaya Gazeta, the persecution intensified after a group based in Moscow, GayRussia.ru, applied for permits to stage gay-pride parades in four cities in the North Caucasus region.

The group did not apply for a permit in Chechnya, but it did in another Muslim area in the region, Kabardino-Balkaria. The mere application there — denied, as usual — prompted an anti-gay counterdemonstration.

“In Chechnya, the command was given for a ‘prophylactic sweep,’ and it went as far as real murders,” Novaya Gazeta reported. As part of the sweep, investigators posed as men looking for dates or sex. Gay men have begun deleting online accounts or even fleeing the region, the newspaper reported.

The United Nations experts urged the authorities to end the persecution, saying that Chechens were “living in a climate of fear fueled by homophobic speeches by local authorities.” They also demanded that the authorities immediately release all detainees, thoroughly investigate the anti-gay campaign and hold the persecutors accountable.

The experts condemned statements by Chechen officials suggesting that gay people should be hunted down and killed. “The Russian Federation must officially state that it does not tolerate any form of incitement to violence, social stigmatization of homosexuality or hate speech, and does not condone discrimination or violence against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity,” their statement said.

There was little suggestion that Moscow would give the experts’ warnings much heed. Russia has been widely criticized for cracking down on the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. In 2013, a law criminalized giving minors materials promoting “nontraditional” sexual relationships — a statute that has been used to justify the arrests of gay rights activists.

Amsterdam, the capital, has been a haven for sexual minorities for centuries, and it has marketed itself as the “gay capital of Europe.” Homosexuality was removed from the Dutch criminal code in 1811, and the Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize gay marriage, with the first ceremonies in 2001.

Gay rights are supported across the political spectrum in the Netherlands. The attack comes as the country has been grappling with growing anti-immigrant sentiment, fueled in part by the far-right leader Geert Wilders, who has railed against immigrants and Muslims in particular, saying that “Islamization” is a threat to European liberal values, including gay rights and women’s rights.

The populist party of Mr. Wilders, who likens himself to Donald J. Trump, came second in recent Dutch elections. He is an ideological heir of Pim Fortuyn, a right-wing politician who derided Islam, immigration and multiculturalism, and who was openly gay. Mr. Fortuyn was killed in 2002, days before his party placed second in national elections.

The Dutch news media quoted Gerald Roethof, a lawyer for one of the suspects, as saying that the couple had instigated the fight by acting aggressively toward the teenagers, an accusation the two vehemently denied. Mr. Roethof also denied that bolt cutters had been used, or that the men were targeted because they were gay. But he said his client had acknowledged punching one of the men in the mouth.

Then suddenly six to eight youths set upon them, he said, and “before I knew it, I was on the ground fighting with three men on top of me.”

After the attack, which Mr. Vernes-Sewratan, 35, recounted on his Facebook page, Dutch politicians, actors, police officers, soldiers and athletes took to the streets, holding hands. Hundreds of people marched through the streets of Amsterdam to show their support for gay rights. The expressions of support grew after the journalist Barbara Berend appealed on Twitter for men, whether straight or gay, to walk hand in hand.

Dozens heeded her call and posted photographs of themselves doing just that, often with the hashtag #allemannenhandinhand (all men holding hands). Two high-profile politicians — Alexander Pechtold, leader of the liberal-democratic party D66, and Wouter Koolmees, a lawmaker in the party — showed up for coalition talks on Monday holding hands.

COC Netherlands, an advocacy group for gay rights based in Amsterdam, said the number of reported cases of violence against gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people had increased to 1,600 in 2015 from about 400 in 2009. Of the 1,600, nine resulted in convictions for discrimination-related offenses, including hate crimes.

Now, what has been called a hate crime by the police has turned a neighborhood they love into one they fear.

“I can’t go out and see too many people,” Nayra, 31, said. “If I have appointments, I’ll take a taxi and come back home. I don’t want to see anybody. If I do, I freeze. If I go outside to smoke and I hear a man’s voice, I panic.”

Patrick Omeara, 38, of Oakdale, N.Y., was arrested and faces various charges, including assault as a hate crime. He could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Howard Turman, did not respond to several voice messages requesting comment. The case is in the pretrial stage, and the next court date is scheduled for Tuesday.

Jackson Heights has come a long way since skinheads lured Julio Rivera, a gay man, into a schoolyard and killed him. That 1990 attack galvanized activists and residents, and led to the establishment of the borough’s gay pride parade and a political club that has promoted laws and policies helping gay, lesbian and transgender people. Yet the attacks on trans women — three this year and 16 in 2016, according to local advocates — are an unsettling reminder of the work still to be done.

“People have this idea that New York City is free of violence and progressive,” said Shelby Chestnut, director of community organizing and public advocacy at the New York City Anti-Violence Project. “But violence is still occurring against many marginalized communities, and the trans community is deeply affected by that.

“We need to push the public to pay attention to trans issues and see it as a civil rights issue,” she continued. “We are in this moment in society where violence and hatred is emerging in a number of communities, and it exists in New York.”

Nationally, Ms. Chestnut said, transgender women are being killed in greater numbers than any other segment of the L.G.B.T. community. This year alone, she said, there have been seven such murders: Six victims were African-American, and one was Native American.

Advocates said these instances of violence were not isolated but the result of a combination of factors that leave African-American and Latina trans women vulnerable. Harassed in public, rejected by their families and uneasy in school or homeless shelters for men, they are left to fend for themselves and are at a higher risk of becoming victims of violence, advocates said. And the political debate over unauthorized immigrants has left many fearful of speaking out.

“The biggest challenge in working with transgender people is they often don’t have the self-esteem to think they are worth seeking support or help for themselves,” said City Councilman Daniel Dromm, who represents Jackson Heights.

“There is also distrust in going to the authorities, especially the police,” he said. “In the past they have gone there and faced harassment, even at night when they were coming home from the bars. That distrust causes hesitation.”

Nayra and Gabriela encountered some of this after the attack. Although the police who responded were helpful, they said, the detectives who followed up with them at the hospital made them uncomfortable by asking the same questions repeatedly, as if they did not believe them. Nor did the detectives speak Spanish, even though the women, who are Puerto Rican, have limited English proficiency.

Since that encounter in the hospital, the women said, they have yet to hear back from the police.

“We need more laws to ensure the security of trans women,” said Bianey Garcia, a transgender organizer with Make the Road New York. “We don’t need more police. We want the police who are already there to pay more attention to these cases.”

Until then, Gabriela and Nayra are paying extra attention.

“We never had anything happen to us before,” Gabriela said. “Now I walk with fear, like any woman. But now I pay more attention to what I hear around me. I notice more. I look at every little thing. If a couple of people pass by too close to me on the street, I keep walking, wait a little and then look back at them quickly to see if anyone is following me.”",nytimes.com,True

Harassment has long been a problem on subways, in part because many strangers are packed together on narrow cars, sometimes for long periods. “Even in a park, you’re not going to be quite that close together,” said Emily May, the executive director of the anti-harassment group Hollaback.

But since the election, the group has received nearly double the usual number of reports of harassment on the subway, and more than usual involve racist, Islamophobic or anti-immigrant comments.

The New York City Commission on Human Rights was concerned enough about postelection incidents on subways that it organized an outreach day in December, with handouts on religious discrimination and reporting harassment distributed at eight subway stations. Overall, the commission saw a 480 percent increase in claims of discriminatory harassment between 2015 and 2016.

For Sarah Dodds-Brown, the shock of being singled out for a racist attack was compounded by the fact that no one stepped in to help her. She was riding the train to work one morning in mid-January when a man began elbowing her in the back. When Ms. Dodds-Brown, who is black, asked him to stop, he said, “Obama’s term is over.” Then the man, who was Asian-American, delivered an angry rant that included a comment about “self-righteous slaves.”

“I wouldn’t have expected somebody to confront him, necessarily,” she said. But even someone making eye contact with the man, she said, would have sent the message that his behavior was unacceptable.

Harassment can be more traumatic when no one steps in to help, Ms. May said, and people who have experienced it are more likely to wish a bystander had spoken up than that police had gotten involved.

Two fellow passengers stepped in to help Ms. Heir after the incident on the L train. One woman tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she was all right. “That meant something,” Ms. Heir said, “because when you’re a minority, you’re so used to just experiencing things on your own.”

Another woman reported the incident to a police officer at a subway station.

Anyone who witnesses or experiences harassment on the subway can report it to the city’s human rights commission by calling (718) 722-3131. Communities Against Hate, a partnership of 11 civil rights organizations, operates a hotline at 844-9-NO-HATE (844-966-4283), where people who have been harassed can get information about resources like legal services and counseling. Hollaback and other organizations offer bystander intervention training to help people learn what to do if they see someone being harassed.

Ms. Dodds-Brown reported what happened to her on the subway to the Documenting Hate project, a group of organizations — including The New York Times opinion section — tracking hate crimes and harassment since the election. She also posted about the incident on Facebook and talked to her children and their teachers about it. She wanted people to understand how to protect themselves and others, she said. “We actually all have a responsibility to create the society we want.”

His name was Timothy Caughman. He was from Manhattan and was 66 when he died. The police say he was stabbed on Monday night by a 28-year-old man who had come to New York City from Baltimore looking to kill black men. It was Mr. Caughman’s misfortune to be male and black when the stranger with a 26-inch sword approached on Ninth Avenue near 36th Street, around the corner from where he lived.

We don’t know much else about Mr. Caughman, but the persona he shared with the world on Twitter was that of a man of buoyant outlook and varied interests, who was amused by many things, fond of music and movies, captivated by celebrities. His profile says he was a “can and bottle recycler” and collector of autographs. “I would love to visit California,” it says. A selfie shows him waiting in line to vote and declaring his love for America. His Twitter feed is generous with condolences for celebrities: for Chuck Berry, Joni Sledge, Al Jarreau. On St. Patrick’s Day he retweeted a photograph of the athletes of Team Ireland competing in the Special Olympics World Winter Games in Austria.

Mr. Caughman’s death was, by the police account, a murderous act of terror in the heart of America’s biggest city, at a time of white-hot fear of radical violence.

On Thursday, President Trump sent prayers and condolences via Twitter to the family and friends of Kurt Cochran, an American killed in a terrorist rampage in London. He called Mr. Cochran “a great American.” He did not tweet about his fellow New Yorker, Mr. Caughman.

Mr. Trump is easily provoked to outrage. But he seems unable to summon that emotion on behalf of Mr. Caughman, who was poor and black and lived in a shelter for homeless people with H.I.V. and AIDS. Maybe he’s not that kind of president. So the next best thing is to turn to his predecessor Barack Obama, who confronted senseless violence with healing words again and again. In January he said this, to a Chicago TV news station:

“We don’t benefit from pretending that racism doesn’t exist and hate doesn’t exist. We don’t benefit from not talking about it. The fact that these things are being surfaced means we can solve them. But over all, what I’ve seen as president in traveling around the country is, particularly, the next generation, young people, their appreciation of people who are different than them, come from different places, have different backgrounds, my daughter’s generation, they’re far more sophisticated about race, far more tolerant and embracing of diversity. So I think that over the long arc, America will keep on getting better.”

Yet suspicion and hatred are stoked daily; intolerance is federal policy; white nationalists serve in the White House. Mr. Obama is right to believe in a tolerant America — but with crimes like these, keeping faith in that vision can be difficult over the long arc that seems to get longer every day.",nytimes.com,True

What followed the murder of the two police officers in 2014 bore no resemblance to such a measured response.

With Mr. Brinsley’s suicide, public figures quickly looked for people to blame. The head of the police union said Mayor Bill de Blasio had “blood on his hands.” A former governor of New York also blamed the mayor, and added the United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr. A former mayor blamed President Obama, even though the president had condemned the murders, called on the public to support the police, and solicited prayers for the officers’ families.

Now comes the matter of a purported white supremacist who, prosecutors say, not only used a sword to slaughter an innocent man, but had plans to kill more in Times Square.

The usual suspects on matters of terrorism have not been rushing to condemn this week’s murder of Mr. Caughman.

President Trump has not yet said anything about this horrific crime. Figuring out which politicians are more virtuous based on the speed of their denunciations of heinous acts is a fool’s game; nothing is repaired by pious news releases or rants on cable television and social media.

Still, the sharp sensitivity of the president to any crime charged to an immigrant is striking when compared with his seeming indifference to attacks on minorities, or his own verbal forays. He was notably slow off the mark when an Indian engineer was killed in Kansas by a man who questioned his immigration status. After David Duke, the former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, supported his candidacy, Mr. Trump said he did not know who Mr. Duke was, despite a long, unambiguous public record to the contrary.

During the campaign, Mr. Trump re-tweeted false statistics from a white supremacist about black-on-white crime. He said Mexico was sending rapists and criminals to the United States, although studies show that immigrants, both with and without permission to be in the country, are more law-abiding than those born here. For the better part of five years, Mr. Trump claimed that President Obama was not born in America and that his investigators had evidence of it. He had none.

It is beyond conception that any elected official in the United States, from Mr. Trump down, could choose to appear indifferent to race-based attacks. Much remains to be learned about the man accused of this week’s crime; the authorities say his race hatred goes back a decade.

A judge ordered the suspect, who has not been charged, held until at least March 30 and ordered a medical examination. His father was ordered held for eight days, on suspicion that he might have been aware of the threats, or even been involved.

The father denies any knowledge of the threats, his lawyer said. The judge imposed an order of silence forbidding the Israeli authorities to release either man’s name.

The teenager, who was born in Israel, has a brain tumor that can affect his cognitive abilities and lead to “irrational” behavior, his lawyer, Galit Bash, said. She would not say whether her client, who she said did not have a criminal record, had admitted or denied involvement.

Ms. Bash and the father’s lawyer, Eran Rau, who are both from the Office of the Israeli Public Defender, said the young man was an only child who lived with his parents and had been home-schooled, which is unusual in Israel. While most Israelis are drafted into military service, the teenager was rejected, which Ms. Bash said was because of his medical condition. Israeli news media reported that she had said in court that he had the tumor since he was 14.

The father, an engineer in his early 50s, was cooperating with investigators, Mr. Rau said. He said his client, who also has no criminal record, was concerned primarily with his son’s welfare, given his medical condition.

“This all seems very strange and preliminary to me,” Mr. Rau said.

Israeli news outlets reported that when the teenager was arrested, he tried to grab an officer’s gun. In his brief court appearance, the suspect, wearing khaki cargo pants, bowed his head and pulled up his shirt to conceal his face.

On Thursday morning, after months of investigation and waves of turmoil and panic, the Federal Bureau of Investigation held a conference call with leaders of Jewish organizations to discuss the surprising denouement to the investigation. As the news spread, it drew mixed reactions from Jewish leaders and anti-discrimination groups who tried to make sense of it.

Joel Dinkin, the executive vice president of the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center of Houston, said that it was “a little bit perplexing from the standpoint of the fact that it’s somebody Jewish.”

Jonathan A. Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, cautioned that many of the people responsible for anti-Semitic threats, vandalism and “a torrent of abuse online” remained at large. And even the threats attributed to the Israeli teenager, he said, should still be considered acts of anti-Semitism.

“The motive may have been unclear, but the impact was crystal clear,” Mr. Greenblatt said. “These were acts that terrorized a community just because of their faith.”

Critics of President Trump have accused him of playing down hatred and violence against minority groups and charged that his anti-immigrant remarks are fueling conflict. He did not publicly condemn the anti-Semitic threats and vandalism until Feb. 21, weeks after Jewish groups began calling on him to speak out. On Feb. 28, in a meeting with state attorneys general, Mr. Trump suggested that some of the threats and vandalism could be a politically motivated effort to “make people look bad,” rather than actual expressions of bias, according to people who took part in the meeting.

The authorities said the person who made the calls had sent them through the internet and used sophisticated software to disguise his location and camouflage his voice, which slowed the investigation. When the Israeli police searched the suspect’s house, investigators confiscated computers, an antenna and other equipment.

An American official said it appeared that the man had used Tor, widely available anonymity software that masks a computer’s true whereabouts by routing its internet traffic through various points around the globe. Many people use Tor, which is managed by a nonprofit digital privacy group, including those conducting illicit business and activists trying to avoid government censorship or surveillance.

“The investigation began in several countries at the same time, in which dozens of threatening calls were received at public places, events, synagogues and community buildings that caused panic and disrupted events and activities in various organizations,” the Israeli police said in a statement.

The F.B.I. worked closely with the Israeli authorities on the investigation, starting in September — months before American organizations began to note a surge in threats to American targets, according to Cary Gleicher, the bureau’s top agent in Israel.

Some of the earliest American targets of bomb threats were schools, centers and museums in Alaska, Florida and New York that were affiliated with Chabad-Lubavitch, an Orthodox Jewish movement, according to a Chabad official. The movement did not publicize the threats, which received little or no news coverage.

Mr. Gleicher said he had met in early March in Washington with James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, who asked about efforts to find the person making the threatening calls, and made it clear that he had “great interest in getting this thing done.” In mid-March, Mr. Comey met with Jewish leaders at bureau headquarters to brief them on the investigation.

“I left with a level of confidence that they were definitively making strides,” said Jerry B. Silverman, the chief executive of the Jewish Federations of North America. “It was clear that they were moving at a very rapid pace.”

The American-Israeli cooperation intensified last week, when the F.B.I. sent 14 people — both agents and technical experts — to Israel to assist in the investigation, Mr. Gleicher said in an interview from Israel.

“This was a big deal,” he said, adding that it had taken the resources of both countries to get “across the finish line.”

“Monday was the eureka moment,” he said, when investigators figured out who was making the calls.

In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who described the threats as “hate crimes,” said, “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate the targeting of any community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs.”",nytimes.com,True
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/us/joey-meek-dylann-roof-charleston-church-shooting.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Mr. Meek’s lawyer, Deborah B. Barbier, expressed concern that her client would be forced to spend his sentence in solitary confinement because of security risks. Judge Gergel said the federal Bureau of Prisons could be trusted to protect him.

“It’s an odd, inverse logic that I should not incarcerate him because inmates think so lowly of him,” the judge said.

Mr. Meek, 22, pleaded guilty last April to two federal counts related to the truthfulness of his responses to the F.B.I. in interviews shortly after the shooting on June 17, 2015 — misprision of a felony and making a false statement to a law enforcement officer. Misprision refers to the failure to report a known crime.

The government did not prosecute Mr. Meek for failing to disclose knowledge of Mr. Roof’s plans to attack the church, although it asserted in court filings that his silence “did deprive law enforcement of the opportunity to intervene.”

During a night of drinking and drug use about a week before the shootings, Mr. Roof told Mr. Meek that he wanted to kill black people at a historic African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston in order to start a race riot, according to F.B.I. summaries of interviews with him. Mr. Meek was concerned enough to hide Mr. Roof’s handgun after he fell asleep but later returned it and did not report the threat to law enforcement.

“Certainly defendant’s failure to make an earlier report is tragic and deeply regrettable, but his failure to report was not a violation of federal criminal law,” Judge Gergel wrote last week in an order that denied prosecutors’ request to give Mr. Meek a longer term than recommended in sentencing guidelines.

Ms. Barbier said in a presentencing filing that it was “hypocritical and disingenuous” for prosecutors to suggest that Mr. Meek was somehow to blame for the killings. “Joey’s failure to appreciate the seriousness of Roof’s statements is not unusual in today’s shock value culture,” she wrote.

In court on Tuesday, a defense witness said Mr. Meek’s connection to the Charleston massacre would make him a “high-value target” in prison. “He’ll have to be kept separate from other inmates — not because of what he did, but because he has some relationship to a heinous crime,” said the witness, James Aiken, a former warden for the South Carolina prison system.

The case against Mr. Meek matters both as a lesson about reporting suspicions and for the insight he provides into Mr. Roof, who represented himself at times at trial and blocked the admission of any evidence about his background or psychology. As a result, the trial in December and January, which ended in a death sentence for Mr. Roof, provided little information about what may have incited him to act so violently on his racist beliefs.

Mr. Meek has said in various law enforcement interviews and court appearances that he first met Mr. Roof, who grew up near Columbia, S.C., in middle school. They largely lost touch when Mr. Roof moved away but reconnected via Facebook on May 22, 2015, less than a month before the massacre. Mr. Roof began hanging out at the trailer where Mr. Meek lived with his girlfriend and other family members.

One night in early June, after consuming vodka, marijuana and cocaine, Mr. Roof told Mr. Meek of his support for segregation and his desire to “do something big and put South Carolina on the map,” Mr. Meek told the F.B.I. He said that he had been planning the attack for six months and that he hoped to carry it out on a Wednesday because fewer people would be at church. He told Mr. Meek he would then kill himself.

Mr. Meek dismissed the seriousness and did not notify the authorities.

Mr. Meek learned about the shootings soon after Mr. Roof opened fire and discussed his fears with a friend, Dalton Tyler, telling him not to contact the police. Mr. Tyler held off that night. But the next morning, as a photograph of Mr. Roof from a church security camera began circulating, Mr. Tyler became the first person to call a police tip line and identify the gunman, according to a search warrant. Mr. Roof was arrested later that morning in North Carolina with the murder weapon in the back seat.

In his initial F.B.I. interview, Mr. Meek denied having known of Mr. Roof’s plans and said Mr. Roof had not spoken of a target for his attack, according to Assistant United States Attorney Julius N. Richardson.

But in a second interview, Mr. Meek admitted that he had lied, according to an F.B.I. synopsis of the session. He also admitted that on the night of the shootings, after concluding that Mr. Roof was responsible for the attack, he told others not to contact law enforcement.

In his conversations with investigators, Mr. Meek described Mr. Roof as a shy former altar boy who did not have many friends but was not a social misfit. His parents, who were divorced, lived in houses with swimming pools and gave him most anything he wanted, Mr. Meek said. He did not perceive Mr. Roof as depressed or as having an anger problem.

When Mr. Meek was first charged and agreed to a plea deal, the expectation was that he would testify in Mr. Roof’s trial about the killer’s premeditation and planning. But the government’s case on that score was strong without Mr. Meek, and neither side called him as a witness. Mr. Richardson declined to comment on Tuesday, as did the relatives of Mr. Roof’s victims who attended the sentencing.

Mr. Meek, who will remain free on bond until he reports to prison, has told the authorities that he thinks about the carnage every day and that he has trouble sleeping nearly two years after Mr. Roof’s killing spree.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/opinion/george-soros-when-hate-surges.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"President Trump has wasted no time in cracking down on immigration. He pledged to build a wall, hire 15,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents and speedily deport millions of undocumented immigrants. He justified these actions by claiming that immigrants regularly flout the “rule of law and pose a threat.” In his first speech to Congress, he directed the Department of Homeland Security to create a new office — Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or Voice — dedicated to helping victims of crimes perpetrated by “removable aliens.”

I am an immigrant and an American citizen, and, as a philanthropist, have supported migrants all over the world for more than 30 years. Based on my experience and the facts, the president’s approach to immigrants is just wrong — and a new round of court injunctions against Mr. Trump’s latest proposed travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries suggests many in the federal judiciary agree. It does nothing to make America safer, while whipping up emotions against immigrants that have translated into an alarming surge in hate incidents all across our nation. My heart goes out to the victims of violence, whatever the source. But in the name of protecting the population from a relatively minor source of concern, he is branding all immigrants as criminals.

Contrary to Mr. Trump’s claims, immigrants commit significantly less crime than native-born citizens. This has been borne out in study after study, using a wide range of methodologies, dating back decades. According to the nonpartisan American Immigration Council, the percentage of the population that is foreign-born grew to 13.1 percent from 7.9 percent between 1990 and 2013. F.B.I. data shows that the violent crime rate dropped 48 percent during that time and today remains near historic lows. A recent study by the Journal on Ethnicity in Criminal Justice shows that immigrants actually drive down crime rates in the neighborhoods where they live.

But targeting immigrants and minorities with false and prejudicial rhetoric, as Mr. Trump has done during the campaign and in the early weeks of his presidency, has spurred a surge in hate acts against them. The Southern Poverty Law Center found that hate incidents reported in the first few weeks following Mr. Trump’s victory were at levels normally seen over a six-month period. No community appears safe from this rash of hate — with reports like school bullying against Muslim children, stories of Latinos being harassed on the street and told to “go back to your country,” attacks on blacks and gays, and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries. This is a country that prides itself on neighbors looking out for one another. In Donald Trump’s America, we are increasingly at one another’s throats.

Mr. Maas has been a vocal critic of how companies treat online content that violates the country’s strict rules on hate speech.

“We must increase the pressure on social networks,” he said in a statement announcing the proposed legislation.

“This will set binding standards for how companies running social networks must handle complaints and require them to delete criminal content,” Mr. Maas said of the proposal.

The yearlong study noted that while the two companies eventually erased nearly all illegal hate speech, in January and February, Facebook managed to delete 39 percent in the time frame sought by the German authorities and Twitter 1 percent. Google’s YouTube video service fared the best, taking down within 24 hours 90 percent of all content flagged.

Since September, the figure for Facebook has fallen by seven percentage points, while Twitter’s takedown rate has not changed. The issue has taken on new urgency as Germany gears up for parliamentary elections in September.

Tech companies deny playing fast and loose with national hate speech laws, saying they have taken down illegal material when it has been flagged by users. They also argue, however, that there is a fine line between complying with a country’s rules and outright censorship.

Germany, where it is illegal to promote Nazi ideology or to deny the Holocaust, has been at the center of the debate about what can be published on social media platforms and who is responsible for such content.

What the house’s residents did after the spray-painted slur first appeared caused as much of a stir as the graffiti itself. The residents, Heather Lindsay, who is white, and Lexene Charles, who is black, defied a directive by the city to cover it up because they wanted to make a point publicly about intolerance.

The slur was discovered on the Saturday before Martin Luther King’s Birthday. After it had been up for three weeks, the city issued a citation for blight and warned the couple that they faced a fine of $100 a day.

President Trump has made an immigration crackdown one of the centerpieces of his young administration, including a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries that is currently the subject of litigation.

On Tuesday night, Mr. Trump, speaking before a joint session of Congress, decried the Kansas shootings and the recent desecration of two Jewish cemeteries, saying that the country “stands united in condemning hate and evil.”

The president had earlier been criticized for not directly addressing the shooting. Last week, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, called the episode “tragic” but rejected any link between Mr. Trump’s policy agenda and anti-immigrant violence as “absurd.”

On Tuesday, the White House issued a statement condemning the shooting as “an act of racially motivated hatred.”

“I want to reiterate the president condemns these or any other racially or religiously motivated attacks in the strongest terms,” Sarah Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, told CNN. “They have no place in our country.”",nytimes.com,True

Several years later, I left a career in software engineering to become a writer. I do not think I would have had the courage to do that in India. In America, a profligate waste of an education did not seem so outlandish.

America was where I lived alone for the first time, in a little studio apartment with a cracked bathtub. America was a place, far away from the watchful eyes of aunts, uncles and neighbors, where it was possible to indulge in curious passions — bartending classes, poetry groups, quail hunting, sex. There were slurs and snide comments about smelling like curry, but it never crossed my mind that America needed to be made great again, because I had already been seduced by its own conviction in its greatness. Its projection of greatness had always been its most successful export.

Now that is changing. The country that taught me the meaning of privacy is considering demanding Facebook passwords at the border. From the outside it feels less like a darker country than like a more sullen one — one half of it apologetic, the other half suspicious. I am almost nostalgic for the naïve innocence of that other America I knew, where pleasant middle-aged women would tell me about a Dr. Patel from Mumbai and ask if I knew him. That America came with a sense of curiosity. The America I see now is shrunken, scared of its own shadow despite its bluster.

Growing up in India, we didn’t question the brain drain of our best and brightest (and even our second- and third-bests) to America. It was the natural order of things. President Trump’s new vision for America is suddenly forcing us to reconsider that assumption.

It’s too late for Srinivas Kuchibhotla, but somewhere out there young men like him are wondering if the American dream itself can be outsourced. Mr. Kuchibhotla’s mother has told reporters she does not want to let her younger son return to America. The father of Alok Madasani, his friend who was wounded in the shooting, said, “I appeal to all parents in India not to send their children to the U.S. in the present circumstances.”

Perhaps an unwelcoming America is not such a bad thing for the rest of the world. Now an Iranian can stand at the Oscars ceremony and lecture the United States on human rights.

The body of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, the 32-year-old software engineer fatally shot in the Olathe, Kan., bar, was expected to arrive by Monday in Hyderabad, a technology hub where immigration to the United States has long been viewed as the surest path to success.

Indians were relatively welcoming of Mr. Trump’s victory, and many here express admiration for his business empire and promised crackdown on terrorism. But even before Wednesday’s shootings, that optimism had been diluted by fears that America might no longer welcome immigrants.

India is second only to China as a feeder to American colleges, with around 165,000 students enrolled in the 2015-16 school year, according to the Institute of International Education. Indians are the largest recipients of temporary skilled worker visas, known as H-1B visas, which the Trump administration intends to cut back. And close to half a million Indians, who mostly went to the United States legally as students or tourists or on work visas, have stayed on after their visas expired, the Pew Research Center estimates.

Ill treatment of Indian immigrants has, in the past, caused serious damage to bilateral relationships. In 2009 and 2010, reports of racially motivated crimes against Indian students in Australia set off demonstrations outside the Australian Embassy in New Delhi, where Australia’s prime minister was burned in effigy. After that, the number of Indians applying for student visas plunged by nearly half, with severe costs to Australian educational institutions.

The diplomatic effect of the shootings in Kansas has been muted so far. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not commented on them, though the subject will certainly be raised this week, along with the thorny issue of curtailing H-1B visas, when Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visits Washington.

Some Indians who had planned to go to the United States said they were hesitating. Manavi Das, who is considering several universities, said she was “constantly looking to see if the school is in a red state, or has witnessed a shooting in recent times.

“After a certain event in November,” she said, “I have found my apprehensions turned up a notch.”

Sunny Choudhary, 23, said he had decided not to apply to graduate engineering programs in the United States, because “recent conditions, they are turning into, I think, hostile conditions.” After Mr. Trump was elected, he added, “my parents said: ‘No, you should not go there. Now we won’t let you go there.’ ”

He said that, like many of his friends, he had narrowed his search to Europe.

And some Indian parents could use their persuasive talents to encourage their children to return home. “For this four-year period, after the transfer of regimes, I think Indians can come back and serve their country,” said Suguna Kadiyala, 73, whose daughter has been in the United States for 20 years.

Nageswara Rao, 71, whose son and daughter work in the software sector in the United States, said he was “not much worried,” though he does dispense regular advice on safety measures.

“It is always better to keep away from bars,” he said. His children are safe, he added, “because they don’t go to these bars where white people are more.”

The affidavit said Mr. McDowell wrote on Facebook Messenger that he was looking for an “iron,” which can mean a gun, and about a week later he met an undercover agent. In their conversations, the affidavit said, Mr. McDowell “indicated he sought a way to conduct an attack on nonwhites without getting caught” and said he wanted to do something on a large scale and write on a building, “In the spirit of Dylann Roof.”

The affidavit said Mr. McDowell wanted to buy a .40-caliber Glock handgun and hollow-point ammunition. The undercover agent arranged to meet with Mr. McDowell, who agreed to pay $109 for the gun and ammunition. He was arrested soon afterward.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the Australian authorities now say, gangs of teenagers in Sydney hunted gay men for sport, sometimes forcing them off the cliffs to their deaths. But the police, many of whom had a reputation for hostility toward gay men, often carried out perfunctory investigations that overlooked the possibility of homicide, former officials and police officers say.

Now the police in New South Wales, the state that includes Sydney, are reviewing the deaths of 88 men between 1976 and 2000 to determine whether they should be classified as anti-gay hate crimes.

About 30 of the cases remain unsolved, and the police have not said how many of the killings were tied to gangs. About a dozen victims were found dead at the bottom of cliffs or in the sea, the police say.

The review and the inquest into Mr. Johnson’s death are casting light on a shocking chapter of Sydney’s history, one that some say has yet to be fully revealed.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“We can now see that predators were attacking gay men,” said Ted Pickering, who was the police minister for New South Wales in the late 1980s. “And they were doing it with the almost-certain knowledge that the police would not have gone after them. That was the police culture of the day.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

No new arrests have been made in connection with the killings since the review began in 2013, and the police declined to discuss the open investigations. In many of the cases under review, the police said, relevant evidence had not been collected at the time or has since been lost.

“While the review is a difficult task because we can’t rewrite history, we know it is important we do everything we can to ensure the best outcomes in the future,” said Tony Crandell, an acting assistant commissioner for the New South Wales Police Force.

But others have suggested that the review, which aims to determine which cases may involve bias but not to solve them, is not a sufficient response.

“It may be tempting for the police to concentrate on merely relabeling crimes rather than doing fresh detective work to solve them,” said Stephen Tomsen, a criminologist at Western Sydney University.

Sydney is a more tolerant city than it was decades ago, and critics say that police attitudes have changed considerably. Uniformed officers now march in Sydney’s annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade, which drew a quarter-million spectators last year and was attended for the first time by a prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull.

But if the laws were changing slowly in the 1980s — New South Wales decriminalized sex between men only in 1984 — society, including the police, was even slower to do so.

“The police culture in Australia up to the early 1990s was hostile to gay men,” Michael Kirby, a retired High Court justice who served during that period, wrote in an email. “They were basically considered antisocial, low-level criminals and lowlife types who did disgusting things and should not be surprised that they got injured and even killed.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Justice Kirby, who is gay, added, “I do not believe that this extended to a general conspiracy to back off professional investigations of murder.” Rather, he said, there was “an attitude of complacency and indifference. Certainly not the usual motivation of energy to track down the murderers.”

Researchers who have studied the matter say the gangs were loose alliances of young men, teenage boys and sometimes girls who looked for victims to harass and assault at Sydney’s so-called gay beats — places where gay men were known to meet, including secluded spots on the cliffs. The gang members called it “poofter bashing.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“There was a series of gangs,” said Stephen Page, a former New South Wales detective who reopened some of the cases years later. “They wouldn’t just hit one beat, they’d be aware of all of them.”

Few victims would have gone to the police, Professor Tomsen said. Most gay men were closeted, and many would have feared being assaulted by the police themselves. After the city’s first gay Mardi Gras parade was broken up by the police in 1978, some marchers were beaten in their jail cells.

“Any gay who was attacked would be seen as a foolish risk-taker if they reported that attack to police,” Professor Tomsen said.

Still, there were some arrests and prosecutions. In 1990, a Thai man was attacked with a hammer at the top of a cliff and fell off the edge. Three teenagers were arrested and convicted of murder.

According to a report by Sue Thompson, a former state-appointed liaison between the New South Wales police and gays, one of the assailants told the police, “The easiest thing with a cliff is just herding them over the edge.”

The idea that the killing was part of a pattern was not seriously pursued until years later. In 2000, Mr. Page, spurred by letters from a grieving mother, reopened the case of Ross Warren, a 25-year-old television news anchor who disappeared in 1989.

Mr. Warren’s body was never found, though his car keys were discovered in a rock ledge. The police concluded that he had accidentally fallen into the harbor. But Mr. Page found the original investigation had been cursory at best.

“There was no crime scene, no evidence, and no witnesses to Ross Warren’s disappearance,” he said.

Mr. Page began looking into similar cases. In 2005, an inquest concluded that Mr. Warren had been murdered, another man had been pushed or thrown from a cliff, and there was a strong possibility that a third man had been, too.

“This was a grossly inadequate and shameful investigation,” Magistrate Jacqueline Milledge, a deputy state coroner, said of the police handling of Mr. Warren’s death.

In all three cases, she said, the police had failed to account for the possibility of homicide, even though men attacked in the same area who did go to the police had “told of hearing their assailants threatening to throw them off the cliff face.” The three killings remain unsolved.

When Steve Johnson learned that such cases were being revisited in Sydney, he felt he finally had a possible explanation for his younger brother’s death. Mr. Johnson had looked out for Scott since childhood, when their parents divorced, and he considered suicide impossible.

“This was my brother, the person I was closest to, my soul mate,” Mr. Johnson, 57, said in December, outside the Sydney courtroom where the inquest began.

Scott Johnson had moved to Australia to be with his partner and was pursuing his doctorate at Australian National University in Canberra. He was a “virtuoso” mathematician, a “brilliant but remarkably gentle and unassuming presence,” according to Richard Zeckhauser, a Harvard economist who once wrote a paper with him.

Scott Johnson had applied for permanent residency, and his professional prospects were good.

“He would have been a first-round draft pick for any university in any part of the world,” his brother said. “He had no reason to be stressed or unhappy.”

The day he disappeared, Scott Johnson told his Ph.D. supervisor, Ross Street of Macquarie University in Sydney, that he’d had a breakthrough on a vexing problem that was crucial to his dissertation.

“It sounded like he had the whole thing in his head,” Professor Street said at the December inquest. “He was happy about it. I was happy about it.”

Today, evidence of what happened to Mr. Johnson, as in many of these cases, is scant. He was found below a gay hangout, but the local police officer who responded to the call testified that he had not known that at the time.



The police found no signs of a struggle at the cliff top, but there had been a storm that could have washed such evidence away. The site was never secured as a crime scene.

In the years after Mr. Johnson’s death, his brother became wealthy in the 1990s tech boom, selling a company that developed compression technology for delivering sound and video over the internet to America Online.

After reading about the 2005 inquest on the Sydney cliff deaths, Steve Johnson began devoting some of his resources to finding out what had happened to his brother. He hired an investigative journalist, Daniel Glick, to go to Australia to dig up court records and other documents. And he assembled an array of high-powered lawyers — his legal team includes a former Massachusetts attorney general, Martha Coakley, who said her firm took the case pro bono — to argue for reopening the case.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In 2012, a new inquest overturned the original finding of suicide. But the coroner reached no conclusion about how Mr. Johnson had died, saying that while anti-gay violence was a possibility, so was an accidental fall.

When the current inquest resumes in June, it will hear new evidence, the coroner’s office has said.

Whatever the result, Steve Johnson and others hope it will spur further investigations of these cases.

“There was clearly a pattern to these deaths,” said Margaret Sheil, whose brother Peter was found dead at the base of a cliff in 1983. “Today, it is extraordinary to think that we would not have had an open discussion about what happened.

A Massachusetts man was charged with hate crimes after he threatened an airline worker at Kennedy International Airport who was wearing a head scarf, kicked her and told her “Trump is here now” and “he will get rid of all of you,” officials said on Thursday.

The man, Robin A. Rhodes, 57, of Worcester, Mass., arrived from Aruba on Wednesday night and was awaiting a connecting flight to Massachusetts when he approached the worker, Rabeeya Khan, in the Delta Air Lines Sky Club lounge at Terminal 2 between 7:10 p.m. and 9:45 p.m., the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said in a statement on Thursday. Ms. Khan wore a head scarf known as a hijab.

Mr. Rhodes went to her office door and asked if she was sleeping and, according to the statement, said: “Are you praying? What are you doing?” He then punched the door, which hit the back of her chair. He threatened Ms. Khan and kicked her in the right leg, according to the statement. She moved to a corner of the office but he kicked the door, stepped into the office and blocked her from leaving.

When another person tried to calm him, he moved away from the door and Ms. Khan ran to the front desk of the lounge, according to the statement. Mr. Rhodes followed her, got on his knees and began to bow down in imitation of a Muslim praying and shouted expletives about Islam and ISIS, the prosecutor’s office said.

In an apparent reference to Muslims, he said, according to the prosecutor’s office: “You can ask Germany, Belgium and France about these kind of people. You will see what happens.”

This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of Donald Trump.

Reliable data on hate crimes is hard to come by. As reports of racist, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic harassment and attacks poured in after the election of Donald Trump, many Americans wondered whether they represented a nationwide increase in hate crime. While the Southern Poverty Law Center saw a dramatic increase in reports after the election, it’s not yet clear whether this indicates a nationwide trend.

That’s one reason This Week in Hate is joining with ProPublica and a coalition of other organizations to work on Documenting Hate, a project that aims to gather data on hate crimes and incidents of bias around the country. Documenting Hate will analyze information from law enforcement, news reports, nonprofit groups and individuals in order to investigate topics like how many hate crimes occur annually, which parts of the country have the highest prevalence and whether the frequency or severity of hate crimes has changed since the election of Mr. Trump. This Week in Hate and several news organizations will publish results from those investigations.

Here are some reports of hate crimes and harassment that have drawn public attention in recent days.

MADRID — A Spanish judge has dismissed a case against two puppeteers almost a year after they were detained for staging a show that was deemed to glorify terrorism and promote hatred.

The arrest of the puppeteers, Raúl García Pérez and Alfonso Lázaro de la Fuente, in February 2016 set off a political controversy and was seen a bellwether for whether Europe’s fight against terrorism was also threatening basic rights of protest and free speech.

The ruling by Judge José María Escribano Lacleriga in Madrid was dated Jan. 5 but not made public until Wednesday. He decided that the evidence was insufficient, dismissing the final charges.

The puppeteers were detained after staging a show that was part of Madrid’s Carnival festivities. Their act featured a puppet police officer who held up a sign falsely accusing a witch, using a play on words that combined Al Qaeda and ETA, the Basque group that has killed more than 800 people in its campaign to secure Basque independence. The show was halted after parents complained and called the police, who arrested the puppeteers.",nytimes.com,True

People with disabilities are more than twice as likely to be the victims of violent crimes as those without disabilities, according to a Justice Department report based on Census Bureau surveys. And people with mental disabilities are the most likely to be victimized.

But some advocates claim the disparity is actually much greater, saying crimes against those with disabilities are less likely to be pursued by law enforcement. They believe people with disabilities may be unable to take part in a survey or go to the police, or may have trouble being understood. As a result, their complaints often are not taken seriously.

“There are probably thousands of other cases just like this one in Chicago, and in some cases worse, that will never see the impact of the justice system because folks don’t know about it,” said Rebecca Cokley, the executive director of the National Council on Disability, a federal agency. “In a lot of cases with people with disabilities, the perpetrators are family members or caretakers, so what happens when the person who would have to take you to the police station is your abuser?”

Advocates have said the underlying problem is a pervasive attitude, conscious or not, that people with disabilities are not fully human. They pointed to a recent case in Idaho, where a white high school football player was charged with shoving a coat hanger into the rectum of another teenager, who was black and had mental disabilities, after having harassed the student and directed racial slurs at him for months.

Though the accused student was 18 at the time of the assault, he was sentenced to probation rather than prison.

“We have, unfortunately, devalued disabled people forever, which means we devalue their suffering,” said Curt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, a nonprofit advocacy group. “What we experience all the time is that police, prosecutors, judges say, ‘Oh, this case is hard, it’s not worth our trouble. This person is hard to understand, or they’re not credible, or they won’t stand up to cross-examination.’”

Mr. Decker said that when Congress spent years drafting, debating, and finally voting on hate crimes legislation, which passed in 2009, it was a struggle to ensure that it punished crimes singling out people with disabilities, as well as bias based on categories like race or sex. Forty-six of the 50 states have hate crimes laws, according to the Anti-Defamation League, but 17 of them do not specify people with disabilities as a protected group.

Vilissa Thompson, an organizer of the Harriet Tubman Collective, a coalition of advocates for disabled black people, said, “People are ignorant about the extent of violence against disabled people, but what’s worse is that there’s this kind of misplaced sympathy for the perpetrator, especially when it’s a parent or caregiver.”",nytimes.com,True

Because there wasn’t much institutional support and Jimmy didn’t fit easily into the wider world, my parents created an inner one that brought the outside in. We were the only family on our block in Camp Hill, Pa., to churn our own ice cream and grow our own watermelons, so the neighborhood children loved coming over. My parents didn’t trust babysitters, so parish dinners, poker games and Knights of Columbus meetings came to us. Bread was always setting, pie crust rolled out, jigsaw puzzles on the card table.

I didn’t love it, and could have done with less “Little House on the Prairie” and more alone time. But it was better than my navigating Jimmy’s world on my own. What can’t be programmed or legislated away — and requires constant “if you see something, say something” — is the hate in hate crime, the base instinct of some to pick on the weak, often because they’re weak themselves. There will always be those grasping the chance to feel superior — witness all the abuse of old people in nursing homes and gay shaming.

I saw cruelty firsthand — and was guilty myself — as a child. Despite my protection, Jimmy was the last to be picked for a team, although he could swing a bat as badly as just about any other 6-year-old. The pack would say they were running one way and go another. Hitting another kid was punishable, but sidling up to Jimmy and subtly pinching him was not. We’d wonder where he got the bruises. But he knew enough to fear the brat pack more than my parents, so he never tattled. One kid loved bending the training wheels on his bike. I sometimes fell in with the crowd. I’d hear the whispers about pretending to go home so that Jimmy would. Later, I’d sneak back out hiding my Wiffle ball from my mother.

That’s not luring a vulnerable man to an empty apartment to be tortured, but it shows how much vigilance is needed. Tim Shriver, who runs the Special Olympics, said that there had been many advances but that “taunting and bullying remain an epidemic for children with intellectual disabilities” and that violence against them “is usually based on misunderstanding and ignorance and is all too often hidden.”

The older the child, the more hidden and difficult to prevent. The 18-year-old victim in Chicago thought one of his tormentors was his friend, and his parents dropped him off to meet him at McDonald’s. They reported him missing when he didn’t come home, but not soon enough to keep him from being tortured for five hours.

I became my brother’s guardian in 1991. He took some time before he learned to cling to me the way he had to our parents. I couldn’t be home with him all the time, so he came many places with me. My friends became his friends. But he was hurt when I least expected it. He didn’t know elevator etiquette and made eye contact with people getting on. As he was stepping off one time, a lawyer who worked in my building turned and called him a “weirdo.” I tracked him down, as I did the kid who stole my brother’s spanking-new Mickey Mantle baseball glove many years ago, and confronted him. He pleaded ignorance. The description fit.

He too is a veteran of the immediate aftermath of the shootings, having covered the funerals of victims and the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina Capitol, which was prompted by the deaths. Given the intense interest in the case, and the demands of filing several updated reports daily while posting regularly on social media, it has been helpful to have two Times correspondents on the story.

Recognizing that the trial would attract a large media contingent, and that half of the seating in the fourth-floor courtroom would be reserved for families of the many victims, Judge Richard M. Gergel of the Federal District Court and court administrators set aside an adjacent courtroom as a media center. The room is filled with video screens that broadcast a closed-circuit feed from multiple camera angles, and credentialed reporters can bring in laptops and cellphones.

Digital devices are not allowed in the actual courtroom, where reporters use old-fashioned pads and pens. Reporters can, however, file electronically from the media center in real time, which enables news organizations, including The Times, to post moment-by-moment coverage of testimony on Twitter.

Live coverage has been one of Alan’s priorities. I spend most of my time in the courtroom, absorbing atmosphere and reactions that are not always apparent on video. In an innovative move, the court has been posting online almost all of the hundreds of exhibits introduced in the trial — the exception being gruesome crime scene photographs — usually by early evening. We have selected the most interesting ones to run on our website, including Mr. Roof’s writings and the video of his confession to the F.B.I. That has given readers a chance to see key pieces of evidence unfiltered.

Nearly every day of testimony has been emotional — and draining. Although Mr. Roof’s guilt was never in question — his court-appointed lawyers acknowledged it from the start — the prosecution’s thoughtfully constructed case has been impressive.

Most compelling to me was the second day, which began with snippets of footage from the church’s surveillance camera. The recordings, which showed Mr. Roof arriving at the church, and leaving less than an hour later, Glock pistol in hand, led to his rapid identification and arrest.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The images also showed victims as they arrived at church earlier in the day. There was 87-year-old Susie Jackson, gripping her cane and purse as she made her way into the whitewashed church. There was Mr. Pinckney, leading his 6-year-old daughter by the hand and greeting church ladies with hugs and pats on the back. We watched as they lived the final hours of their lives. After the lunch break, the prosecution showed crime scene photographs of the same nine people, splayed out on the linoleum floor of the fellowship hall, blood pooling where they had dropped.

Mr. Roof’s courtroom strategy has been enigmatic from the start. He sidelined his lawyers and opted to represent himself during jury selection, brought them back for the guilt phase of the trial and then jettisoned them again for the sentencing proceedings. He has sat impassively day after day, as emotionless when the court clerk announced the guilty verdicts as he was when one of the survivors, Felicia Sanders, testified that he belonged in “the pit of hell.”

There was great uncertainty as to how Mr. Roof would use his opening statement to the jury during the penalty phase. His life was on the line, and he had announced that he would not present witnesses or evidence on his behalf. He made it clear he had chosen to represent himself in order to thwart his lawyers’ efforts to portray him as mentally disturbed, even though that mitigating factor afforded him the most likely lifesaving defense.

Over barbecue the night before Mr. Roof’s statement, Alan and I had speculated about whether he would express remorse and plead for mercy, or maybe unleash a racist rant. It did not occur to either of us that Mr. Roof would do what he did on Wednesday morning: walk to the lectern, insist to the jury that “there’s nothing wrong with me psychologically,” then return to his seat faster than the ink could dry on my legal pad.

The reporters in the courtroom were stunned. Mr. Roof, who had previously offered to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, was now refusing to take the steps needed to avoid execution.

From the start, a palpable sense of loss has weighed heavily on the proceedings against Mr. Roof. The courtroom here is packed with people who have lost their dearest loved ones. It’s not comparable, of course, but outside of the building, I detect another form of loss.

As I have covered the intersections of race, politics and faith over the years, I have always found black churches to be the most welcoming of places. Like Dylann Roof on the night of the massacre, I have been invited in through open doors, embraced by strangers, even prayed for. But, now, when I arrive unannounced in black churches in Charleston, a white man carrying a black work bag large enough to conceal a semiautomatic weapon, I can feel uneasy stares. Sometimes when I knock, the locked doors are opened just a crack. At services at Mother Emanuel several weeks ago, an usher asked if I was a reporter and, after I told him I was, demanded to search my bag anyway.

http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/us/chicago-racially-charged-attack-video.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Police officials said the victim knew one of the suspects, several of whom seemed intoxicated.

While it was one instance of violence in a city where young people are killed almost every day, the attack, particularly on social media and conservative news outlets, turned into a test of how the country views race.

It also seemed to tap into the very issues that have grown the rawest around the nation of late: a divisive political climate, a painful racial split and an increasingly fierce and polarized social media universe.

“If this had been done to an African-American by four whites, every liberal in the country would be outraged, and there would be no question it is a hate crime,” Newt Gingrich, a Republican and former speaker of the House, said on “Fox and Friends.”

A hashtag linking the assault to the Black Lives Matter movement exploded on social media, prompting a leader of the movement, DeRay Mckesson, to respond on Twitter, “It goes without saying that the actions being branded by the far-right as the ‘BLM Kidnapping’ have nothing to do w/ the movement.”

Pat Brady, a former chairman of the Illinois Republican Party and a former prosecutor, said the attack should not be viewed as having some larger meaning.

“To be fair, we can acknowledge that we’ve had some really bad political discourse in this election, but this is about four sick kids who probably can’t even spell Trump let alone know anything about the election,” Mr. Brady said.

The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said he had been urgently trying to reach the victim’s family. “We want to do whatever we can do to help, to show our love for the child,” he said.

Of the attack itself, he said, “This is an ethical collapse, not an ethnic affirmation.”

In Washington, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said the beating demonstrated “a level of depravity that is an outrage to a lot of Americans.”

Police officials said they had sought the hate crime charges because of comments about the victim’s race and diminished mental capacity. Commander Duffin said the police did not know whether the victim had voted in November, or whether that had influenced the attack. But the invocation of Mr. Trump’s name, and the simmering racial tensions after a contentious election season, convinced many on social media that it was an act of racial hatred with political overtones.

In Chicago, city officials and black leaders condemned the attack and offered support to the victim.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the assault “sickening,” adding, “There is more to our city than that.”

The victim, who has not been identified by the Chicago police, had been reported missing days earlier by his parents. The police said he had met up with Jordan Hill, whom he considered a friend, at a suburban McDonald’s on New Year’s Eve. Mr. Hill, 18, from nearby Carpentersville, Ill., stole a vehicle, the police said, drove to the West Side with the victim and had been visiting friends for a couple of days before the beating.

But what started as a playful fight on Tuesday between the victim and Mr. Hill, the police said, escalated into an hourslong beating.

Mr. Hill was charged along with three Chicago residents: Tesfaye Cooper, 18; Brittany Covington, 18; and Tanishia Covington, 24. All four were accused of aggravated kidnapping, hate crimes, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon; they were scheduled to appear in bond court here on Friday.

Mr. Hill was also charged with robbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and residential burglary. Mr. Cooper and Brittany Covington were also charged with residential burglary.

A roughly 30-minute video clip shared widely online appeared to show a Facebook livestream of the assault. A group can be seen taunting and physically assaulting a man amid cursing and laughing. Much of the video focuses on one woman as she rambles, at times incoherently. The women, police officials said, were both smoking what they described as marijuana.

The video begins with a shot of one woman before turning to the victim, who is seated in the corner of a room with his mouth covered. The woman laughs as two men cut the sleeve of the victim’s shirt. One of the men yells epithets about Mr. Trump and “white people.” Later, a man is seen cutting a patch of hair from the victim’s head, appearing to draw blood in the process.

Officers found the victim wandering bloodied and in distress with Mr. Hill on Tuesday in a dangerous part of the West Side. The police were eventually able to link the victim to a nearby report of a battery. The victim was treated at a hospital and had been released by Wednesday night.

The beating in the video comes at a time of increased violence in Chicago. The city had 762 homicides in 2016, the most since the 1990s, a grim milestone that drew the attention of Mr. Trump this week.

At the Rev. Marshall Hatch’s church, not far from where the victim was found, ministers met after getting calls from concerned residents, many of whom said they wanted to help raise money for the victim.

“People don’t want this to be the face of our neighborhood,” Mr. Hatch said. “And more than that, they have a very genuine concern about the victim.”

Of suggestions that a black victim in such an attack might draw more outrage and concern, Mr. Hatch said that he had not sensed a racial dimension to the response in his mostly black neighborhood.

“Nobody is making excuses for the behavior of these young people,” he said. “People really just feel for this victim.”",nytimes.com,True

This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of Donald Trump. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups are keeping detailed counts of harassment and abuse, amid concerns about a rise in hate crimes after the election. Here are some recent incidents, which we are publishing on a weekly basis to draw attention to the issue.

• A woman has been arrested on hate crime charges after allegedly slashing the face of a black transgender man on a Manhattan subway on Dec. 25. She also allegedly told the man she did not want to sit next to a black person.

• On Dec. 30, a man in Highlands, Tex., discovered that his car had been burned and his home vandalized with racial slurs. Authorities are investigating the incident as a possible bias crime.

• Two menorahs in Brooklyn playgrounds were vandalized last week.

• Residents of Esperance, N.Y., discovered swastikas painted on homes and other buildings on New Year’s Day. State police are investigating the vandalism.",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Johnson said criminal charges against the suspects, two men and two women, could be announced on Thursday. Investigators said they were not yet sure of a motive, but could pursue hate crime and kidnapping charges if the evidence warranted. The victim knew one of his attackers, the police said, and had been taken from the suburbs to the city and held for some time before the beating was streamed online.

“Images in the video put on display the brazenness of the offenders who assaulted the victim and then broadcast it for the entire world to see,” Mr. Johnson said.

The victim, whom the police did not name, was hospitalized for undisclosed injuries, but had been released by Wednesday evening and was speaking with investigators. The police said he was “traumatized” and initially had trouble communicating with detectives.

The video’s spread online comes at a time of relentless violence in Chicago. In a Twitter post this week, Mr. Trump cited Chicago’s 762 murders last year and suggested that the city should seek federal help if local efforts to control the violence continued to be ineffective. Superintendent Johnson declined to speculate on whether the president-elect’s Twitter message and the videotaped beating were connected.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/us/dylann-roof-sentencing.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Mr. Roof, who was then 21, continued: “I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country and I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race. I have shed a tear of self-pity for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place. I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed.”

As the government laid out its case for a death sentence, the prosecutor who read from the journal, Nathan S. Williams, an assistant United States attorney, told the jury of 10 women and two men that Mr. Roof’s deadly rampage was a premeditated act that had devastated the families of his victims.

“The defendant didn’t stop after shooting one person or two or four or five; he killed nine people,” Mr. Williams said, a few moments before he declared, “The death penalty is justified.”

Later, aided by a slide show, he described each of the victims and their lives, setting the stage for several days of gut-wrenching testimony by family members and friends of the victims. Mr. Williams emphasized that Mr. Roof was capable of remorse and regret, reminding jurors that he had left his mother a note of apology, but only for the pain he knew his actions would cause his own family.

From the Courthouse @alanblinder is covering the penalty phase of the Dylann Roof trial in Charleston, S.C.

The presentations were a startling beginning to the trial’s sentencing phase, which is expected to run into next week in Federal District Court. On Dec. 15, after six days of testimony in which defense lawyers did not contest his guilt, the jury found Mr. Roof guilty of 33 counts, including hate crimes, obstruction of religion resulting in death, and firearms charges.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Eighteen of those counts require the jury to decide whether to sentence Mr. Roof, now 22, to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. To impose a death sentence, jurors must unanimously find that aggravating factors like premeditation and the number and vulnerability of the victims outweigh any mitigating factors, like the absence of prior violent behavior and demonstrations of redemption and remorse. Mr. Roof is also facing a death penalty trial in state court.

Although many people in the courtroom had already heard Mr. Roof’s flat, Southern-inflected monotone during the guilt phase, when prosecutors played a video recording of his post-arrest confession to F.B.I. agents, his statement on Wednesday was his first to the jury.

Mr. Roof chose to allow his court-appointed legal team to represent him during the guilt phase, but sidelined them during the penalty proceedings to prevent them from introducing any evidence regarding his family background or mental capacity.

“The point is that I’m not going to lie to you, not by myself or through somebody else,” Mr. Roof told the jury. As his paternal grandparents watched from the second row on the left side of the courtroom, several women on the right side, which is reserved for victims’ family members, left their seats, one of them muttering curses.

Mr. Roof has said he does not plan to call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf, and he did not cross-examine any of the prosecution’s witnesses on Wednesday. His approach stands in sharp contrast to the strategy of Justice Department lawyers, who have said they may call more than 30 witnesses, including at least one survivor of the attack, family members of the victims and federal law enforcement officials.

Prosecutors began Wednesday with the widow of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the church’s slain pastor, and his two best friends.

Jennifer Benjamin Pinckney, who was married to Mr. Pinckney for 15 years, narrated an affectionate and often lighthearted telling of their life together, illustrated by dozens of photographs of her husband — as a young saxophone player in a school band, attending the births of their two daughters, vacationing on Caribbean cruises and on a trip to Seattle.

She described him as a soul-stirring preacher who extended his ministry as “a voice for the voiceless” to his work in the South Carolina Legislature, where he served first in the House and then the Senate. Often exhausted by his dual roles, he was depicted in several pictures as having fallen asleep in the back seat of the family car and on a couch while reading to his daughters.

“He was the person that I think every mom would be happy that her daughter would marry,” Ms. Pinckney, a school librarian, said. “He was that great catch.”

Ms. Pinckney also described her terror on the night of June 17, 2015, as she and the couple’s younger daughter, Malana, then 6, listened to the gunfire from their hiding place beneath a desk in her husband’s study. As her husband and the others were gunned down in the adjacent church fellowship hall, Ms. Pinckney struggled to keep her daughter quiet and still.

“I was just like, ‘Shh, shh, shh,’ ” Ms. Pinckney said, “and I put my hand over her mouth, and she was holding on to me, and she put her hand on my mouth.”

“Mama, is Daddy going to die?” her daughter asked, Ms. Pinckney said. She said the hardest thing she had ever done was telling her two daughters early the next morning that their father had been killed.

Ms. Pinckney said she had heard Mr. Roof try to open the door to the study, which she had locked when the shooting began. Another assistant United States attorney, Julius N. Richardson, asked why she thought she had been spared. “It wasn’t my time,” Ms. Pinckney answered. “I couldn’t see God taking both parents away from two small kids.”

The Rev. Kylon Middleton, an A.M.E. minister who had known Mr. Pinckney from childhood, described his lifelong friend as immensely precocious (he began preaching at 13) and strategically ambitious (he aspired to be both a bishop and, perhaps, the state’s first African-American governor).

In addition to Mr. Pinckney, the victims were the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor, 49; Cynthia Hurd, 54; Susie Jackson, 87; Ethel Lee Lance, 70; Tywanza Sanders, 26; the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr., 74; the Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; and Myra Thompson, 59.

Near the end of the day, Ms. Thompson’s widower, the Rev. Anthony B. Thompson, the vicar of a Reformed Episcopal Church here, told jurors about their 16-year marriage, their anniversary date to a beach, his wife’s determined demeanor and her commitment to the historic congregation.

In testimony that was mixed with laughter and tears, Mr. Thompson recounted their final day together as she prepared for the evening study of the Gospel of Mark. “She had her glow,” he said. “I mean, this smile on her face. She was radiant. I just kept looking at her.”

Word of a shooting came hours later, and Mr. Thompson rushed to the church. He demanded to know whether she had been injured or killed. He eventually found out.

Thirteen other reports appeared to be false.

The S.P.L.C. has a list of reports that have been proved to be or are probably false, including the claim by a Muslim student that she was attacked by Trump supporters on a Manhattan subway.

It’s not unusual to see some false claims amid an uptick in hate crimes, said Ms. Beirich. “The hoaxes are terrible,” she said, “but it doesn’t make these other things any less real.”

The number of reports is falling.

Starting with more than 200 the day after the election, the number of reports per day fell to the single digits in early December. The same thing happened in Britain after Brexit, said Ms. Beirich, with a surge in hate crimes followed by a drop. However, she said, if the Trump administration “continues to demonize certain populations, whether it be Latinos or immigrants or the Muslim community,” hate crimes against those groups will continue: “That’s a pattern that has played itself out over and over again.”

Elected officials at the state and city level, as well as members of the community, can help fight hate and harassment by speaking out in support of immigrants and others who are vulnerable, she said. Law enforcement needs to take hate crimes seriously and investigate them aggressively.

Ms. Beirich said that because Mr. Trump’s campaign and election have brought such a jump in hate crimes, she felt he had a duty to denounce them much more vigorously than he has. George W. Bush’s address at a mosque six days after 9/11, in which he said, “Islam is peace,” had a big effect on anti-Muslim harassment. President-elect Trump needs to do more than make a few comments in interviews, she said. “What we need is real leadership on his part to tamp this down.”

Today, Christians are still at the mercy of a regime that has consistently let them down. The Coptic Church itself preaches patience, discouraging protests in the hope that such docility will protect the community from more violence.

It has not. The anger at that realization was clear when protesters outside the bombed church turned away TV anchors known for their pro-regime views.

The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights has documented at least 77 cases of sectarian attacks on Copts between 2011 and 2016 in the province of Minya alone. In that state, south of Cairo, Christians are estimated to make up about one-third of the population. Pope Tawadros, the head of the Coptic Church, has said that attacks against Christians have occurred on average about once a month over the past three years.

In May, hundreds of Muslims set fire to homes of Christians in Minya. The unrest began after rumors that a Christian man had had an affair with a Muslim woman. The man fled with his wife and children, while his parents, fearing for their lives, went to the police. The police did nothing. The next day, around 300 Muslim men looted and burned the parents’ house and stripped the mother naked in the street. They also ransacked and set fire to six other houses, witnesses told Reuters.

In July, again in Minya, Muslims burned Christian homes because of a rumor that a Christian intended to turn a kindergarten into a church. Such attacks are not limited to Minya. In June, a video aired on YouTube showing dozens of people in the streets of a village near Alexandria, chanting, “We don’t want a church.” The mob assaulted Copts and attacked a building they identified as Christian.

The Egyptian Parliament recently ratified such bigotry when it passed a long-awaited law imposing restrictions on the construction and renovation of churches. No such restrictions apply to Muslims and mosques. There are 2,869 churches in Egypt, compared with 108,395 mosques.

No one has stood trial for any of these attacks. In too many instances, the police don’t care to investigate. They round up a few suspects, but then release them without charges. On some occasions, Christians are even pressed into “reconciliation” sessions with the Muslim neighbors who attacked them. In other cases, Christians have had to leave their homes, villages or towns.

In contrast, the Egyptian criminal justice system has been swift and harsh on Christians. In February, a court in Minya sentenced three Coptic teenagers to five years in prison after they appeared in a video apparently mocking Muslim prayers. They claimed the video was mocking the beheading videos of the Islamic State, but they were convicted of insulting Islam. A fourth defendant was sent to a juvenile detention center by the court.

Not one of us, Muslim or Christian, is free in Egypt, but that is no excuse for the authorities’ indifference to the violence and discrimination Christians here face. There has never been a Christian president, and it’s been decades since there was a Christian prime minister. Copts can count no mayors, no public university presidents or deans, and only a handful of government ministers and members of Parliament. Only a small minority of the upper ranks of the security services and armed forces are Christians.

When the subject of discrimination against Christians comes up, it is often dismissed with the facile “some of my best friends are Christian” argument. Too many Egyptians refuse to acknowledge the way such denial endangers Christian lives.

One glimmer of hope came recently from the president of Cairo University, Gaber Nasser. In October, he ruled that university documents should no longer specify the religion of any student or staff member. This move came after a graduate student complained that he was denied enrollment because he was Christian.

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/nyregion/manhattan-yasmin-seweid-false-hate-crime.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"An 18-year-old Muslim woman who claimed that three men attacked her on a Manhattan subway this month and tried to pull off her hijab was charged on Wednesday with filing a false report, the police said.

The woman, Yasmin Seweid, a student at Baruch College, was also charged with obstructing governmental administration, the police said. Both charges are misdemeanors.

Ms. Seweid, of New Hyde Park on Long Island, had told the police that three white men screaming “Donald Trump!” attacked her on Dec. 1 on an uptown No. 6 train at East 23rd Street, DNAinfo.com reported.

She told the police that the men had called her a terrorist and that when she tried to move to the other end of the subway car, one of them followed and tried to pull off her traditional head scarf.

DNAinfo reported that she recanted the story on Tuesday and had made it up to get attention because of problems she was having with her family.

It was not immediately clear if she had a lawyer.

A spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Ibrahim Hooper, said in an interview on Wednesday that Muslims in America were feeling “tremendous psychological stress and pressure” that can result in episodes like this one.

“No one out of the blue decides to make this kind of report,” he said. “Whenever there are these rare instances of alleged false reports — it’s still an allegation at this point — it’s used by the growing Islamophobic community to delegitimize and undermine the many legitimate anti-Muslim incidents.”",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/nyregion/queens-hate-crime-bernhard-laufer.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Mr. Laufer’s lawyer, Alexander E. Eisemann, said his client planned to appeal the conviction and the sentence, which he called “clearly excessive.” Mr. Laufer has an extensive history of mental illness, and Mr. Eisemann said he had been restricted in his “ability to develop a full psychiatric defense.”

On Nov. 16, 2012, prosecutors said, Mr. Laufer vandalized the mosque, Masjid Al-Saaliheen, in the Kew Gardens Hills neighborhood. That day and the next day, Mr. Laufer repeatedly left threatening voice messages.

And on Nov. 18, prosecutors said, Mr. Laufer came up from behind as a 57-year-old man, identified by the authorities as Bashir Ahmad, unlocked the door for morning prayers. Mr. Laufer stabbed Mr. Ahmad in the head, arm, back and hand, and bit him, prosecutors said.

Investigators were able to connect Mr. Laufer to the attack by of a pair of eyeglasses that had been left at the scene, which had DNA evidence on them that was a match with Mr. Laufer. The calls made to the mosque had also been placed from his home telephone numbers, prosecutors said.

A woman who answered the telephone at the mosque on Wednesday declined to comment on the case, except to say, “What’s done cannot be undone.”

Last year, Mr. Laufer pleaded guilty in federal court in Brooklyn to sending death threats by email to Nihad Awad, the executive director and founder of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. In the messages, sent in 2014, Mr. Laufer signed his name, describing himself as a “mad man,” and called Mr. Awad a “Jihadi Bastard.” He threatened to mutilate him, taking out his eyes, “before I kill you.”

He was sentenced in that case to 13 months in federal prison, the time he had served in the span between his arrest and the sentencing. Mr. Laufer, who lives in Rego Park, was also sentenced to six months of home arrest and three years of supervised release, and he was required to undergo treatment for mental health issues.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/us/dylann-roof-trial-charleston.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Before the defense rested, Judge Gergel, of Federal District Court, summoned Mr. Roof to the bench, placed him under oath out of the jury’s presence and asked if he wanted to testify in his own defense. Mr. Roof, 22, with pale white skin and a distinctive bowl-shaped haircut, said he did not.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Judge Gergel has scheduled closing arguments for Thursday, and jurors are then expected to begin deliberations.

If Mr. Roof is convicted — a virtual certainty, as he confessed in a recorded F.B.I. interview and left a trail of incontrovertible evidence — the jury will return in January to hear more evidence and decide whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison. Mr. Roof, who offered to plead guilty in exchange for a life term, plans to represent himself during that phase. He also faces capital murder charges in state court in a trial scheduled to begin on Jan. 17.

Over six days, federal prosecutors presented the jury with an array of technical evidence that established the timeline of Mr. Roof’s plot, but they bookended their case with Ms. Sheppard’s testimony and that of her friend and fellow survivor, Felicia Sanders, who appeared as the opening witness.

Guided gently through questioning by an assistant United States attorney, Julius N. Richardson, Ms. Sheppard humanized the nine victims. There was the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr., known as “Dapper Dan,” who always wore a fedora and usually led the Bible study. She spoke of Ethel Lee Lance, who cleaned the church with “a woman’s touch” and loved the song “One Day at a Time.” Tywanza Sanders had a “big smile,” and his great-aunt, Susie Jackson, was “a very sweet lady.” The Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor “could sing like an angel.” Cynthia Hurd, a librarian, had a soft spot for Zora Neale Hurston. And the Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, the tall, graceful track coach, could preach like nobody’s business.

Ms. Sheppard said she attended the Bible study that night only because her get-things-done friend, Myra Thompson, was leading it. She sat near the back because she planned to sneak out early, but Ms. Thompson kept an eye on her.

At some point, Ms. Sheppard testified, nodding toward Mr. Roof, “the young man at the table over there joined us.” She said the church’s pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, asked Mr. Roof if he was there for the study session, handed him a Bible and a pamphlet about the night’s lesson, and offered him a chair.

Usually, Ms. Sheppard said, the group would end with a prayer adapted from Genesis: “The Lord watch between me and thee when we are absent from another.” But as they rose for the benediction, the gunman began firing, she said. Mr. Pinckney was the first to be shot.

Ms. Sheppard said she first thought the explosions had come from the church’s aging wiring but then heard Ms. Sanders scream, “He’s shooting!” She reached for Ms. Lance’s cellphone and, after initially pressing the wrong buttons, managed to dial 911.

“He shot the pastor,” she told the dispatcher during a recorded call that was played in court on Wednesday. “He shot all the men in the church.”

Soon after, she told the dispatcher, “There’s so many people dead, I think. Oh, my God.”

When the gunman finally left the building, Ms. Sheppard checked the pulse of Mr. Pinckney and another victim. She found none.

Mr. Roof, who confessed that he had planned to kill himself if confronted by the police at the church, fled in his car into the sweltering South Carolina night. He was captured the next day in North Carolina.

The evidence that prosecutors presented against him included GPS data showing he had visited the church’s neighborhood six times in the six months before the attack and telephone records showing he had called the church four months before. They also have used Mr. Roof’s writings, photographs and possessions to depict him as a racial extremist.

Jurors heard, for instance, that he had downloaded a history of the Ku Klux Klan in August 2014, and that investigators found in his bedroom a pillowcase cut into a triangular shape, perhaps to represent a Klan hood. Prosecutors presented photographs Mr. Roof had taken of the Confederate battle flag when it flew on the grounds of the State House, before its removal in July 2015 in response to the shootings. They had a witness read aloud a white supremacist manifesto that Mr. Roof had posted online.

They also showed chilling footage of Mr. Roof’s preparations for his assault on the church, including surveillance video of his purchase of a Glock .45 caliber handgun and hollow-point ammunition. Mr. Roof also recorded himself, wearing a black muscle shirt and reflective sunglasses, practicing with his laser-sight-equipped pistol, expressionlessly firing shot after shot.

But on the final day of testimony, prosecutors turned away from Mr. Roof’s planning and back to its consequences.

A forensic pathologist, Dr. S. Erin Presnell, described the findings of autopsies that showed the nine parishioners had been struck at least 60 times.

Then Ms. Sheppard, a bright pink scarf draped around her neck, mounted the witness stand. She plucked a tissue or two from a nearby box, and told her story for about 40 minutes.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/us/dylann-roof-shooting-charleston-south-carolina-church-video.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Mr. Roof answered the agents’ questions eagerly in a matter-of-fact tone, his voice deeper than might be expected from his boyish appearance. He did not so much express remorse as depict his actions as necessary to retaliate for what he perceived as an epidemic of black-on-white crime.

“I regret doing it a little bit,” he said, before the agents revealed to him the body count, which Mr. Roof had guessed was perhaps four or five. Once they did, and prompted him for his reaction, he said, “It makes me feel bad,” but there was little emotion in his voice. “I wouldn’t say I’m glad I did it,” he said. “I’ve done it, so” — he paused — “I had to do it.”

When one of the agents asked if he hoped to be a martyr, he answered, “Well, that would be nice, sure, but I didn’t know if that’s what would happen.”

Mr. Roof is charged with 33 federal counts, including hate crimes resulting in death, and he is being tried only because the Justice Department rejected his offer to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. He also faces separate capital murder charges in a state trial scheduled for mid-January.

The racial rationale Mr. Roof provided to two F.B.I. agents, Michael E. Stansbury and Craig Januchowski, closely resembled the online manifesto he is alleged to have written shortly before the killings and a journal found afterward in his car. “Well I had to do it because somebody had to do something because, you know, black people are killing white people every day on the streets, and they rape white women, 100 white women a day,” he told the agents. “The fact of the matter is what I did is so minuscule to what they’re doing to white people every day, all the time.”

Mr. Roof, who noted the declining influence of hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan, said, “Nobody else is brave enough to do anything about it.”

In the courtroom, Mr. Roof, dressed in a gray cable-knit sweater, sometimes leafed through papers at the defense table as the grainy video recording played on several screens.

Mr. Roof, who is from Eastover, near Columbia, said in the interview that he had selected Emanuel, which was founded in 1818, because he knew it was historic and that he would find a concentration of African-Americans worshiping there. He said he did not know anything specific about its history and denied that his choice had any connection to the racial outcry surrounding the shooting of a black motorist by a white police officer in North Charleston two months earlier.

He also made it clear that the Wednesday night Bible study session provided an easy target. “Well it’s like this, you see, I’m not in the position, you know, by myself, you know, to go into like a black neighborhood, you know, or something like that and shoot up, you know, drug dealers or something like that,” he said. “You know what I’m saying? That’s not going to do anything. You see what I’m saying. I had to go somewhere else.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Roof said he hoped his attack would agitate race relations and awaken white Americans to the notion that they are “second-class citizens.” He said his “racial awareness” had been inspired by a Google search of the phrase “black on white crime” after the reaction to the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black 17-year-old, by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. ”That was it,” he said.

He said that while sitting silently through the Bible study, his weapon and ammunition concealed in a fanny pack, he considered not going through with his plan. “I could have walked out,” he said, “and you know, that’s just what I was thinking, but then I just like, I don’t know, I don’t want to say spur of the moment, but, you know, I just finally decided I had to do it.”

He had no co-conspirators, Mr. Roof said, and he was under the influence of nothing stronger than a few swigs of vodka. Neither he nor his family had ever been victimized by African-Americans, he said. He told the agents he was trying not to think about either the dead churchgoers or how his parents might react.

When the agents pushed him to declare his guilt, he chuckled. “I am guilty,” he blurted. “We all know I’m guilty.”

The jury of 18, including six alternates, heard Mr. Roof’s confession a day after prosecutors put before them a stark juxtaposition of images: first a series of videos captured by the church’s security cameras of the victims entering the church in their last hours alive, ending with Mr. Roof’s arrival, then a grisly series of crime scene photographs of the devastation inside the fellowship hall.

This new trend of inclusion occurs amid a more sinister one, as reported hate crimes against Muslims are on the rise in the United States and Canada.

The F.B.I. says that a surge in hate crimes against Muslims has led to an overall increase in hate crimes in the United States; Muslims have borne the brunt of the increase with 257 recorded attacks. A spike in bias attacks has been reported since the election of Donald J. Trump, with episodes ranging from an attack against a Muslim police officer in New York City to vandalism of a mosque in Massachusetts. (The crimes, which include anti-Semitic and racist attacks, are so frequent The Times is tracking them weekly.)

In Canada, where Ms. Massa has lived since she was a year old, the number of reported hate crimes has dropped slightly overall, but the number of recorded attacks against Muslims has grown: 99 attacks were reported in 2014, according to an analysis by the news site Global News of data from Statistics Canada, a government agency. That number doubled from the 45 reported in 2012.

On Twitter, Ms. Massa has been flooded with compliments for her work on CityNews, but with the good comes an influx of hateful messaging.

“The more exposure I get,” Ms. Massa said, “the more hate I get. Which I guess comes with the territory.”

She added: “You take the good with the bad.”

Her colleagues, who have also received hate mail, have spoken out publicly in Ms. Massa’s defense. When it comes to her detractors, Ms. Massa has adopted the following credo: “That negative reaction comes from reading a headline and seeing a photo and deciding they don’t like the way I look. That’s not my problem. That’s theirs.”

In that vein, high-profile instances of inclusion will continue. Companies are responding to a demand that is clear in commerce and expansive on social media: The Muslim cosmetics and care market is projected to reach $80 billion by 2020.

Last year, H&M hired a hijabi model who was discovered on Instagram. Elsewhere on the platform, an account featuring a hijab-wearing Barbie, Hijarbie, has more than 76,000 followers. A Muslim teenager has created a plan to bring hijabi emojis to phone keyboards everywhere. And Ms. Afia was discovered after amassing a following on YouTube.

Not everyone wants to see a woman in a head scarf represented in popular culture, and that even includes some Muslim women, who believe that a hijab represents only one side of a large and diverse religion.

Even the word “hijab” belies how complex the uses of the scarf can be: It’s a catchall term for scarves that differ by type and trend. Not all Muslim women wear head coverings. Some believe the hijab is not a religious requirement, while others view it as a symbol of oppression.

The reasons a woman chooses to wear a hijab can be highly personal, with some seeing modesty as its own form of empowerment.

Celene Ibrahim, a Muslim chaplain at Tufts University, said that these examples of Muslim women wearing the hijab were encouraging but that they also highlighted obstacles to come. In particular, the visible symbol suggests a uniformity in the Muslim community that is not accurate.

The community looks very different “depending on who you ask,” Ms. Ibrahim said in an interview. “And I think that diversity is something that people are really struggling to get their minds around.”

Ms. Sanders’s heart-rending account opened testimony in United States District Court after Mr. Roof’s lawyer began to argue for a sentence of life in prison for the 22-year-old avowed white supremacist. Faced with perhaps his only chance to persuade the jury to spare Mr. Roof’s life, the lawyer, David I. Bruck, used his opening statement to concede Mr. Roof’s guilt and suggest doubts about his stability.

“In fairness and in mercy, our society does not invoke the death penalty if there are reasons to choose life, a life in prison,” said Mr. Bruck, the leader of the court-appointed defense team that Mr. Roof plans to jettison during a second phase of the trial, when jurors will decide whether he should be executed. “We do not behave like the person who committed this crime.”

Earlier, the lead prosecutor, Julius N. Richardson, an assistant United States attorney, introduced each of the nine victims, showing the jurors their photographs, describing their lives and explaining how they came to gather in the church’s fellowship hall that night.

“We will prove to you that the defendant’s attack was cold and calculating,” Mr. Richardson said. “It was done with malice in his heart, in his mind, racist retribution for perceived offenses against the white race.”

Mr. Richardson told the jury that the prosecution would prove that Mr. Roof was well aware of the historic church’s significance to the African-American community and that he intended the attack as a racial call to arms. Founded in 1818, the downtown church, known here as Mother Emanuel, is one of the oldest independent black congregations in the South and played central roles in the plotting of a failed slave revolt in 1822 and in civil rights activities 140 years later.

Ms. Sanders testified that her wounded son managed to tell Mr. Roof that he did not need to continue shooting, that they meant him no harm. “I have to do this,” she quoted the gunman as responding, “because y’all are raping our women and y’all are taking over our world.” That, she said, was “when he put about five bullets in my son. I couldn’t move. I was just waiting on my turn.”

Mr. Roof is charged with 33 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death, and also faces a death penalty trial in state court that is scheduled for mid-January. Federal prosecutors rejected his offer to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life without parole.

Mr. Bruck made no effort to dispute the thrust of the prosecution’s case. “The story Mr. Richardson just finished telling you really did occur,” he said. “Dylann Roof really is the person.”

The jury of 18, including six alternates, that was selected Wednesday morning consists of 12 whites, five blacks and one who identifies as “other.” Thirteen are women and five are men.

Mr. Roof and his defense team have been at uneasy odds for a month over the lawyers’ desire to try to save his life by presenting evidence of mental instability. After a week of legal wrangling, Judge Richard M. Gergel agreed to Mr. Roof’s request that Mr. Bruck and his team represent him during the guilt phase but that he represent himself during the penalty phase.

Knowing he would be sidelined when allowed to present evidence of Mr. Roof’s family background and psychological history, Mr. Bruck, one of the country’s foremost capital defenders, used his opening statement to plant notions that the rampage was the work of a disturbed man.

“On what planet does someone have to be to think you could advance a political agenda by attacking these nine people who are the most kind, upstanding — I will use the world noble — people you could possibly find in this community or any other,” Mr. Bruck told the jury. “Does it make any sense at all and, if not, what does that tell you?”

He also tried to focus the jury on Mr. Roof’s youth. In his only question to Ms. Sanders, he asked if Mr. Roof had said at some point that he was 21 years old. He had, she said.

In a recent interview, Richard Allen, Facebook’s head of public policy in Europe, said that the social network was committed to tackling hate speech online, but that there was a fine line between what was legitimate under freedom of speech laws and what was required to protect people online.

In Germany, where Facebook, in particular, has come under scrutiny, a government-backed task force is to report early next year on whether the social network, among other companies, has met national targets for responding to — and potentially eliminating — hate speech. Officials want companies to remove at least 70 percent of online hate speech within 24 hours of it being reported.

And the embrace of Muslims is hardly universal. A few Jewish groups have applauded Mr. Trump’s hard line on Muslims, and cheered his choice of Lt. Gen. Michael T.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The white man charged in the shooting deaths of nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church asked a judge on Sunday if he could have his defense team back, at least temporarily.

In a handwritten request, the defendant, Dylann S. Roof, asked Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court to return his defense team for the guilt phase of his federal death penalty trial, which is scheduled to begin in Charleston within days.

“I would like to ask if my lawyers can represent me for the guilt phase of the trial only,” Mr. Roof wrote. “Can you let me have them back for the guilt phase, and then let me represent myself for the sentencing phase of the trial? If you would allow that, then that is what I would like to do.”

Mr. Roof, 22, faces dozens of federal charges, including hate crimes and obstruction of the practice of religion, for the June 2015 killings at the end of a Bible study session at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. The police said he hurled racial slurs during the shooting and left three people alive so they could tell the world that the reason for the killings was that he hated black people.

The request comes a week after Judge Gergel allowed Mr. Roof to represent himself, as court convened to begin the process of jury selection. Judge Gergel, who last month found Mr. Roof competent to stand trial, said Mr. Roof had the constitutional right to act as his own lawyer.

Mr. Roof’s former defense team has remained his legal advisers but has sought to play a larger role in his defense, expressing concern last week that Mr. Roof may not present evidence that could sway a jury to spare his life — an omission that could violate the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.",nytimes.com,True

White nationalists have been captured on video raising their hands in a Nazi salute while shouting “Hail Trump.” Hate crimes have surged across the country — the Southern Poverty Law Center gathered reports of 867 in just the 10 days after the election. Yet, unlike his predecessors, our president-elect has been mostly silent in condemning the hate talk and violence being done in his name.

In an interview with this paper, Donald J. Trump said that the alt-right is “not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why,” seemingly unable to fathom that the reason they are “energized” is because of him and the thing he needs to “look into” are his own words.

When asked by “60 Minutes” whether he had anything to say about the reports of racial slurs and threats by his supporters against African-Americans, Latinos and gays, he replied, “Stop it.” He might as well have preceded that with, “O.K., fine … if I have to.”

Mr. Trump’s supporters and staff say he has disavowed and condemned these acts and organizations and that should be the end of it. But to many of us, this isn’t enough. It feels disingenuous and forced because we all know that when Mr. Trump has something he really wants to say, he does one thing and one thing only: He spews forth on Twitter.

Tussles with German lawmakers are nothing new for Facebook.

It has routinely run afoul of the country’s strict privacy rules. In September, a local regulator blocked WhatsApp, the internet messaging service owned by Facebook, from sharing data from users in Germany with its parent company. The country’s officials also have questioned whether Facebook’s control of users’ digital information could breach antitrust rules, accusations the company denies.

Facebook’s problems with hate speech posts in Germany began in summer 2015 as more than one million refugees began to enter the country.

Their arrival, according to company executives and lawmakers, incited an online backlash from Germans opposed to the swell of people from Syria, Afghanistan and other war-torn countries. The number of hateful posts on Facebook increased sharply.

As such content spread quickly online, senior German politicians appealed directly to Facebook to comply with the country’s laws. Even Ms. Merkel confronted Mr. Zuckerberg in New York in September 2015 about the issue.

According to a report in the Charleston newspaper The Post and Courier, Judge Gergel advised Mr. Roof against doing so, citing the expertise of a legal team led by the noted capital defense lawyer David I. Bruck. But having found Mr. Roof competent, he said the defendant had the right to self-representation under the Sixth Amendment.

“I do find the defendant has the personal capacity to self-representation,” Judge Gergel said. “I continue to believe it is strategically unwise, but it is a decision you have the right to make.”

The newspaper reported that Mr. Roof smiled slightly as he returned to the defense table, where Mr. Bruck moved over to give Mr. Roof his seat. Mr. Bruck and other members of his team will now serve as advisory “standby counsel.”

Judge Gergel, the prosecutors and Mr. Roof then began the process of winnowing a pool of 512 people down to 12 jurors and six alternates by asking about their views on the death penalty and their exposure to pretrial publicity. Mr. Roof did not often participate, according to courtroom observers, commenting on only a couple of potential jurors. Jury selection is expected to last several weeks.

Mr. Roof, 22, stands accused of killing the church’s pastor, three other ministers and five stalwarts of the congregation at a Bible study session in the fellowship hall on June 17, 2015. The gunman sat with the group for close to an hour before removing a Glock pistol from his fanny pack and opening fire while making racist comments. Two women and a child in the Bible study survived, as did the pastor’s wife and their younger daughter, who were hiding in his adjacent office. Mr. Roof was captured the next day in North Carolina.

It is uncommon but not unprecedented for capital defendants to represent themselves, and they typically do not fare well.

Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan was sentenced to death in 2013 for killing 13 people and wounding or shooting at 32 others in a 2009 rampage at Fort Hood, Tex. As his own attorney, he did not call witnesses or offer testimony, and confessed in an opening statement by explaining that he had switched sides in what he saw as an American war against Islam.

In 2015, Frazier Glenn Miller Jr. received the death penalty for killing three people at two Jewish centers in Kansas the previous year. Mr. Miller, who had a history of making anti-Semitic remarks, represented himself and shouted “Heil Hitler” in court after being sentenced.

Although New York did not have a death penalty at the time, Colin Ferguson fired his lawyers, William M. Kunstler and Ronald L. Kuby, and represented himself in his 1995 trial for a killing rampage in a Long Island Rail Road car. He received six consecutive life sentences.

Scott Panetti, a Navy veteran found to be schizophrenic, was sentenced to die in Texas for murdering the parents of his second wife in 1992 after a trial in which he represented himself while wearing a purple cowboy suit and attempted to subpoena witnesses including Jesus Christ and John F. Kennedy.

Death penalty experts said capital defendants at times chose to represent themselves to keep out evidence of their mental or emotional conditions, even though such evidence may provide the best chance to save their lives.

In Mr. Roof’s case, said John Blume, a death penalty authority at Cornell Law School, “his desire to keep his mental capacity under wraps has really jeopardized the jury’s ability to make an accurate assessment of his moral culpability.”

However, the decision could provide Mr. Roof with an unobstructed forum for his white supremacist views.

“Key issues never get raised because the defendant knows nothing about the law,” said Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “And often with mentally ill defendants whose murders were a product of their mental illness, they will attempt to justify their conduct instead of presenting evidence that their mental illness makes them less culpable.”

The judge’s decision is likely to make Mr. Roof’s trial even more traumatic for survivors and family members. “When an emotionally disturbed defendant is permitted to cross-examine those witnesses and ask questions that may be based on a delusional view of reality, it only makes things worse,” Mr. Dunham said.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/us/death-penalty-dylann-roof-charleston.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"The 17-month path to Mr. Roof’s first death penalty trial — the state of South Carolina is also seeking his execution — has been marked by public demonstrations of forgiveness and reconciliation. But the federal government’s decision to pursue Mr. Roof’s execution is widely questioned, and it is in defiance of the wishes and recommendations of survivors of the attack, many family members of the dead and some Justice Department officials. Even South Carolina’s acrimonious debate about the display of the Confederate battle flag outside the State House was less divisive in this state, polling shows.

In May, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced her decision to seek the death penalty against Mr. Roof, and critics of that choice make different, if sometimes overlapping, arguments.

Some are opposed to capital punishment in every instance because they doubt its efficacy or morality. Others argue that because a death sentence for Mr. Roof would prompt years of appeals, the decision can only protract the emotional agony of a massacre that rattled the nation. And still others contend that executing a young man like Mr. Roof, who is 22, could allow him to escape decades of punishment.

“I want that guy every morning when he wakes up, and every time he has an opportunity for quiet and solitude, to think of what Tywanza said to him: ‘We mean you no harm. You don’t have to do this,’” said Andrew J. Savage III, a Charleston lawyer, referring to Tywanza Sanders, a 26-year-old man who died in the attack. Mr. Savage represents three survivors, including Mr. Sanders’s mother, and many family members of the victims who became known here as the Emanuel Nine.

But Ms. Lynch chose to seek the death penalty after a contentious review process that included South Carolina’s top federal prosecutor siding with Mr. Roof’s defense lawyers in their offer of a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence. Ms. Lynch said that “the nature of the alleged crime and the resulting harm compelled this decision.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In a court filing the same day the attorney general made her decision public, the Justice Department cited nine aggravating factors, including that Mr. Roof had “expressed hatred and contempt towards African-Americans, as well as other groups, and his animosity toward African-Americans played a role in the murder charges in the indictment.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Prosecutors also said that Mr. Roof had “demonstrated a lack of remorse” and that he had caused “injury, harm and loss to the individuals that he killed as well as to the family, friends and co-workers of those individuals.”

The Justice Department declined to comment further for this article.

Although Ms. Lynch’s decision capped a process formally shrouded in secrecy, it was an unsurprising one to observers like Ms. Risher, who said she had felt as early as last December that prosecutors would seek the death penalty in one of the highest profile criminal matters before the Justice Department.

The case’s prominence influenced Ms. Lynch’s decision, according to people with knowledge of the Justice Department’s review, and some federal officials worried that forgoing the death penalty would effectively curb the government’s options in future cases with lower fatality counts and less public scrutiny. Some of the people insisted on anonymity to discuss a confidential process.

“I think what the federal government did is what the federal government thought it had to do, which was speak on behalf of the nation,” Mr. Savage said. “I was always told, ‘Well, Andy, if we don’t move for the death penalty in this case, when would we?’”

Such a strategy, he suggested, was to the detriment of the families of the victims.

“It’s bad enough to live with it in 2015, 2016 and 2017,” he said. “But don’t make them carry that legal cause on for 20 years.”

There were other arguments, too. When the Attorney General’s Review Committee on Capital Cases met in Washington to hear from a defense lawyer — David I. Bruck — and William N. Nettles, then the United States attorney for South Carolina, they were told that a federal death penalty trial would be duplicative of local efforts and turn greater public attention to Mr. Roof.

“I felt when I was the United States attorney that the job — and I used to preach this over and over again — was to step in when the state was either unwilling or unable,” said Mr. Nettles, who left the Justice Department in June. “The state was both willing and able to address this issue.”

Mr. Nettles otherwise declined to discuss the case. Mr. Bruck declined to comment. Members of Mr. Roof’s family have refused to discuss the case, but they said in a statement this month that they were “still struggling to understand why Dylann caused so much grief and pain to so many good people.”

The question of whether Mr. Roof should face execution surfaced soon after the killings, which happened during a Wednesday night Bible study at the whitewashed, historic church on Calhoun Street. Within 48 hours of the shootings, and less than a day after Mr. Roof was arrested, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina said on television that she “absolutely will want him to have the death penalty.”

A University of South Carolina survey, conducted last spring, found that 55 percent of South Carolina residents supported a death sentence for Mr. Roof. But divisions among black and white residents were stark: The poll showed that only 31 percent of black residents wanted Mr. Roof to face execution, while some 64 percent of whites backed the use of capital punishment in the case.

Ms. Risher knows about the divides. And as she anxiously waited for Mr. Roof’s trial to begin, she kept returning to the many flashes of doubt she has endured about her own beliefs about Mr. Roof’s fate.

Mr. de Blasio’s speech, delivered as he has begun his own re-election campaign, included several instances of call-and-response with the friendly crowd drawn from the full panoply of New York diversity, both in the seats and on the dais. An openly lesbian Protestant chaplain from the Fire Department helped to open the gathering along with an imam from the Police Department.

Mr. de Blasio spoke from a lectern adorned with a hashtag — #AlwaysNewYork — meant to inspire tales of solidarity and pride in New York values. He reminded the audience that Mr. Trump defended those values in abstract on the campaign trail during the Republican primary contests.

“We ain’t changing,” Mr. de Blasio said, before listing his promises to defend New Yorkers from deportation, unconstitutional police practices and any cuts to federal funding for Planned Parenthood. “We will ensure women receive the health care they need.”

Former city lawyers said the mayor could rely on the federalism of the Constitution as well as established case law to challenge undesired programs from Washington. It could be many more months, if not years, before the issues would be resolved in court.

The federal government may have broad authority over immigration, said Michael A. Cardozo, a partner at Proskauer who served as the corporation counsel under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Republican turned political independent. “But those laws do not give the federal government carte blanche to do whatever it wants with an immigrant.”

Since the presidential election provided a shock to residents in the city and in many areas of the state, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo have offered similar messages, appealing to Mr. Trump’s New York roots while also presenting themselves as defenders of their constituents who are worried about a new administration that neither of them supported during the campaign.

The speeches were met with derision from state Republicans on Monday. Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the state Republican Party, in a statement accused both of a “naked and unseemly fight” to position themselves for a future presidential run.

“These two scorpions in a bottle are each trying to outdo one another with slanderous fear-mongering hyperbole,"" he said.

Asked about Mr. de Blasio’s attempt to calm fearful New Yorkers, Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, mocked the mayor to reporters outside Trump Tower: “Fearful of the jobs he’s killed? Fearful of the bike lanes?”

That sentiment was repeated in the response to Mr. de Blasio’s hashtag, which for much of Monday provided a forum on Twitter for those opposed to his handling of the city to vent frustrations, as well as for supporters.

“Mayor de Blasio rolled over for the N.Y.P.D. after they did a back-turning protest,” one user wrote. “You think he won’t roll over for Trump?”

“So proud to be a New Yorker,” another wrote. “They should both be impeached,” another said of the mayor and the governor.

Even with a shared antagonist in Mr. Trump, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo have not been able to bridge the gap between them that, those close to both men say, has seemingly widened beyond repair. They have not held an event together since the election and have appeared content to go their own way in assuaging the concerns of New Yorkers, even as they end up finding very similar ways of doing so.

“We will stand up and say, ‘Yes we are black, white and brown — but we are one,’” Mr. Cuomo said in his speech.

Speaking at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem on Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, announced measures to fight the offenses, including the creation of a State Police unit that would combat what he called the “explosion of hate crimes in our state.” The new unit would consist of investigators who specialized in bias crimes and who would aid the state’s district attorneys in prosecuting them, according to the governor’s office.

Adam Yauch Park, a small triangular space in an upscale neighborhood, was thronged with hundreds of people, some of whom climbed the playground equipment and sat on the monkey bars. They lined State Street when the park became too full, holding children and shaggy dogs. One woman breast-fed an infant while she stood cheering. A few held signs that riffed on lyrics once sung by the artist and activist for whom the park was named. “No Sleep Till No Hate in Brooklyn,” one placard read, a reference to a Beastie Boys anthem.

Speakers at the rally, including Representative Nydia M. Velázquez and State Senator Daniel L.

Limited data from around the country points to an increase in hate crimes this year, but Prof. Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University in San Bernardino, cautioned that the reason for the change was unclear. Hate crimes typically spike after a “cataclysmic event” such as an election or an act of terrorism, he said. “There appears to be an increase,” Professor Levin said, “but I don’t think we can conclusively say whether they will be sustained.”

At the rally in Brooklyn, Mr. Horovitz ended his speech with some of his band’s lyrics. “Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten,” he said as the crowd recited with him. “From the Battery to the top of Manhattan / Asian, Middle Eastern and Latin / Black, white — New York, you make it happen.”

In the last few years, I’ve traveled the country to talk about bullying, as the author of a book on the topic. Parents often ask about the impact on kids when they see celebrities or leaders treat other people badly or fail to stand up to bigotry and prejudice. There’s no way to measure the precise effect. But kids are attuned to cultural expectations. They absorb shared ideas about what behavior is permitted and what is intolerable. If the president of the United States and his top officials wave away racism and harassment, or traffic in prejudice themselves, kids are at risk of getting the message that this stuff is O.K. after all. That should be obvious to anyone in elected office.

It’s also clear that if we can’t count on our national leaders to counteract bigotry, then we have to redouble our efforts to do so ourselves. When parents and alumni at Maple Grove High posted pictures of the racist graffiti on social media, the district issued a statement: “The tweet you may have seen of a racist message scrawled in a school bathroom is real and we are horrified by it. It goes against everything we stand for.” The school officials promised an investigation, acknowledged the danger to minority students and staff members, and said they would work to heal the impact on the school’s culture and “on every member of our school family.”

Those words are a start and deeds must follow, in small moments of kindness and larger acts of standing for justice. At this moment, local civil institutions and all of us, in our communities, are being put to a test. We have to show heart and conviction.

Re “Hostile Acts Against Minorities, Often Invoking Trump, Erupt Across U.S.” (news article, Nov. 11):

The fact that The New York Times was able to document so many adverse incidents on school campuses immediately after the election is reason for serious concern. It would be irresponsible to chalk up these troubling confrontations — which have overtones of discrimination and intimidation — to mere clashes of political opinion without full investigation.

And perhaps most important, to dismiss anyone’s reaction to hateful acts as oversensitive political correctness is to be complicit in these acts.

I disagree with your characterization that Wellesley was founded as a safe space. Wellesley’s founding was a revolutionary act inspired by a vision for democracy and equal opportunity for women across all socioeconomic backgrounds, and for more than 100 years, we have fought for women.

At Wellesley, we embrace difference and work to assure that all Wellesley students have an equal opportunity to flourish. We stand for equity and justice, for the pursuit of knowledge that is based in fact, and for civil discourse that is inclusive while challenging in its rigor.

It is incumbent upon President-elect Donald Trump to clearly and forcefully condemn episodes of bias against groups too numerous to name here. Far from playing it safe, Wellesley’s plan is to remain vigilant and redouble our efforts on behalf of women.

Attacks against transgender people also sharply increased.

Blacks were the most frequent victims of hate crimes based on race, while Jews were the most frequent victims based on religion, according to the F.B.I. data. But the increases in attacks on these groups were smaller than the rise in attacks against Muslims and transgender people.

Over all, 59 percent of the hate crimes that the F.B.I. recorded were based on the victims’ race, ethnicity or ancestry. Religious bias accounted for about 20 percent of all attacks, and about 18 percent of attacks were based on sexual orientation.

Advocates — like the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which is helping the family — say that many refugee families are reluctant to come forward when they become victims of hate crimes because they fear a greater backlash.

The police said that the note had been written by a 14-year-old neighbor, and that officers had talked to her and her parents but determined that no crime had been committed.

The neighbor’s family did not respond to a message requesting comment.

Criminal or not, the episode was enough to stir up a response — an effort to counter intolerance.

Alta Haywood, a retired teacher who lives in Perry Hall, Md., sent the family a towering fruit basket and included a note that read in part, “I sincerely hope that other people in the area show you that they can be kind and accepting.”

Another gift-giver, Dr. Lindsay Fitch, said the news of what had happened to the family “just grabbed me more personally.” While talking to her two children about it, she said, she decided to send the family the most American of welcomes: a home-baked apple pie and a pumpkin pie.

Included in her card were a photograph of her family and an invitation to have their families get together. “I wanted to welcome you to the Baltimore area,” she wrote. “There are a lot of people here who want to welcome you with open arms. Hopefully, you’ll find that welcome. Remember us when you encounter ugliness.”

The Southern Poverty Law Center created a web page on Thursday to funnel the reports, and received more than 200 within 24 hours. They also started an online petition, which had more than 35,000 signatures as of Friday, asking Mr. Trump to condemn the behavior.

Many online attacks have stemmed from a small number of accounts, but have been shared widely, amplifying their effects, according to groups that monitor hate speech.

Analyzing hate crime data to identify trends can take months, Mr. Levin said. In the meantime, he said, it will be important to monitor nonviolent activity like vandalism, verbal altercations and conflict on social media, which can escalate to violence.

While many of the widely shared complaints of harassment do not constitute criminal activity, they are stirring fear among marginalized groups.

Feeling helpless, Iman Zawahry, who is Muslim, turned to Facebook to share with friends what her 12-year-old son had experienced in school in Gainesville, Fla. The boy, whose United States-born parents are of Egyptian descent, had come home complaining that his seventh grade classmates teased him about Mr. Trump’s victory and accused him of being part of the Islamic State.

Some abuse has been met with an outpouring of support. After black freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania received racist cellphone messages, including threats of lynching, en masse, classmates placed a huge safety pin in a campus quad to signify solidarity with them.

If Mr. Trump were to publicly condemn acts of prejudice, experts say, it could have a neutralizing effect because those who express hatred tend to respond to cues from role models. Mr. Trump signaled, in his victory speech on Wednesday morning, that his language may move in that direction, saying, “To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.”

Mr. Levin, at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, said, “The more conciliatory he is, I think the better it will be because people look toward the media and role models as to how to frame their viewpoints.”

At the same time, Mr. Cohen at the Southern Poverty Law Center and his colleagues noted that no matter how Mr. Trump proceeds as president, the extremist groups that supported him, whose enthusiasm has been stoked by the election, are likely to react. And because of that, those seeking to tamp down hate fueled by race, religion or sexual orientation are “between a rock and a hard place.”

“The rock is that these ideas will play a role in his administration,” Mr. Cohen said. “The hard place is that when they don’t, there will be a furious backlash because of the raised expectations.”",nytimes.com,True

In his victory speech early Wednesday morning, Donald Trump pledged that he “will be president for all Americans,” and he asked those who did not support him “for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.”



Here’s some guidance right off the bat, Mr. President-elect: Those sentiments will have more force if you immediately and unequivocally repudiate the outpouring of racist, sexist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and homophobic insults, threats and attacks being associated with your name. Do this in a personal plea to people who supported your candidacy. Tell them this is not what you stand for, nor is it what your new administration will tolerate.

Explicit expressions of bigotry and hatred by Trump supporters were common throughout the campaign, and they have become even more intense since his election. On a department-store window in Philadelphia, vandals spray-painted “Sieg Heil 2016” and Mr. Trump’s name written with a swastika. In a Minnesota high-school bathroom, vandals scrawled the Trump campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” and next to it, “Go back to Africa.” There are many more reports pouring in of verbal and physical harassment of Muslims, Latinos and other members of minorities. Though not all are verifiable, the atmosphere of intimidation and fear is unquestionably real and will keep growing. Mr. Trump may not be able to stop it by himself, but he must do everything he can.

The problem, of course, is that Mr. Trump’s campaign was based on appeals — some explicit, some coded — to racial and ethnic resentment and division. His followers heard it starting with his speech declaring his candidacy, warning of Mexican immigrant “rapists,” continuing to a rally last weekend where he promised to bar all Syrian refugees because they “will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities.” These statements emboldened and even encouraged those who have been looking for a license to lash out against immigrants, refugees, minorities and anyone else they find threatening.

The city of Orlando announced plans this week to purchase the Pulse Nightclub, the site of the deadliest mass shooting in United States history, and turn it into a memorial.

The popular gay club has been empty since June 12, when a gunman opened fire during a Latin-themed dance party, killing 49 people and wounding dozens more. The gunman was shot and killed in a shootout with the police, ending the siege.

Buddy Dyer, the mayor of Orlando, said that it was important for the city to take control of the site to ensure that those killed and injured were properly honored.

“It has great significance not just for the L.G.B.T.Q. community and for the Hispanic community but for all of us that live and love Orlando,” Mr. Dyer said in a video statement posted on Twitter. “I think it is very important that city take control of the site.”

Blacks, Asians, gays and people with disabilities also reported abuse. Britain recorded 71,140 hate crimes in the 2015-16 financial year, ending in March. In July, the month after the referendum, the number of hate crimes recorded by the police was 41 percent higher than in July of last year, though they have fallen lately.

All in all, it is a numerical portrait of a society in the grip of hatred and bigotry. Except the statistics are misleading, said Mark Hamilton, the assistant chief constable of the Northern Ireland police, who leads Britain’s hate crime policy for the National Police Chiefs’ Council.

“In most cases, it’s not a rise in hate crimes. It’s a rise in reporting,” he said in an interview in his Belfast office. Since hate crimes are generally underrecorded, he said, “our national strategy is to increase the level of hate crime reporting.”

The number of reported hate crimes in Britain has risen for two reasons: increased public awareness and changes in the law so that almost anything can be recorded as a hate crime so long as the victim experiences a verbal or physical assault as such. Many of the changes stem from the racially charged murder of Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old black man who was stabbed while waiting for a bus in 1993.

Many crimes counted in the statistics are registered through True Vision, a government-funded website that allows anyone to anonymously report what they have experienced or witnessed as a hate crime.

Rather than a hotbed of racial hatred, then, Britain is more a country that takes hate crime seriously and encourages citizens to report such acts when they occur. Far from painting Britain as a xenophobic society, Mr. Hamilton said, the numbers point to greater intolerance among Britons directed not at foreigners, but at hateful behavior toward them. The figures also suggest that public trust in the police is improving, he said.

Although the so-called Brexit vote “created a license” for some to lash out, Mr. Hamilton said, “if we look at what we’re reporting, we’re not reporting massive numbers of serious crime.”

Data from the Home Office published last month showed that more than half of all hate crimes were categorized as threatening but nonviolent behavior. Still, a third involved some physical violence.

Excluding online hate crimes, which are difficult for the authorities to monitor, police data show that about 82 percent of hate crimes are racially or religiously motivated, including ones related to anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. The remainder are crimes against gays, transsexuals and people with disabilities, which the police consider to be badly underreported.

Interest groups have their own counts. Community Security Trust, a British charity, said anti-Semitic incidents rose 11 percent year on year in the first six months of 2016, after totaling 924 in 2015. Tell Mama, which tracks Islamophobia, said it had received 1,128 reports in 2015, more than double those in the previous year. European embassies in Britain have also logged dozens of incidents against their citizens, mostly from Eastern Europe.

But because the official figures do not break down hate crimes by religion, it is difficult to verify such counts.

The rate of prosecution varies across the four countries that make up Britain. In England and Wales, about a quarter of reported hate crimes were prosecuted last year. In Scotland, the rate was about 80 percent, while in Northern Ireland, it was more than half.

Once brought to court, more than four in five hate crime prosecutions result in conviction in Britain.

“The police response has improved in a lot of ways,” said Neil Chakraborti, a criminology professor and the director of the Center for Hate Studies at Leicester University. “Britain has a clear set of laws, a policy that is victim-led, and there is a collective endeavor” to tackle hate crime.

The shift to a perception-based definition of hate crimes emerged from the Lawrence case.

The police were dogged by allegations that Mr. Lawrence had been denied first aid because of his race, and that they had run a smear campaign against his family and supporters who criticized how the authorities conducted proceedings.

A subsequent government inquiry described the London Metropolitan Police as “institutionally racist.” It said there had been a “collective failure” by the authorities “through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.”

Although the British police still struggle with minority relations, officials say the recognition of racism in the police force drastically changed the mind-set inside the organization.

Most of the recommendations made by the report were put into practice shortly after its publication in 1999.

The police are now subject to greater public scrutiny. The handling of racist incidents is closely monitored, as are stop-and-search procedures. The police routinely measure how satisfied minorities are with their service. Officers are given racial awareness training, and there have been efforts to make the force more racially diverse, even though the number of minorities remains disproportionately low.

Some of the changes also came about because of the 1998 Human Rights Act, which incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law. It enshrined, among other things, an individual’s right to life, humane treatment and fair trial. In addition, the Human Rights Act requires minimal use of force and firearms by police officers.

“The threading of human rights through every response of the police service has been a fundamental element in changing how we go about our business and how we view how we do our business,” Mr. Hamilton said. “It’s a superb thing.”

Mr. Hamilton is based in Belfast, once called the hate crime capital of Europe because of Northern Ireland’s long history of sectarian violence between mostly Protestant pro-British unionists and mostly Roman Catholic pro-Irish republicans.

Given the history, the police force in Northern Ireland has led Britain’s hate crime strategy for 20 years out of a bunkerlike compound on the outskirts of Belfast.

Tensions remain, but the reframing of hate crimes and a greater emphasis on human rights in British law also had an impact here.

Sectarian crimes in Northern Ireland are now categorized as hate crimes, which officials say has encouraged more people to come forward. But mistrust of the police still runs deep, and reports of hate crimes in Northern Ireland are generally lower than in England and Wales. (Leaflets recently pasted on street lamps urged citizens not to give information to the police.)

Today, anyone caught painting a fresh mural seen as inciting racial hatred can be prosecuted for a hate crime.

“In recent years, we’ve had a collective courage to name hate crime for what it is,” Mr. Hamilton said, adding that most people develop hatred for other communities because they themselves have suffered.

Urban areas across the country, including Oakland, Calif.; Washington; and Brooklyn have also battled anti-gentrification movements, but typically the ire has been directed at developers and city hall. In Boyle Heights, the anger is focused almost entirely on the art galleries, which they portray as outsiders that are simply harbingers of real estate speculators looking to make money off the lower-income neighborhood.

Mr. Nicodim opened his gallery two years ago, after operating a smaller space in Chinatown. An immigrant from Romania, he has lived in Boyle Heights for more than a decade. For a year, he said, he ran the gallery with no problem. Now, he said, “It has escalated to the point where it feels dangerous.”

“There is this perception that if you are doing art you are this rich white guy from Beverly Hills,” he said. “But I am not this rich white guy. I came to this country with $36 in my pocket. And it’s pretty sad that after 30 years I am being told to go back where you came from.”

The activists in the neighborhood are making no apologies for the radical tactics and portray themselves as defenders of working-class neighborhoods in the city. They look to other neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Silver Lake, that were once working class and are now filled with upscale bakeries that sell artisan doughnuts and have replaced mom-and-pop taco shops and locally owned grocery stores.

“We think of gentrification as displacement and white supremacy,” said Nancy Meza, an organizer of Defend Boyle Heights, a group that formed nearly a year ago and has organized most of the protests against the galleries. Ms. Meza said that some gallery owners brought dogs out to intimidate local residents walking the street. “These galleries are coming in and trying to replace the current culture that is already in Boyle Heights. They are not looking to attract members of our communities.”

As the protests have built in recent months, many gallery owners have tried to ignore them. Mr. Nicodim did not report either episode in front of his gallery to the police. But somebody did. After Capt. Rick Stabile saw reports of three separate cases of vandalism targeting what was labeled white art, he said it was “common sense” to pursue the acts as hate crimes because they were targeting the owners based on race. There are no suspects so far, but a hate crime conviction is punishable by up to a year in jail. After the episodes, he organized a meeting of the gallery owners and promised them a greater police presence for gallery openings.

“Everyone has a right to protest, but when it becomes a hate crime, we have a problem in the area that we really need to address,” Captain Stabile said. “The concern is this getting more out of hand.”

As rents across the city have skyrocketed, gentrification has been a persistent worry for longtime residents of Boyle Heights. Some welcome the changes, which include a bustling subway station in Mariachi Plaza and improvements to local parks and schools that had been neglected for decades. More recently, Chicano residents who grew up in the area but left for college have begun to move back in, opening their own businesses in the area — a process they’ve referred to as gentefication, a play on gentrification and gente, Spanish for people.

Self Help Graphics and Art, a nonprofit that has worked in the area for more than 40 years, has held forums about the pitfalls of gentrification for years. The vast majority of residents in the neighborhood are renters, many living with a near constant threat of eviction. When the group opened its doors for such a meeting this summer, a dozen activists came in and took control of the microphone, holding signs that read “Out with the galleries, out with the sellouts.”

Betty Avila, the associate director of Self Help, said it was unfair to conflate the nonprofit, which focuses on exhibiting Latino artists, with the galleries that have opened up on Anderson Street, the industrial-looking strip that has been drawing the art collectors east of the Los Angeles River. But Ms. Avila shares many of the protesters’ concerns.

“Residents see that the neighborhood is attracting more people who would have never come in here before, and they see people who are interested in living here who can’t afford downtown looking to move here,” she said. “You have a community that is really frustrated and afraid of being displaced. The galleries are the most visible sign of change now, and you go after what you see. It’s not all art; it’s art that’s not for this community.”

The gallery owners see the focus on race as misplaced and unfair. After Eva Chimento opened Chimento Contemporary last year, she said, two activists came into her gallery, threatened her and demanded that she show Latino artists. This summer, she attended a Defend Boyle Heights meeting only to be shouted down by activists.

Ms. Chimento said she refuses to discuss her ethnicity with the activists, but she has shown several local artists and is preparing an exhibition with two Puerto Rican artists about immigration. She has repeatedly told activists that she hires from the community and welcomes local residents into the space. This year, she took down the sign from her gallery to try to deflect threats. And she no longer uses local banks or restaurants out of fear of being recognized and targeted.

“I’ve been scared and nervous and jumpy. In the beginning I wanted to leave, but now it’s principle,” she said. “To say that white galleries need to leave, so they can decide what goes in their spaces, it’s an unrealistic expectation.

“We feel that the quote that was placed on the church was basically, it’s an intimidation of someone’s right to vote whatever way they choose to vote,” he said. “So that would be definitely considered a hate crime.”

But “as far it being a racial issue,” he added, “I can’t say that.”

The F.B.I. office in Jackson, the state capital, released a brief statement saying that it was “working with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to determine if any civil rights crimes were committed.” The state fire marshal and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also assisting with the investigation.

Mississippi’s secretary of state, Delbert Hosemann, said Wednesday that he had been in contact with “authorities in Greenville” and the state Highway Patrol about the attack. Those discussions led him to believe that the burning and vandalism were not committed by “somebody of a political nature,” he said.

“The initial work here indicates this is not of a political nature even though there may be something that says ‘Vote Trump’ on the side of the church,” said Mr. Hosemann, a Republican. “So everybody needs to calm down here until we get to the bottom of this.”

The attack occurred a little more than two weeks after a local Republican headquarters in Hillsborough, N.C., was firebombed, and graffiti were discovered with a swastika and the message “Nazi Republicans leave town or else.” No one has been arrested in that attack.

It also follows months of racially charged campaign speech from Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. Though Mr. Trump has portrayed himself as a friend of African-Americans and has vowed to make their lives better, he has garnered the support of many white supremacists and white nationalists. Some of his supporters have darkly predicted riots and even revolution if he loses to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, on Tuesday. His campaign this week disavowed support from The Crusader, a Ku Klux Klan newspaper.

Mr. Trump is heavily favored to win in Mississippi, a state where about 60 percent of the population is white.

At the news conference, Mayor Simmons, an African-American, called the racial climate in Greenville “fairly good,” though he noted a racial slur had been found painted on a boat ramp Sept. 11.

Like much of the Mississippi Delta, Greenville has struggled economically and has worked to overcome the legacy of slavery. In the mid-20th century, as African-Americans struggled to integrate the Deep South, church bombings were among the ugliest acts of retaliation by recalcitrant white racists.

Greenville today is about 20 percent white and 78 percent black, and the public schools are virtually all black. But Mr. Simmons noted that blacks and whites now pray together every fifth Sunday as part of an event he created.

The mayor said he visited church members Wednesday. “I talked to folks who were fearful,” he said. “I talked to people who were intimidated. I talked to people who, quite frankly, were saddened and crying last night. This should not happen in 2016. It happened in the ’50s. It happened in the ’60s. But we’re in 2016.”

In a separate phone interview on Wednesday, the mayor said race relations in the city had not really changed with the rise of Mr. Trump. But he blamed the Republican candidate for coarsening the national mood, and said extremists were using his remarks “as an excuse to show their true colors.”

Also on Wednesday, about three dozen people gathered in a park along the Greenville waterfront to pray and speak about healing and the primacy of faith over politics. Joining a Methodist preacher, an Episcopal priest and a synagogue president in the cool of the night was Alice Washington, a member of Hopewell.

“What’s happening with Chobani is one more flash point in this battle between the voices of xenophobia and the voices advocating a rational immigration policy,” said Cecillia Wang, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.

Chobani and Mr. Ulukaya declined to comment for this article. The Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment.

Mr. Ulukaya arrived in upstate New York in the 1990s to attend school. By 2002, he was making and selling feta cheese inspired by a family recipe. A few years later, he learned that a local yogurt and cheese factory that had closed was for sale. He received a loan of $800,000 from the Small Business Administration to purchase the factory, and started selling Chobani yogurt in 2007.

As the business grew, Mr. Ulukaya needed more help. When he learned there was a refugee resettlement center in a nearby town, he asked if any of the newcomers wanted jobs at Chobani. Mr. Ulukaya provided transportation for the new hires, and he brought in translators to assist them. He paid the refugee workers salaries above the minimum wage, as he did other workers at the factory.

When Chobani opened its factory in Twin Falls, Mr. Ulukaya once again turned to a local resettlement center. The company now employs resettled refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey, among other countries.

“The minute a refugee has a job, that’s the minute they stop being a refugee,” Mr. Ulukaya said in a talk he gave this year.

Today, Chobani has annual yogurt sales of around $1.5 billion. Last year, Mr. Ulukaya signed the Giving Pledge, promising to give away a majority of his fortune to assist refugees.

Chobani and the other companies working with refugees are not exploiting them, said Jennifer Patterson, project director for the Partnership for Refugees, a federal program.

“It’s the exact opposite,” Ms. Patterson said. “These companies are looking to provide resettled refuges with the ability to live happy and productive lives.”

Chobani’s work with refugees went largely unnoticed until this January, when Mr. Ulukaya spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. His message — that corporations needed to do more to assist refugees — broke through the high-minded rhetoric.

“He was quite a sensation there,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who attended the event. “Here was someone who went beyond the well-meaning chatter of Davos and was walking the walk.”

But while an alliance of well-known companies was now working together on the issue, the online critics zeroed in on Chobani. Shortly after Mr. Ulukaya spoke in Davos, the far-right website WND published a story originally titled “American Yogurt Tycoon Vows to Choke U.S. With Muslims.”

Then this summer, Breitbart, the conservative news website whose former executive chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, is now running the Trump campaign, began publishing a series of misleading articles about Chobani.

One drew a connection between Chobani’s hiring of refugees and a spike in tuberculosis cases in Idaho. Another linked Chobani to a “Twin Falls Crisis Imposed by Clinton-Era Pro-Refugee Advocates.” A third conflated Chobani’s hiring practices with a sexual assault case in Twin Falls involving minors.

As Breitbart began publishing its articles, the online attacks grew more intense. On Twitter and Facebook, users called for a boycott of Chobani. An image was widely shared on social media that claimed Mr. Ulukaya was “going to drown the United States in Muslims and is importing them to Idaho 300 at a time to work in his factory.” And bloggers fabricated stories claiming that Chobani was pressuring local officials “to facilitate their multitude of Muslim friendly/Islamification requests.”

Soon the mayor of Twin Falls, Shawn Barigar, found himself at the center of a conspiracy theory.

“It got woven into a narrative that it’s all a cover-up, that we’re all trying to keep the refugees safe so that Chobani has its work force, that I personally am getting money from the Obama administration to help Chobani hire whoever they want, that it’s part of this Islamification of the United States,” he said. “It’s crazy.”

As the online comments escalated this summer, Mr. Barigar and his wife received death threats.

Breitbart said it was simply covering the news.

“Breitbart has been a leader in delivering important and breaking news on refugee crises throughout the Western world, which pose both national security and financial risks,” Alex Marlow, editor in chief, said in a statement. “Mr. Ulukaya hasn’t merely involved himself in this issue, he’s been one of the leaders in expanding refugee resettlement in the United States. Breitbart’s explosive growth is due in large measure to the mainstream media’s refusal to cover vital topics like this one.”

But civil rights advocates said they believed it was no mystery why Mr. Ulukaya was targeted while other chief executives had been spared. “It’s because he’s an immigrant himself,” Ms. Wang of the A.C.L.U. said.

Mr. Roth of Human Rights Watch attributed some of the xenophobia directed at Chobani to the election season.

“Some people are feeling left behind, and some people are concerned about terrorists,” he said. “But Trump has given a voice to these sentiments.”

Mr. Barigar, a Democrat, concurred. “Donald Trump really fueled a sentiment about immigration that is shared by a very small part of our community,” he said. “We are an agricultural center. We’ve depended on immigrants for a half-century or more.”

Mr. Ulukaya appears undeterred. In September, he participated in a round-table discussion with President Obama and business leaders on how corporations could do more to help refugees.

And his work with refugees is part of a broader suite of initiatives. He recently gave 10 percent of Chobani shares to his employees, and he is offering paid parental leave to all employees.

“He’s the xenophobe’s nightmare,” Mr. Roth said. “Here’s an immigrant who isn’t competing for jobs, but is creating jobs big time. It runs completely counter to the far-right narrative.”",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Ravi was convicted in 2012 after the case prompted a furor over the bullying of gay teenagers like Mr. Clementi, an accomplished violinist who leapt from the George Washington Bridge in 2010. Mr. Clementi’s story was embraced by advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights.

In a statement, Mr. Clementi’s parents, Joe and Jane Clementi, who started the Tyler Clementi Foundation to combat bullying, said: “We have learned a lot through this process of pleas, convictions, time served and appeals. We learned at the trial that what happened to Tyler was a lot worse than what was initially related to us.”

“We have learned that our legislators need to make constitutionally valid and clear laws,” the statement continued. “And we have learned that witnesses or bystanders need to become upstanders for those in our society like Tyler, who cannot stand up for themselves.”

Prosecutors did not charge Mr. Ravi in the death of Mr. Clementi, who left no explanation for his suicide. But shortly before his death, Mr. Clementi learned that Mr. Ravi had spied on him with a webcam and used social media to encourage others to view his having sex with another man in the dorm room they shared.

In a Twitter message, for example, Mr. Ravi said: “Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into molly’s room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.”

Some of the charges that Mr. Ravi was convicted of fell under a state statute on bias intimidation that was ruled unconstitutional last year by the New Jersey Supreme Court. The statute said defendants could be convicted if their victims “reasonably believed” they were harassed or intimidated because of a characteristic such as race or sexual orientation.

The appeals court dismissed those charges and said that the evidence prosecutors used to prove them had “tainted the jury’s verdict on the remaining charges,” thus depriving Mr. Ravi of a fair trial.

On Thursday, Mr. Ravi wore a trim slate-blue suit, a collarless dress shirt with no tie and tan shoes. Before his hearing he kept his eyes on his cellphone. He had a full black beard that contrasted starkly with the smooth-faced, grinning school portrait circulated widely after his arrest.

When asked by the judge if he had any statement to make before he was sentenced, Mr. Ravi responded, “I have nothing to say.”

Steven D. Altman, Mr. Ravi’s lawyer, said he would file a motion for his client’s criminal record to be expunged, so Mr. Ravi, who is from India, could apply for United States citizenship and move on with his life.

“He just wants to disappear,” Mr. Altman said outside the courtroom.

After his original conviction, Mr. Ravi apologized and served 20 days in jail on some of the charges and was ordered to pay $10,000 to a program aiding victims of hate crimes and to perform community service. But his apology was dismissed by Mr. Clementi’s parents as a “public relations piece.”

The appeals court judges, while overturning Mr. Ravi’s conviction, nonetheless censured his actions in the strongest terms.

“The social environment that transformed a private act of sexual intimacy into a grotesque voyeuristic spectacle must be unequivocally condemned in the strongest possible way,” the opinion said. “The fact that this occurred in a university dormitory, housing first-year college students, only exacerbates our collective sense of disbelief and disorientation.”

No friends or relatives of Mr. Clementi were in the courtroom on Thursday. A prosecutor, Christie Bevacqua, said she spoke to Mr. Clementi’s parents as well as the lawyer for the man with whom he had a tryst.

“Both have been consulted and are aware of this decision today,” she said.

Ms. Bevacqua added that she had explained to them that based on the likelihood that the state would lose an appeal of the appellate court’s overturning of Mr. Ravi’s original convictions, she agreed to the plea agreement.

Before the hearing, Mr. Ravi could be overheard saying that he felt he had to fight the original charges because, “I didn’t really have a choice” and “I didn’t know what my future was going to be like.”

He added, “It’s amazing how fast the world moves on, especially these days.”

Afterward he could be heard saying that he was relieved. Moments before Mr. Ravi left the courtroom, joined by his parents, who said the family would not comment, Judge Joseph Paone gave him some parting words.

The government’s move has ignited a fierce debate. Criminalizing hate speech, opponents say, would have a chilling effect on another hard-won victory: freedom of expression. Under the proposed law, hate speech would be broadly defined as direct or electronic communication that “advocates hatred,” incites violence or causes contempt or ridicule.

A first-time offender could be punished by up to three years in prison, and a repeat offender could face imprisonment of up to 10 years.

Beyond the stiff penalties, critics say, the proposed law would also distract from the real problems in South Africa, where blacks have political power but where economic power and cultural influence remain disproportionately in the hands of whites, who account for only 9 percent of the population.

“Race and racism should be understood as structural problems, problems of inequality, to be resolved through a program of justice and not criminalization,” said Joel Modiri, a lecturer in jurisprudence at the University of Pretoria. “Here you have a black-majority society that is essentially demanding protection from a white minority. It’s revealing the deeper problem that you have a majority in this country that is fundamentally powerless.”

By adopting such a law, South Africa would join Britain, Canada, France, Germany and other countries where hate speech is a crime.

But it would move further away from the United States, a country with which it shares a history of racism by whites against blacks. In the United States, the First Amendment protects almost all expression, no matter how offensive.

In February, Ms. Momberg was caught in Johannesburg verbally abusing the black officers.

The video, which spread across the internet in South Africa, shows Ms. Momberg, apparently angry at how long it took the police to respond, yelling that she did not want the assistance of a black officer. She said she wanted to be helped by an official who was white, Indian or mixed race.

“One kaffir is bad enough,” she said. “This happens all the time, all the time. The kaffirs here in Joburg are terrible. I’m so sick of it.” She is also heard calling black people “opinionated,” “arrogant” and “useless.” Later in the video, she says that if she sees a black person, “I will drive him over.”

“If I have a gun I will shoot everybody,” she adds.

The South African Human Rights Commission has said it will also take Ms. Momberg to the Equality Court, a body established in the post-apartheid era to deal with discrimination.

While South Africa’s post-apartheid Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, it excludes “advocacy of hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.” An act passed in 2000 broadened the definition of hate speech to include expressions that are “hurtful” and “harmful” or that will “incite harm” or “promote or propagate hatred.”

Pierre de Vos, a constitutional scholar at the University of Cape Town, said the country was already “quite aggressive in targeting hate speech.”

“Given our history, the people who drafted our Constitution assumed that although freedom of expression is very important, hate speech cannot under any circumstance serve any valuable purpose,” he said.

Last month, a high court judge ordered a white man named Wayne Swanepoel to pay 100,000 rand, or about $7,000, for using the epithet against a black man during an argument. The judge said the word “cannot be heard without flinching.”

Critics say that too broadly defining hate speech will erode freedom of expression and do little to heal the country’s racial wounds.

“You cannot legislate for good human behavior; you cannot legislate for social cohesion,” said Tusi Fokane, the executive director of the Freedom of Expression Institute, a private organization. “Given our past, a lot more will be required than banning and criminalizing expressions.”

The difficulty in defining hate speech is evident in the differences between the Constitution and the 2000 act, experts said. Even the most explosive slur would be considered hate speech under the act, but would not automatically be labeled such under the Constitution.

The offensive word is derived from the Arabic word “kafir,” meaning nonbeliever or non-Muslim. Over the centuries in South Africa its usage changed, eventually becoming a racist term.

“The K-word here and the N-word in the States are essentially vehicles for expressing hate, a way of demeaning another person to make them less than what you are,” said Millard Arnold, 60, an American who has lived in South Africa for more than two decades and is a trustee of the Steve Biko Foundation, a community development organization. “In both societies, those two words resonate virtually the same way.”

If the offending South African word was widely used during apartheid, it is now taboo.

“While I was growing up, some books made reference to it, but it was always used in a historical context,” said Ramabina Mahapa, 24, a former president of the student council at the University of Cape Town, who grew up in a rural area. “Nobody has ever called me that.”

Last year, when the student council participated in a movement to remove a statue of the colonial-era businessman Cecil Rhodes from campus, Mr. Mahapa received racist emails calling him a monkey or baboon, but never this particular epithet, he said. That fact, to him, put the word in a different category.

Trevor Noah, the South African host of “The Daily Show,” tried to strip the word of its singular power in his 2012 stand-up show, “That’s Racist.” Like some black Americans who have tried to re-appropriate the N-word, Mr. Noah said he wanted to turn the South African equivalent into a positive term and even start a National Kaffir Day.

The attempt fizzled, an indication that South Africa was not ready for the word.

“I understood the attempt,” Kagiso Lediga, a prominent stand-up comedian, said in an interview. “It was well spirited, and it came from a good place, trying to make it into a good word. But leave it alone. That’s ground zero there in terms of words. That’s straight-up heavy radiation there.”",nytimes.com,True

Prosecutors say the three men held “antigovernment, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs,” and researchers say their arrest came as the number of anti-Muslim crimes in the United States is soaring.

Hate crimes in the United States against Muslims and people perceived as Arab have reached the highest level since just after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, new data shows. Researchers say the increase is a backlash against terrorist attacks in places like Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., and the result of anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim language by politicians.

In Garden City, Mr. Mohamed said his instinct after he learned of the plot was to pack up and leave. Like many others here, he had fled unrest and extremist militants in Somalia. Mr. Mohamed’s brother had been killed by the extremist group the Shabab, and his wife and children moved to Uganda. Many Somali refugees were resettled in Kansas in the mid-2000s.

Mr. Mohamed said he had been one of the first Somalis to settle in Garden City, about seven years ago, crossing the plains in a caravan of minivans with other Somalis after their old meatpacking plant in Nebraska shut down.

Somali residents spend Thanksgivings and Halloweens in the houses of lifelong Garden City families, and they welcome their non-Somali neighbors over for Muslim holidays.

The growth of the Somali community has further changed the face of a region that was already increasingly less white. Here in Finney County, white residents made up 70 percent of the population in 1990. Now, they represent 43 percent, according to census figures. In schools, 79 percent of children are nonwhite, and notices to parents are sent home in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and Burmese.

A brief statement from Mr. Stein’s mother, Hattie, said, “We do not support discrimination of any sort and have never advocated or condoned violence.”

They planned to pack four vehicles with explosives, leave them at the one-story apartments where many Somali and Burmese families live, and detonate them using a cellphone.

After the men were arrested, the authorities said they found guns, nearly a metric ton of ammunition, possible bomb-making components and a copy of “The Anarchist Cookbook,” which includes instructions on making explosives.

“We’re going to talk about killing people and going to prison for life,” Mr. Allen said during one meeting, according to the federal authorities. “Less than 60 days, maybe 40 days until something major happens.”

According to the police, two months after taking advantage of the Brooklyn woman, Ms. Su victimized another in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, for $19,000. She also committed the scheme in Manhattan and Flushing, Queens, stealing more than $400,000, they said.

The authorities said she worked with two associates, who have not been arrested.

The arrest was the result of a rather busy summer in the blessing scam business. Deputy Chief Joseph V. Dowling of the New York Police Department’s grand larceny division said there had been seven cases of this type of fraud in the city since the beginning of the year, most of them over the summer.

So far, the authorities said, they had arrested four of eight suspects, including three suspects indicted in Brooklyn in September and charged with stealing $85,000 from one 62-year-old woman.

The police believe the other four fled back to China. The perpetrators, Chief Dowling said, all came from the southwestern city of Maoming, in Guangdong province. They entered the United States through Canada or via a tourist visa.

The profits from the crimes were substantial: more than $600,000 in cash and jewelry. The police have been able to recover only $11,000, they said.

Ms. Su pleaded not guilty. Her court-appointed lawyer, Morris Shamuil, said that Ms. Su, herself, was a victim, akin to a woman forced into prostitution. “She informed me she was smuggled into this country and promised citizenship, legal residency and a job doing housekeeping,” Mr. Shamuil said. “She was told that if she wanted to stay in this country, she would have to do what she was told, or be thrown out on the street.”

Mr. Shamuil said that Ms. Su flew from China to Canada and then was smuggled into the United States and that she had told him she did not receive any of the money.

Judge Danny Chun set bail at $250,000.

Chinese immigrant associations in New York are aware of the blessing scheme, and over the last two years have conducted education workshops with older people, providing tip sheets. So, too, have elder abuse and immigrant fraud divisions of the Manhattan district attorney’s office and the Brooklyn district attorney’s office, which created the Immigrant Fraud Unit in 2014.

Often, according to prosecutors in Brooklyn and Manhattan, victims do not report the crime because they do not speak English, or because they lack legal status or are worried they would forfeit government benefits if they revealed they had been holding large amounts of cash.

Chief Dowling said that while the crime seemed to be on the upswing now, its high point was in 2012 and 2013. “We were getting hit to a larger degree; there was probably 70 cases back then,” he said.

While the death surprised few Franco-Asians, it did reveal a volatile racial landscape in France that is far more complex than the country’s French majority and large Muslim minority, whose struggle for integration has received the most attention.

In early September, 60,000 demonstrators of Chinese or other Asian origin marched in Paris to denounce violence and discrimination and to press the government for more vigorous action to ensure the safety of all French citizens, no matter their race. They waved French flags, wore T-shirts emblazoned with the tricolor, and sang “La Marseillaise.”

Racial discrimination and violence, many in the community lament, is a problem that has long defied remedy. Six years ago, people of Chinese origin similarly protested racial violence aimed at them in Paris’s Belleville neighborhood, in the 10th Arrondisement, an area with a large Chinese community.

“In 2010, there were lots of thefts and beatings,” said Frédéric Zhou, Mr. Zhang’s former landlord, who recounted his own instances of verbal abuse and physical threats. “We protested, and the authorities said they would try to stop these attacks. But in six years, it’s gotten worse, and now there’s a death.

“One death isn’t nothing,” he added. “We’re not dogs.”

While conditions in Belleville did improve, violence against people of Asian descent in some other areas appears to have increased. Mr. Zhang’s death followed a steady uptick of violence in Aubervilliers, residents say.

Joelle Huy, the president of the owners’ cooperative of La Résidence du Parc, a majority Chinese housing complex in La Courneuve, a suburb adjacent to Aubervilliers, described an attack on the night of July 13.

“A group of about 10 kids started shooting fireworks at our cars,” she recalled. Residents of the housing complex chased the youths away and called the police. “When the police arrived,” Ms. Huy said, “we told them that this couldn’t go on, and they told us it was nothing.”

A few minutes after the police left, the youths emerged from the darkness with pistols. “They were firing in all directions,” Ms. Huy said, still clearly shocked. “Four people were wounded by bullets.”

During the first seven months of 2016, the police recorded 105 violent thefts targeting Aubervilliers’s residents of Chinese origin, who number 3,000 in a town of more than 77,000 inhabitants. The reported assaults were probably only a fraction of the actual total, because many in the community feel it is useless to go to the police.

“To file a complaint, it takes three hours, the police say they don’t understand the Chinese people, or they say they’re not taking complaints,” said Ms. Huy, who blames government indifference as much as the perpetrators for the violence. “What’s the point? You try to file a complaint, you are rejected.”

The attack at La Courneuve prompted such concern that Chinese in France wrote to the Interior Ministry warning that the situation was growing dire.

“In the letter, they said, ‘What will it take for the government to react?’” recounted Tamara Lui, the president of the Chinese of France-French of China Association. “‘Does someone need to die?’”

A few weeks later, Mr. Zhang did.

The threat has grown so bad, and the lack of government response so enraging, that some Chinese have taken their security into their own hands.

“They organize groups that can accompany people when they leave their homes,” said Sun Lay Tan, a municipal councilor in Mitry-Mory, a suburb of Paris, and the author of a Change.org petition denouncing anti-Asian violence that garnered more than 15,000 signatures. “It’s going to continue because when they call the police, they don’t come.”

Sabrina Goldman, the vice president of the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism, said the lack of response had engendered “a sense of fatalism” among Chinese. But she also noted that since Mr. Zhang’s death, the problem of anti-Asian violence had gained more recognition. “Racism against the Chinese and Asian communities has long been ignored, and now society is waking up to its existence,” she said.

In September, a court in Bobigny, another Paris suburb, sentenced three young men implicated in the violent mugging of a Chinese family and, for the first time, recognized the crime’s racially motivated character as an “aggravating circumstance.”

The same month, former Prime Minister Alain Juppé, a candidate in the 2017 presidential election, visited Aubervilliers and urged Franco-Chinese associations to keep hope for the possibility of “harmony between communities.”

Bernard Cazeneuve, the minister of the interior, has promised to send police reinforcements to Aubervilliers, and Meriem Derkaoui, the mayor of Aubervilliers, pledged to expand video surveillance.

A few months before Mr. Zhang was killed, the Aubervilliers Police Department hired a part-time translator to assist with the filing of complaints on a biweekly basis in an effort to improve relations with residents of Chinese origin. Still, some, including the CGT Police Ile-de-France — the Paris region’s branch of the national police union — say more police officers cannot solve the problem.

“We need a police force that is closer to the local population, one that can anticipate problems in the community,” Axel Ronde, the group’s general secretary, said. “We’ve abandoned this kind of work over the years, so it’s not going to change overnight.”

A turban Mr. Khalsa was wearing as part of his Sikh religion was disturbed in the attack, during which the men forced his head down and cut up to 10 inches of his hair with a knife, prosecutors said.

“The savage cutting of Mr. Khalsa’s unshorn hair, a sacred article of his faith, constitutes a hate crime under the law,” the prosecutor’s office said in a news release.

Mr. Little, who was taken into custody at the scene, was charged with assault and released that night on bail. He is to appear in court on Nov. 21. A warrant for Mr. Leblanc, who left the scene, has been issued, officials said. The other occupants of the pickup were not charged.

It was not clear if Mr. Little had a lawyer, and neither man could be reached to comment on Friday.

On the night of Saturday, Sept. 10, between the hours of about 8 and 11, six women, each of them walking in Midtown Manhattan, were approached by a group of young men who sought to light them on fire. Although the attacks were mercifully unsuccessful — no one was injured — one woman, standing at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and East 54th Street had her skirt set aflame, while another, walking past a Valentino store, the police reported, felt something warm on her left arm, only to realize that her blouse was on fire. Six days later, a 14-year old boy was taken into custody, and charged with attempted assault and harassment. Given that everyone targeted for conflagration was female, the police have considered these hate crimes.

That four of the encounters occurred on a stretch of Fifth Avenue just outside Trump Tower may bear no actual relationship to our current political misfortunes, but their symbolic freight is hard to overlook. For whatever it has done and failed to do, the presidential candidacy of Donald J. Trump has revived a national discussion of misogyny, which, as a word, an idea and worldview had long ago fallen out of favor, lost to the 1970s and obscured instead by the cheerfully appointed goal posts of contemporary feminism.

If you are concerned about misogyny, you are worried less about how we can create a better world for women who want to share whole-grain breakfasts with their children and still make it to Teterboro on time for the flight to the board meeting in Sun Valley, and more about the cultural damage inflicted by collective male rage. You take to heart Margaret Atwood’s famous saying that men are worried that women will laugh at them while women are worried that men will kill them. You are a generalist, really, and you see that the problem goes beyond whatever hindrance men might pose to your making partner or getting the dishwasher emptied. One kind of feminism imagines men as an existential threat, another merely as an inconvenience.

The former, of course, is a dark and not consistently rational way to think. That is why many women — particularly educated, affluent women who live in cities where crime rates are at historical lows and the presence of physical danger and extreme prejudice seem distant — don’t easily imagine that they could be set on fire on their way to dinner.",nytimes.com,True

But you have to wonder whether the cap on Twitter’s growth is tied more to that most basic — and base — of human emotions: hatred.

It courses through Twitter at an alarming rate, turbocharged by this year’s political campaigns and the rise of anti-immigration movements that dabble in racist, sexist and anti-Semitic tropes across the globe. And this is to say nothing of its use by terrorist recruiters.

It’s a lamentable turn that Twitter says it is urgently working to address.

Soon after Twitter took its place in the tech-driven media revolution a decade ago, it proved to be a forceful amplifier of ideas and personalities, one that could be a political game changer. Its role in enabling the Arab Spring movements remains inspirational. It helped foster bottom-up movements like the Tea Party and Black Lives Matter here in the United States. And, of course, it helped make possible the outsider candidacy of Donald J. Trump, who continues to use it, er, aggressively.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The back-and-forth over his candidacy, and the news media’s coverage of it, have added a new cache of material to the uglier side of Twitter’s oeuvre.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

More often than not, the venom comes from pseudonymous accounts — the white hoods of our time.

Just take a gander at @Bridget62945958, who published a series of anti-Semitic posts against my colleague Binyamin Appelbaum. One message showed a series of lampshades. Its caption read: “This is your family when Trump wins. Get your Israeli passport ready.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Twitter suspended the account after Mr. Appelbaum brought it to the attention of Twitter’s co-founder and chief executive, Jack Dorsey, by way of his own Twitter feed. A new account sprang right up to continue the vitriol, prompting Jeffrey Goldberg, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, to write a post asking Mr. Dorsey, “How does it feel to watch Twitter turning into an anti-Semitic cesspool?”

Mr. Goldberg says he is torn about what Twitter should do, given that its cause — openness and free speech — is a reason he and so many other journalists are drawn to the service. “That’s the fundamental problem,” he told me. “At a certain point I’d rather take myself off the platform where the speech has become so offensive than advocate for the suppression of that speech.”

Twitter clearly wrestles with the same fundamental problem. It warns users they may not “threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender” and various other traits. Yet it often fumbles the enforcement. Charlie Warzel of BuzzFeed News unearthed a doozy last week.

After a user who identified herself as Kathleen posted a tweet criticizing the Trump campaign, a Twitter member going by Adorable Deplorable directed a message back at her featuring a photograph of a beheaded man — apparently an ISIS victim — and the words, “Your [sic] heading for a deep hole.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Twitter forced the photo’s removal after BuzzFeed’s inquiries, but it initially told Kathleen that the post did not violate its policies. This is apparently common. In a BuzzFeed survey of Twitter users, about 90 percent of those who said they had reported abuse said their complaints went unheeded.

So-called trolls are a problem for all social media — even Facebook, which keeps a tidier, more contained system. (To wit, the Facebook message a local New Jersey politician wrote to the Daily Beast writer Olivia Nuzzi after she posted something about Mr. Trump that he did not like: “Hope. You. Get. Raped. By. A. Syrian. Refugee.”)

But the openness of Twitter, and the sheer speed and volume of information that moves through it, present a particularly hard challenge that executives there say they are rushing to meet.

“Everyone on Twitter should feel safe expressing diverse opinions and beliefs,” the company said in a statement it sent me on Saturday. “But behavior that harasses, intimidates or uses fear to silence another person’s voice should have no place on our platform.”

In a letter to shareholders, Mr. Dorsey said the company was putting in place technology enabling it to more readily detect abusive accounts, make it easier for users to report them and even prevent them in the first place.

It’s all a bit tricky for a company founded with an absolutist ethos, once calling itself “the free speech wing of the free speech party.”

Some of its moves to curtail abuse have drawn accusations that it is applying a double standard aimed at conservatives. After Twitter placed the Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos on permanent suspension for his role in the Twitter campaign against Ms. Jones, he accused it of declaring “war on free speech,” specifically against “libertarians, conservatives and anyone who loves mischief.”

Another banned Twitter provocateur, Charles C. Johnson — whom my predecessor David Carr once called a “troll on steroids” — says he is planning a lawsuit to fight his suspension.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In an interview, Mr. Johnson said he respected Twitter’s right to ban patently offensive speech but argued that it needed to set a consistent, uniformly applied standard. Still, he said, “the problem of trolls” might be unsolvable.

“It might just be a human nature problem,” he said. “Maybe we don’t like each other that much — and that’s what Twitter has revealed.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

We didn’t need Twitter to reveal that. And in the previous two media revolutions — radio and television — the country managed to strike some sort of accommodation between the right to free speech and the greater civic good.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

That happened because there was an immediate national recognition that these media could have tremendous power to shape culture, politics and government for good and for ill.

As Herbert Hoover moved to establish basic standards for radio, he acknowledged that it had “great possibilities of future influence” but was also of “potential public concern.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

He declared radio should be developed with public interest in mind, an idea that carried over to television. What followed were standards that forced broadcasters to devote at least some of their hours to civic affairs while avoiding obscene and “grossly offensive” content. At times, the efforts have wandered dangerously into censorship. But at least there was a big national discussion about what should beam into American living rooms.

There was no similarly robust discussion at the start of this, the latest media revolution, and we can only hope that the political mistrust isn’t so great that we can’t have a constructive one now.

Each new media development has served as a mirror for the society that spawned it. It sure seems time for a good, hard look.

Providence, R.I. — Last semester, a group came to Providence to speak against admitting Syrian refugees to this country. As the president of the Brown Coalition for Syria, I jumped into action with my peers to stage a counterdemonstration. But I quickly found myself cut out of the planning for this event: Other student groups were not willing to work with me because of my leadership roles in campus Jewish organizations.

That was neither the first nor the last time that I would be ostracized this way. Also last semester, anti-Zionists at Brown circulated a petition against a lecture by the transgender rights advocate Janet Mock because one of the sponsors was the Jewish campus group Hillel, even though the event was entirely unrelated to Israel or Zionism. Ms. Mock, who planned to talk about racism and transphobia, ultimately canceled. Anti-Zionist students would rather have no one speak on these issues than allow a Jewish group to participate in that conversation.

Of course, I still believe in the importance of accepting refugees, combating discrimination, abolishing racist law enforcement practices and other causes. Nevertheless, it’s painful that Jewish issues are shut out of these movements. Jewish rights belong in any broad movement to fight oppression.

My fellow activists tend to dismiss the anti-Semitism that students like me experience regularly on campus. They don’t acknowledge the swastikas that I see carved into bathroom stalls, scrawled across walls or left on chalkboards. They don’t hear students accusing me of killing Jesus. They don’t notice professors glorifying anti-Semitic figures such as Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt or the leadership of Hezbollah, as mine have.",nytimes.com,True

Trump, who has called for a ban on immigration by Muslims and a national registry of Muslims in the United States.

“We’re seeing these stereotypes and derogative statements become part of the political discourse,” said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the San Bernardino campus. “The bottom line is we’re talking about a significant increase in these types of hate crimes.”

He said that the frequency of anti-Muslim violence appeared to have increased immediately after some of Mr. Trump’s most incendiary comments.

The latest major episode of anti-Muslim violence came last weekend, when an arsonist on a motorcycle started a fire that engulfed the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, Fla., where Omar Mateen — the gunman in the June massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando — had sometimes prayed.

The police, who called the attack “a terrible tragedy” for the community, arrested a local man who had criticized Islam in social media postings.

The arson, along with an earlier assault on a congregant outside the mosque and other episodes there, has left worshipers scared, said Mohammed Malik, 43, a businessman who has attended the mosque for nearly a decade.

“There is a lot of negative rhetoric,” he said. “The negative rhetoric is causing the hate, and in turn the hate is causing the violent acts.”

The new study from Mr. Levin’s nonpartisan group, based on official police reports in 20 states, estimated that there were about 260 hate crimes against Muslims nationwide in 2015.

That was the most since the record 481 documented hate crimes against Muslims in 2001, when the Sept. 11 attacks set off waves of crimes targeting Muslims and Middle Easterners, Mr. Levin said. The huge increase last year was also the biggest annual rise since 2001, he said.

The rise came even as hate crimes against almost all other groups — including blacks, Hispanics, Jews, gays and whites — either declined or increased only slightly, his study found. One exception was hate crimes against transgender people, which rose about 40 percent.

An advance copy of the study was provided to The New York Times.

The statistics almost certainly understate the extent of the problem, researchers say, because victims are often reluctant to report attacks for fear of inflaming community tensions, and because it is sometimes difficult for investigators to establish that religious, ethnic or racial hatred was a cause.

In the killing last year of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, N.C., for instance, the authorities did not bring hate crime charges against a neighbor who is charged with murdering them, despite calls from Muslims who said there were religious overtones to the violence.

Sometimes, the evidence is more clear-cut.

“I hate ISLAM!” a former Marine named Ted Hakey Jr. wrote to a friend on Facebook after last November’s terrorist attacks in Paris. Hours later, in a drunken rampage, he fired a high-powered rifle four times into the mosque next door to his Connecticut home.

In Brooklyn, two women out walking their children in strollers were attacked this month, the police said, by a woman who screamed anti-Muslim obscenities and tried to rip off their traditional veils. And in Queens, a man was beaten in April by three strangers who shouted “ISIS, ISIS.”

In a few cases, people accused of hate crimes against Muslims and others have even cited Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump’s supporters say that he has never endorsed violence against any minorities, and some conservatives have challenged data showing an increase in violence against American Muslims as a creation of liberal-leaning researchers.

Mr. Trump has said he is not responsible for any violence by his supporters.

The latest police figures show that nationally hate crimes rose by 32 percent in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the eight weeks after the referendum, compared with the same period a year earlier. The police attributed the increase partly to higher awareness of hate crimes.

Among those most affected are immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe, including substantial numbers who came to Britain under European Union rules that allow citizens of member nations to live and work in other member countries without a visa. In Leeds, in northern England, a 28-year-old Polish man was kicked and punched last week by a group of up to 20 teenagers wearing hoodies, the police in West Yorkshire said on Monday. The attack was being investigated as “racially aggravated due to comments made to the victim and his friend,” the police said in a statement, adding that the man required stitches for a head wound.

There has also been an increase in attacks and insults aimed at native Britons who have Asian or African ancestry or are Muslim. Last month in Milton Keynes, a town 45 miles north of London, a 34-year-old pregnant Muslim woman was kicked in the stomach by a man shouting racist remarks, the police said on Tuesday. “This racially aggravated assault had absolutely devastating consequences for the victim, who lost her baby as a result of the attack,” said Richard Armitage, the investigating officer for the Milton Keynes police.

Harlow is characterized by seemingly endless roundabouts and tired-looking low-rise buildings. Mr. Jozwik’s death on Aug. 29 has divided residents here. Some see it as an obvious hate crime, while others regard the episode as merely a symptom of the town’s persistent youth crime. Nearly 1,000 criminal offenses, most of them nonviolent, were recorded in Harlow in June alone.

Part of the debate here surrounds the legal definition of hate crimes, which some consider too subjective. According to the police, a victim’s perception is what counts, even if the motivation behind a hostile act is unclear. A slur based on race, religion, sexual orientation, gender or disability that emerged in the heat of an argument, for example, can be recorded as a hate incident if that was how someone perceived it. But, to some people, such insults are relatively normal exchanges during a fight.

Mark Hamilton, an assistant chief constable who leads hate crime policy for the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said in an interview that if a court decides Mr. Jozwik’s killing was a hate crime, it will be the most serious attack since the referendum.

Mr. Jozwik and a friend were assaulted just before midnight on Aug. 27 outside a pizza place at the Stow, a small, run-down shopping mall in Harlow. The police, citing security camera footage, said that after the men ordered from TGF Pizza, they went outside and spoke with a group of young people for 20 minutes.

Then the mood changed. A quarrel began and Mr. Jozwik received a single punch in the face, causing him to fall backward and bang his head on the ground. The suspects fled.

Mr. Jozwik died two days later from a head injury before he was able to testify, a police official said. His friend and another man were also injured. Six people, ages 15 and 16, were arrested and released on bail. They will appear in court next month.

“I don’t think it was inspired by racial hatred,” he said. “But everyone wants to jump on that bandwagon.”

“Of course it was a hate crime,” she said, nervously puffing a cigarette outside an Eastern European supermarket in the town’s center. She was fearful and requested that her last name not be published. She said that the group started chanting a derogatory term in Polish at the two men, and that when one of them approached the group a fight broke out.

The police said they were treating the assault as a possible hate crime.

Whatever the motives, the attacks have only heightened suspicion between Britons and immigrants, with some recent arrivals saying the attacks have prompted them to consider moving because they fear for their safety. Some Britons in Harlow say they fear a possible backlash from the immigrants.

But last year, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the bias-intimidation law was unconstitutional.

The court threw out those charges and concluded that the evidence that prosecutors presented to prove them had “tainted the jury’s verdict on the remaining charges” and deprived Mr. Ravi of a fair trial.

Lawrence S. Lustberg, a lawyer who argued that the bias-intimidation law was unconstitutional, said that the appeals court had little choice but to decide that the convictions reached using that statute were wrong. Having done that, it was “pretty straightforward” to conclude “that the whole trial was deeply infected by that error,” Mr. Lustberg said.

The Middlesex County prosecutor’s office will now have to decide whether to appeal or to try Mr. Ravi again on the other 10 charges.

After apologizing for his actions, Mr. Ravi served 20 days in jail on some of the charges and was ordered to pay $10,000 to a program to help victims of hate crimes. But Mr. Clementi’s parents, Joe and Jane, rejected the “so-called apology” as a “public-relations piece.” They also criticized the judge, Glenn Bermen of State Superior Court, for not sentencing Mr. Ravi to jail for bias crimes, saying he missed a chance to highlight their seriousness.

Joe and Jane Clementi responded to the ruling with a statement released through the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which they founded to help end bullying.

“In light of today’s decision, we will do what we encourage all people to do before they push that send button, and that is to pause and consider the implications of their message,” the statement said. “Does it encourage and build someone up or does it destroy and harm another person? Our world moves very fast which pushes us to be impulsively spontaneous and sometimes harsh.”

Reached by phone on Friday evening, Ms. Clementi said the prosecutors told her that they would notify her family next week about how they would proceed. She said she did not have an opinion on whether the litigation should continue.

“Social media is a great tool, but it can be used for good and it can be used for harm and destruction,” Ms. Clementi said. “This just fosters my desire to keep moving and make sure that other people hear this and know this.”

The appeals court judges did not minimize their disapproval of what Mr. Ravi had done.

“The social environment that transformed a private act of sexual intimacy into a grotesque voyeuristic spectacle must be unequivocally condemned in the strongest possible way,” the opinion said. “The fact that this occurred in a university dormitory, housing first-year college students, only exacerbates our collective sense of disbelief and disorientation,” it continued. “All of the young men and women who had any association with this tragedy must pause to reflect and assess whether this experience has cast an indelible moral shadow on their character.”",nytimes.com,True

A Florida man who posted a Facebook rant threatening to kill gay people on Labor Day in a style he compared to the massacre at an Orlando nightclub and the killing of African-Americans by police officers has been arrested and charged with a federal crime, the F.B.I. said in a statement.

According to a criminal complaint released on Sunday by the F.B.I., Craig Allen Jungwirth, 50, a party promoter in Wilton Manors, Fla., wrote in a Facebook post early last week that his events were “selling out” because gay people were “total patsies.”

“None of you deserve to live,” he wrote, according to the complaint. “If you losers thought the Pulse nightclub shooting was bad, wait till you see what I’m planning for Labor Day.”

In other posts, using homophobic and racist slurs, he wrote that he had a “solution to exterminate you losers,” the complaint said.

Efforts on Sunday to contact Mr. Jungwirth or his lawyer for comment were unsuccessful.

Mr. Jungwirth was arrested on Saturday by the Florida Highway Patrol in Osceola County, south of Orlando, on a charge of driving with a suspended license, an unrelated episode, according to Michael D. Leverock, a spokesman for the F.B.I. in Miami.

It renewed alarm among Eastern European immigrants that the campaign leading to Britain’s decision in a June 23 referendum to leave the European Union, known as “Brexit,” has unleashed a wave of xenophobia.

Before the vote, members of the far-right who supported leaving the bloc played adroitly on concerns about unchecked immigration, warning that the union’s open borders threatened the British way of life, made the country vulnerable to terrorism and hurt workers. One poster, released during the campaign by the far-right U.K. Independence Party, showed a seemingly endless line of migrants and the words “Breaking Point.”

The killing has shaken the close-knit multicultural community in Harlow, which has a large Polish population. Dozens of residents participated in a candlelit vigil; some held signs saying “migrants and refugees welcome here.” Others laid flowers in a makeshift memorial on the street where the attack took place. One note read, “Not everyone in Harlow is as evil as those people.”

Poles constitute the largest number of foreign-born residents of Britain, with 831,000 of them in the country, and the assault in Harlow added to a string of attacks against them. In June, shortly after the referendum, the Polish Social and Cultural Association in the Hammersmith district of London, home to a large Polish community, was vandalized.

“My mum came back from holiday and did not know what had happened,” Radoslaw Jozwik told reporters. “We had to meet her at Stansted Airport and tell her, and then take her straight to the hospital. She is really struggling.”

He said his brother, who came to Britain four years ago to work, had been targeted because he was Polish. “The police have told us he was attacked because they heard him and his friends speaking the Polish language,” he said. “He was standing, eating pizza, and they picked on him because of that. He does not speak much English.”

He added, “After the Brexit vote it has got worse — I have seen people change — it is hard at the moment.”

Arkady Rzegocki, Poland’s recently appointed ambassador to Britain, said in an interview that he feared the decision to leave the European Union had given license to xenophobia, and that more minorities were being targeted. He visited the crime scene in Harlow on Wednesday and met with Mr. Jozwik’s family. He plans to participate in a “march of silence” organized by the Polish community on Saturday.

According to the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the number of reported hate crimes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland has jumped 46 percent, to 1,831 in the week after the June 23 referendum from the comparable week a year earlier. More recently, in the period from July 22 to 28, reports of hate crimes had jumped 34 percent from a year earlier. The police cautioned, however, that the rise could be attributed in part to higher awareness of hate crimes.

Ms. Goldberg’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment on the project.

Film history is filled with multiple titles on a single subject, and Ms. Ebert said she did not feel there was a rivalry among the Till projects: “The history of this nation and of the civil rights movement is much too important to be claimed exclusively by any one person or project.”

Her biopic is based on “Death of Innocence: The Story of the Hate Crime That Changed America,” by Till’s mother and Christopher Benson, a University of Illinois professor who teaches African-American studies and journalism. Mr. Benson said the biopic would be informed by his close working relationship with Mrs. Mobley, who died in 2003. She “had a concern about the way his story would be treated in Hollywood,” he said, adding that with her “authentic voice,” the film would seek a “deeper understanding of race relations in America.”

HBO executives declined to discuss their project’s status, saying that it was in “active development” and would be “an immersive and in-depth exploration of the Emmett Till story.” It’s based on what is widely deemed the most comprehensive book on the subject, “Emmett Till: The Murder That Shocked the World and Propelled the Civil Rights Movement,” by Devery Anderson.

Mr. Beauchamp’s 2003 documentary, “The Untold Story of Emmett Till,” drew criticism for its speculation on the number of possible co-conspirators in the killing. (Mr. Beauchamp said he would not be a character in the feature film.)

Filming of his script for “Till” is scheduled to begin next year in Mississippi, though Mr. Beauchamp declined to give details of the movie’s financing. Among the producers is Fred Zollo, whose credits include the civil rights dramas “Mississippi Burning” (1988) and “Ghosts of Mississippi” (1996).

In addition to Mr. Wright’s book, the foundation of “Till” will be Mr. Beauchamp’s own research into the case, including previously unreleased F.B.I. files.

“I have stuff that’s not in Devery’s book,” Mr. Beauchamp said, adding that he respected the other filmmakers, but that it was “ a battle” to be the first to release a work.

For Mr. Wright, the film is a chance to remember his cousin and remind viewers of the monumental injustice done. Till’s killers, Roy Bryant, husband of the white woman at the center of the case, and his half brother J. W. Milam, were acquitted by an all-white jury that deliberated for little more than an hour. The pair later confessed to the crime in an interview with Look magazine. “The main thing I don’t want to lose in the film is the verdict,” Mr. Wright said. “Besides Emmett’s death, that’s what really enraged us.”",nytimes.com,True

Ms. Barnette described herself as White Lives Matter’s co-founder in her profile on Vk.com, a Russian social networking site preferred by white nationalists for its lenient approach to posts that contain racist content.

Mark Pitcavage, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League, agreed that the phrase had spread beyond the group.

“White Lives Matter is a concept around which you can organize an event without necessarily being a formal organization,” he said. “It is essentially the sum of the number of people who have done actions in the name of White Lives Matter.”

“For white supremacists, ‘White Lives Matter’ is an obvious meme, so they will use it,” he said.

On Vk.com, Ms. Barnette defended the group, writing that its members were unfairly labeled ""domestic terrorists.” In other posts she argued that white women represent “the elite of the human species.” She also shared Nazi memes and frequently used racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic slurs.

The attack, which took place in broad daylight on Saturday, just blocks from the men’s mosque in the Ozone Park neighborhood, set off a wave of fear throughout the community of Bangladeshi immigrants, who have moved in recent years to the neighborhoods along the Brooklyn-Queens border.

Since the attack, many in that community noted that the men were dressed in religious garb and that Mr. Akonjee was found with more than $1,000 in cash, which was viewed by some as an indication that the men had been targeted not for a robbery, but because they were Muslim.

Police Commissioner William J. Bratton acknowledged the calls to classify the attack as a hate crime, saying it has not been ruled out but ultimately depended on the gunman’s motivation.

Chief Boyce said investigators had talked to his relatives and friends, who told them they knew of no troubling signs or history of animosity between him and Muslim or Bangladeshi people. No previous connection between Mr. Morel and the victims has emerged, he said.

Many in the Bangladeshi community who live in the area around Ozone Park have argued that the attack on Saturday was a hate crime, noting that the men were dressed in religious garb. Officials said prosecuting the case as a hate crime remained possible.

“While the motivation for this violent act is still unclear and continues to be investigated, one of the possible motives being explored is whether this was a hate crime,” Mr. Brown said. Regardless of whether a hate crime had been committed, he added, “the crime will be vigorously prosecuted, and we will seek the most serious penalties that our law allows.”

I don’t believe he could do it.”

The authorities said that Mr. Morel had walked up behind Mr. Akonjee and Mr. Miah near the intersection of Liberty Avenue and 79th Street, shot them and then drove off in a Chevrolet sport utility vehicle.

An imam and his assistant were gunned down on a street in Ozone Park, Queens, on Saturday, minutes after finishing afternoon prayers, two blocks from their mosque. A man got out of car, ran up behind them, shot each in the head, and fled.

The killer said nothing to his victims and did not rob them. In the hours after the crime, the New York Police Department said it had no suspect or known motive for the ambush, leaving open all possibilities — an argument, grudge or other conflict, or some other random reason.

The possibilities include hate, for which the police said they had no evidence, but which Muslims across the city, including the many in the neighborhood with roots in Bangladesh, could not ignore. The imam, Maulama Akonjee, and his assistant, Thara Uddin, wore the beards and traditional garb of devout Muslims. They visibly proclaimed membership in a group that has been vilified, in the United States and around the world, and particularly in the current presidential campaign, by those who believe that terrorist violence implicates an entire religion.

Testimony underscored that despite Canada’s national pride over inclusiveness, a racial line often separates indigenous Canadians from the rest of society.

“There’s racism here,” said Sara Brady, an Ojibway teacher who runs a team of workers who assist indigenous students at a high school in Thunder Bay. “You have kids who have never experienced racism before, and that’s a big thing for some of them. They don’t understand what that is until they get here.”

Among the statistics offered at the inquest, a calculation by Dr. David Eden, the presiding coroner, stood out. Two of the students, Kyle Morrisseau and Robyn Harper, came from Keewaywin, population around 300, about 350 miles northwest of Thunder Bay. For Thunder Bay to suffer a proportionally similar tragedy, he said, 700 high school students would need to die.

Kyle Morrisseau’s death offers a glimpse into his failed jump from one world into another, and its devastating effect on his family.

He was a celebrity in Keewaywin, which consists of little more than an airstrip, nursing station, school, general store and post office. He was the third generation of his family to find success in selling art. He and his father, Christian Morriseau (some family members use a single “S” in the surname), painted aboriginal mythology images sold in galleries in Ottawa and elsewhere. His grandfather Norval Morrisseau was one of Canada’s best-known aboriginal painters.

Since Kyle’s death, Christian Morriseau’s marriage has dissolved and his house has burned down. He now lives part time in another house, condemned and filled with mold, in between annual trips to paint in Toronto.

When his son started attending high school in Thunder Bay, Mr. Morriseau said in an interview, he had little concern. Two cousins worked at the high school, and an uncle coordinated programs for indigenous students in the city.

“We had family there,” he said.

Mr. Morriseau planned trips to Toronto and Ottawa to meet with art collectors so that he could change planes in Thunder Bay and spend time with Kyle.

One night in October 2009, while they shared a hotel room, Kyle told his father that he wanted to return to Keewaywin, only to abruptly reverse himself the next day, promising to “tough it out,” Mr. Morriseau said. Kyle was found dead less than a month later.

Mr. Morriseau said he has agonized over Kyle’s change of mind ever since. “He was just lonely, I guess,” he said.

He said the evidence at the inquest showed that there were bruises on Kyle’s body, suggesting that his son may have been attacked. The jury also heard how at least one other indigenous student had been assaulted by young white men and thrown into the river. That student, fearing for his life, left Thunder Bay and returned home.

Regardless, Mr. Morriseau said he was convinced that Kyle had not committed suicide. While many Canadian aboriginal communities have exceptionally high rates of suicide and attempted suicide, statistics presented at the inquest showed that hanging is overwhelmingly the most common method. Drowning is not even a category.

The inquest jury listed the means of Kyle’s death as “undetermined.”

Asked what he thought had happened, Mr. Morriseau, 46, looked down, replying: “Who knows, man. Only he does — him and the creator knows what happened.”

“Somebody else does know something out there,” he continued, “but I don’t think it will ever come up, or maybe it’s too late to come up.”

Educating indigenous Canadians has long been considered one of the country’s most troubling issues. For much of Canada’s early history, native children were forcibly removed from their families and sent to residential schools largely run by churches. Physical, mental and sexual abuse were widespread. The program was less about education, a national Truth and Reconciliation Commission found last year, than it was about “cultural genocide.”

Today, schooling for most Canadians is financed with a mix of provincial and local taxes, and the federal government is responsible for educating only indigenous children who live on reserves.

The result is a stark disparity. The inquest found that Thunder Bay’s Roman Catholic French-language school board has a budget of roughly 27,000 Canadian dollars, or about $20,000, per student. Dennis Franklin Cromarty High School, where six of the dead students were enrolled, gets 11,000 Canadian dollars per pupil. Not every high school student on a reserve in northwestern Ontario attends Cromarty, or D.F.C., as it is commonly known. Many attend the Pelican Falls First Nations High School, a boarding school nearer to the reserves.

But Jonathan Kakegamic, the principal at D.F.C., said that he believes its location provides greater learning opportunities and makes it easier to attract and retain good teachers.

The school partly compensates for the budget disparity with fund-raising that helps pay for extra teachers, student meals and after-school sports.

But as he used a stationary bicycle late one afternoon in the school’s weight room, Mr. Kakegamic said that what the school really needed was a dormitory.

“When you have 150 kids staying in private citizens’ boarding homes throughout the city, that’s a difficult thing to maintain,” he said. “There’s so many injustices at every level.”

Mr. Kakegamic’s home community is Keewaywin. He taught elementary school there, and is a cousin of Kyle Morrisseau’s family. As he recalled the school’s searches for each of its students who were ultimately found dead, tears mixed with the sweat on his face.

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/world/americas/brazil-anti-gay-violence.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"While Americans have fiercely debated how to respond to the massacre last month at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., Brazilians have been confronting their own epidemic of anti-gay violence — one that, by some counts, has earned Brazil the ignominious ranking of the world’s deadliest place for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.

Nearly 1,600 people have died in hate-motivated attacks in the past four and half years, according to Grupo Gay da Bahia, which tracks the deaths through news articles. By its tally, a gay or transgender person is killed almost every day in this nation of 200 million.

“And these numbers represent only the tip of the iceberg of violence and bloodshed,” said Eduardo Michels, the group’s data manager, adding that the Brazilian police often omit anti-gay animus when compiling homicide reports.

Such statistics can be hard to square with Brazil’s storied image as a tolerant, open society — a nation that seemingly nurtures freewheeling expressions of sexuality during Carnival and holds the world’s biggest gay pride parade in the city of São Paulo.

Here in Rio de Janeiro, host to the coming Summer Olympics, fear of violent crime is on many people’s minds. Amid a crushing recession and soaring unemployment, street crime is up 24 percent this year and homicides have increased by more than 15 percent.

At the same time, human rights activists say members of the Rio police force, eager to clean up the city ahead of the Aug. 5 opening ceremony for the Games, have shot dead more than 100 people this year, most of them young black men living in poor neighborhoods.

But advocates say the constant homophobic violence also threatens to upend an idealized national ethos that promises equality and respect for all Brazilians.

“We live off this image as an open and tolerant place,” said Jandira Queiroz, the mobilization coordinator at Amnesty International Brazil. “Homophobic violence has hit crisis levels, and it’s getting worse.”

Brazil’s near-mythic reputation for tolerance is not without justification. In the nearly three decades since democracy replaced military dictatorship, the Brazilian government has introduced numerous laws and policies aimed at improving the lives of sexual minorities. In 1996, it was among the first to offer free antiretroviral drugs to people with H.I.V. In 2003, Brazil became the first country in Latin America to recognize same-sex unions for immigration purposes, and it was among the earliest to allow gay couples to adopt children.

In 2013, the Brazilian judiciary effectively legalized same-sex marriage.

Some experts suggest that liberal government policies may have gotten too far ahead of traditional social mores. The anti-gay violence, they contend, can be traced to Brazil’s culture of machismo and a brand of evangelical Christianity, exported from the United States, that is outspoken in its opposition to homosexuality.

Evangelicals make up nearly a quarter of Brazil’s population, up from 5 percent in 1970, and religious leaders reach millions of people through the hundreds of television and radio stations they have purchased in recent years.

American-style Pentecostal congregations are also playing an increasingly muscular role in Brazilian politics. Evangelical voters have helped send more than 60 lawmakers to the 513-member lower house of Congress, doubling their numbers since 2010 and making them one of the most disciplined blocs in an unruly and divided legislature.

Jean Wyllys, Brazil’s only openly gay member of Congress, said evangelical lawmakers, the core of a coalition known as the “B.B.B. caucus” — short for Bullets, Beef and Bible — have stymied legislation that would punish anti-gay discrimination and increase penalties for hate crimes.

“Evangelicals are getting increasingly powerful and have taken over Congress,” Mr. Wyllys said.

Eduardo Cunha, an evangelical Christian radio commentator who served as president of the lower house, once suggested that Congress establish a Heterosexual Pride Day. After a Brazilian soap opera featured a gay kiss, he broadcast his revulsion on Twitter. (Mr. Cunha, who faces allegations that he took $40 million in bribes, was ordered to step down in May.)

During a televised presidential debate in 2014, one of the candidates, Levy Fidelix, said that homosexuals were unfit to be parents and that “excretory systems aren’t for reproduction.” Jair Bolsonaro, a congressman well known for his conservative views, has recommended corporal punishment as a tool for turning gays into heterosexuals.

Javier Corrales, a political scientist at Amherst College who studies gay rights movements in Latin America, said much of the homophobia was a reaction to achievements like same-sex marriage.

“Brazilians are becoming more tolerant,” he said, “but the countertrend is that those who remain intolerant and opposed to L.G.B.T. rights are developing new strategies and a more virulent discourse to block progress on those issues.”

Marco Feliciano, a prominent member of the evangelical bloc in Congress, rejects suggestions that anti-gay sentiment fosters violence. In an interview, he expressed regret for an earlier remark describing AIDS as “a gay cancer,” but defended efforts to fight gay rights legislation, insisting, for example, that same-sex couples are unfit to be parents.

“They put civilization and traditional families at risk of destruction,” he said.

Conservative politicians have resisted efforts to teach tolerance in schools, and the police have shown little interest in adopting training programs to help rank-and-file officers tackle bias crimes. Victims of anti-gay and transgender violence say they often experience a fresh round of humiliation from the law enforcement authorities, some of whom are openly hostile to requests that they record a crime as bias-motivated.

Dudu Quintanilha, 28, an artist and photographer from São Paulo, said he had been beaten with a stick by four assailants during Carnival this year. The attackers, who set upon him in the heart of downtown, shouted anti-gay epithets as they bloodied his face, he said, but the police refused to consider the attack an act of homophobia.

Over several hours, he said, officers at a police station insisted that he had been the victim of a simple robbery because he lost his cellphone and wallet during the chaos. “In the end, they made me doubt whether a homophobic attack really happened,” he said. “They made me doubt if I was in my right mind.”

Antonio Kvalo, 34, a web designer, created temlocal.com.br, a site where Brazilians can log instances of anti-gay violence. He said he had been motivated in part by his own experience, in 2008, when two men tackled him on a street in Rio and kicked him dozens of times.

When the police arrived, they repeatedly questioned his account and, after he insisted that they record the attack as a hate crime, told him to drape himself over the trunk of their vehicle and assume the pose of a suspect. “They made me feel like I was a criminal,” he said.

Activists say transgender Brazilians face the greatest brutality, with many murder victims badly mutilated. Last year, a group of men videotaped their assault on Piu da Silva, 25, an ebullient samba dancer in Rio, who was tortured and forced to beg for her life before being stabbed and shot six times. The assailants, who posted the attack on Facebook, were not found.

“Transsexuals live with constant fear,” Mr. Kvalo said.

Even when suspects in homophobic violence are arrested, advocates say, they are often treated leniently. The two men who savagely beat André Baliera, a 28-year-old law student, in an upscale neighborhood of São Paulo were originally charged with attempted murder. Last year, after serving a two-month sentence, the men were ordered to pay a $6,300 fine and released.

The fear is palpable for Gilson Borges Reis, 18, a student in Lauro de Freitas, an industrial city in northeast Brazil. Last month, a cousin who had long taunted him for being gay chased him down the street with a kitchen knife, stabbing him in the chest and arms as relatives watched in horror.

Mr. Reis survived, and the cousin, an evangelical Christian, was arrested. He has been charged with attempted murder, but was promptly released on bail.

Amid prayers, songs and eulogies, hundreds of relatives and friends made their way to the front to pay respects to the two men, who were among the 49 killed in a massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla.

After the two men were memorialized side by side, Mr. Wilson-León’s body was flown back to Puerto Rico for burial while Mr. Perez, 35, was buried near his family in Florida. The story of Mr. Wilson-León’s journey to Florida is indicative of the larger spectrum of challenges faced by the gay community in rural areas of Puerto Rico.

In 2004, when Mr. Wilson-León, 37, left Puerto Rico, his friends said he was seeking acceptance. “Dani was looking for Dani. He was looking for himself,” said Laly Santiago-León, his cousin. “He wanted to be who he truly was, without any barriers, without any judgment.”

In Florida, he found support at the home of the aunt who had persuaded him to come out as gay. “To me everyone is the same,” the aunt, Noelia León de Santiago, said. “I wanted him with me so he could be happy and he could be in his own world.”

In six months, Dani learned to speak English. Eventually, he gained complete independence and built a life with Mr. Perez, his partner of 10 years.

At Mr. Wilson-León’s funeral, relatives who had once been unwilling to shake his hand because he was gay, were there to mourn his death.

More than 40 people have been killed in Bangladesh in a series of attacks that began in early 2013. The attacks initially targeted bloggers but then expanded to include foreigners, gay activists and members of religious minorities. In an effort to forestall further violence, the government announced a crackdown in early June and has arrested more than 11,000 people, 194 of them said to be linked to militant networks.

Kajal Debnath, a presidium member of the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, said that Hindus, particularly in rural villages, are terrified and call his organization daily wondering if they will survive the latest outbreak of killings. They have been victims of oppression in Bangladesh for decades and do not know why they have suddenly become the “prime target of a series of similar killings,” he said.

Sayeeda Warsi, a leading member of the House of Lords and a former chairwoman of the Conservative Party who switched to the “Remain” camp during the campaign, had accused leaders of the Leave campaign of peddling xenophobia and racism. She compiled a collage of Twitter messages to show her alarm.

A rally by a white nationalist group at California’s State Capitol in Sacramento became violent on Sunday when protesters clashed with the group, leaving at least 10 people hurt, two of them critically, fire officials said.

Videos posted on Twitter showed members of the nationalist group, the Traditionalist Worker Party, which had obtained a permit to demonstrate, brawling on the Capitol grounds with protesters who were dressed in black and concealed by face coverings.

It was unclear whether the protesters were affiliated with any organization. Chris Harvey, a Fire Department spokesman, described them as “left-wing, anarchist types.”

“It was a very chaotic situation,” he said. “All we could do was just grab, load and go.”

The two critically injured people were expected to survive, fire officials told The Associated Press. At least eight others were reported to have suffered various cuts, bruises and stab wounds.",nytimes.com,True

These are people who understand that if you’re gay or transgender, you can’t simply hope that laws will protect you. They won’t. And you can’t rely on the police. Orlando is proof you could bleed to death in the time it takes for them to stop the shooter.

What happened in Orlando was not just an attack on America, it was an attack on L.G.B.T. people. While America at large debates what laws could have prevented this, what role Islam plays, and which political party is to blame, we need to get practical: If you don’t defend yourself, no one else will.

Most would agree — as do I — that violence is rarely the answer, and it’s never a first line of defense. But when my friends tell me they’d rather die than resort to violence, I tell them fine, I’ll light a candle at your vigil. It’s your choice. But those are the stakes. Don’t kid yourself otherwise.

I used to have reservations about people carrying guns in bars. But 12 states allow concealed carry in bars, and I haven’t heard any reports of increased violence in those places. Now I can’t help wondering how many victims in Orlando might have been saved if a few people inside the nightclub had had concealed carry permits, and been able to fight back.

Many L.G.B.T. people view guns as evil — immoral killing machines that should be heavily regulated, if not eradicated. That’s because they hear about guns only when the story ends tragically, or when they see them used in violent movies.

But every day, Americans use guns to defend themselves, and they don’t even have to pull the trigger. The mere appearance of a firearm can save their life. Just last week, Tom G. Palmer, now a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, wrote in an op-ed article in The New York Daily News about an episode in his 20s when he flashed his pistol at a group of men who were threatening to kill him because he was gay — and they retreated.

This is a call to L.G.B.T. people to take their own defense seriously, and to question the left-leaning institutions that tell them guns are bad, and should be left to the professionals. Become a professional. You’re allowed. That’s what the Second Amendment is for. We can fight back when our lives depend on it.",nytimes.com,True

ORLANDO, Fla. — It seemed as if all of Orlando was here, crowded around a glittering lake to remember the 49 people who died in a fit of violence.

Among the people, estimated by the police at 50,000, present at a vigil on Sunday for the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting were:

Minnie Perez, 47, a Pulse regular who said she had lost 14 friends. She wore a blanket bearing their faces.

Megan Elkins, 25, who held her 7-year-old nephew as if it was the last time she would have the chance to do so.

And Syed, Ivette and Sasha Shamsuzzaman, a Bangladeshi-Puerto Rican family sitting under a black umbrella at the edge of the lake. Mr. Shamsuzzaman, 61, a Muslim from Bangladesh, wore a peace sign around his neck and called for Pulse to reopen as quickly as possibly.

ORLANDO, Fla. — They came for the flashing neon lights, hip-swiveling tunes, cocktails and glitzy drag queens. Some arrived with a sense of purpose and defiance, to show that everything is going to be all right, to remember the loved ones they lost. Others just wanted to move on.

This city of fun and fantasy is gingerly plodding back into its night life scene this weekend, the first since 49 people were killed on Latin night at Pulse a week ago. The mass shooting rocked the gay and Latino communities here, and has left the entire city grappling with the odd emotion of doing the exact thing that the victims were doing before the carnage began in the early hours of last Sunday.

But they did not come in their usual numbers, and many of those who did turned out with a newfound wariness. Where are the emergency exits? Who is that coming through the door? What is in that backpack?

“Eerie,” Jonathan Arroyo said Friday night as neon lights bounced off his face next to the white banquettes at Southern Nights, a popular gay club.

Mr. Arroyo unfolded a receipt from his jean shorts: a $26.75 tab from Pulse, timestamped only about 30 minutes before the shooting began about 2 a.m. It reminds him to appreciate life, and on his first time at a club since the shooting, he took in the light, playful atmosphere — people drinking, dancing, having fun.

“How it felt that night,” he said, clutching a plastic cup of Hennessy, “I’m not going to let something like that mess up my routine.”

The truth, however, is that nothing is back to normal for the emotionally worn population here. Mr. Arroyo, 29, and several others said they had taken note of the exit signs in the bars and clubs for the first time. They had discussed emergency plans with friends.

A patron at the Stonewall, a gay bar here, related an incident he had witnessed earlier in the evening at another night spot, Savoy. When a man wearing a backpack entered Savoy, three patrons at the bar quickly took notice. The owner darted after the newcomer, with a police officer bolting across the room, too. It took only a second to determine that he was just a guy with a knapsack.

But this is the reality now. The music played and the drinks were served, but people wondered whether things would ever be the same again.

“It was just a moment,” said Ray Christianna, 57, one of the patrons at the practically empty upstairs bar at Stonewall. “It was that kind of moment.”

His friend David Kinnamon, 51, added: “Every time the door opened, you thought, ‘Who’s coming in?’ This is going to take a while.”

The Orlando Police Department would not say whether it was taking extra precautions for the weekend, but security definitely appeared beefed up at late-night spots.

Private security guards in front of Southern Nights frisked patrons with all the invasiveness of a root canal. They rummaged through receipts and cash tucked into wallets, opened sunglasses cases, and patted down armpits, backs and ankles. A police squad car sat parked next to a late-night hot-dog stand.

Uniformed officers were stationed in front of the Parliament House, a gay hotel and bar. Security personnel at the door said that undercover officers were among the crowd.

Inside, the D.J., Daniel Borrero, spun tribal progressive house music. Next to a pool in the courtyard, a crush of people hooted at drag queens performing under spotlights in a benefit for the victims of the Pulse shooting.

“There are people talking about going back into the closet,” said Kenya Nott, 25, one of the Parliament House revelers. “But this is the time when we should explode out of it.”

In a few downtown blocks tightly packed with nightspots, music vibrated onto the streets and people flowed through by the dozens. But the scene was much tamer than normal.

“Literally half,” Mickey Gannett, manager of the Independent Bar, said, scoping out North Orange Avenue. His sales were down 50 percent. “We were open last night, and there were people sitting at the bar crying. I think it will be one or two more months before things are back to normal.”

One80 Skytop, a rooftop club and lounge, drew about a quarter of its normal crowd for Latin night on Friday. With the glimmer of the downtown skyline peering from just over One80’s parapet, Stephanie Giraldo, 21, sat on a wicker couch mugging for selfies in a black dress and red lipstick. Her friends danced around her. Though not closely connected to any of the shooting victims, she said the massacre pained her. But she said she did not want to let fear control her city.

“Rumor has been going around — stay away from the clubs, stay away from the theme parks,” she said. “What am I going to do? Stay home and reminisce about what happened?”

For those who are gay or deeply embedded in the community, their presence on the town on Friday night seemed to have more of a political and prideful resonance.

“My kids didn’t want me to come, but I had to,” Yesenia Rivera, 34, a former Pulse hostess, said at Southern Nights. “This is my family.”

There was, however, real ambivalence.

“We have to go to funerals tomorrow,” Leo Dominique, 34, said at the Savoy, where people passed out rainbow ribbons and showed off fresh tattoos dedicated to Pulse.

It is a place of therapy, really. Here, regulars gather several nights a week to hash out the details of breakups, celebrate job promotions and pick up potential dates. They tried to do the same on Friday night.

“I’m afraid to go anywhere else, but I’m never afraid to come here and see my friends,” said Darius Jones, 26. “It’s not more safe here than anywhere else, but it feels like it is. And — this is very morbid — but if I’m going to get shot, I’d rather be here with my friends at a place that I can call home.”",nytimes.com,True

ORLANDO, Fla. — Hundreds of partyers were bringing their best to the dance floor as the reggaeton beats emanated from the D.J. booth to the main floor at Pulse, where the revelers swayed to the music, which has roots in Jamaican dance hall, Trinidadian soca and Panamanian Spanish reggae.



Around 2 a.m., with closing time approaching, D.J.s Simon2001 and Infinite — working the main floor and the patio — were looking to bring the crowd down from the heights reached earlier in the evening.

A third D.J. — Flawless, whose real name is Kraig Matthews — was working in a different room at the club that night. He did not want to be interviewed for this article because of the trauma he endured, he said.

Some people were smoking cigarettes on the patio. Others were saying goodbye as they prepared to leave, hugging and sipping the last remnants of their cocktails.

“Everything was normal,” Infinite, whose real name is Ray Rivera, said in an interview Friday. “It was a normal night. People were getting their last drinks because last call was at 2:25. Everyone was chilling.”

By 2:05, all of that had changed.

In the early hours last Sunday, as a gunman stormed through the door of the popular gay nightclub in a city considered the “Theme Park Capital of the World,” the disc jockeys’ lives were flipped upside down.

As Mr. Rivera played traditional reggae tunes on the patio, Simon2001, whose real name is Simeon Alberto Roman Barria, was in another booth in the main dance room.

When the gunman, later identified as Omar Mateen, began his shooting spree, each D.J. cut the volume, trying to figure out what was going on. Mr. Rivera said he was only four feet from the club’s main exit on the patio, but he helped people get out before he fled.

Mr. Roman’s experience was different: He found himself cornered.

His D.J. booth was eight to 10 feet above the dance floor and only accessible by a ladder in a small room visible behind the bar. Behind the booth, in a loftlike area, was the manager’s office and a room used for storage.

“As soon as I heard the gunshots, I lowered the volume and ducked down,” Mr. Roman said during an interview at Mr. Rivera’s home.

After that, he said: “I crawled to hide behind an amplifier in the other room. I was there the entire three hours.”

Mr. Roman said he encountered the club’s lighting technician in the loft area; as they sought a haven, they were joined by a third man, who had been shot in the arm but managed to scramble up the ladder to relative safety.

Mr. Roman said the three huddled together, trying to get out texts and calls on a cellphone belonging to the injured man, who did not want to be named. Seconds after the injured man got up to the small storage room, five to six other people managed to reach the manager’s office and hide there.

Out on the patio, separated from the main floor in the club, partygoers poured out as they tried to escape.

“At first everybody on the patio just stood there for a second as the first rounds went off — then more rounds went off, then more,” Mr. Rivera said. “Then people were everywhere, running out, climbing over the patio fence, jumping over each other, just trying to get out.”

Mr. Rivera said he watched in horror as a brief gun battle ensued between the first police officers on the scene and the gunman, before the officers drew back to regroup, outgunned by Mr. Mateen’s semiautomatic rifle. “Within a minute, there was a swarm of cops everywhere,” he said.

Mr. Mateen emptied his magazine of ammunition, reloaded, emptied, loaded, emptied, loaded — over and over, Mr. Roman said.

“I heard him laugh,” said Mr. Roman, 30, of Kissimmee, who was born in Panama. “I heard him change the magazines and throw them down when he was done; it was so fast. He knew what he was doing. Then the light tech said to me, ‘This guy knows what he’s doing,’ and at that moment I knew my life was truly in danger.”

Mr. Roman described hearing hundreds of rounds of ammunition being fired.

“It never stopped,” he said.

Mr. Roman, who has two sons, tried to call his wife, and got through. But just as he did, Mr. Mateen discovered several people hiding in the room below where the three men were huddled, and opened fire on them.

Moans and cries for help could be heard as the relentless gunman fired again, Mr. Roman and Mr. Rivera said.

“The word was that if you weren’t dead, he would finish you off,” said Mr. Rivera, 42, a father of five and a grandfather of three.

As Mr. Roman hid inside, Mr. Rivera was shuttled blocks away by the police, where he was questioned and asked to fill out witness forms. He was not done until 7 a.m.

For Mr. Roman, as 5 a.m. approached, things finally changed.

He said a SWAT unit raced into the club, shooting Mr. Mateen and going room to room, checking the club. Initially, the police called up to the D.J. booth area, where Mr. Roman hid, thinking it was clear. He and the others had to announce themselves.

As they came down the ladder, the first thing Mr. Roman recalls seeing was pools of blood everywhere. He recalled it looking like a “Halloween horror” scene, the colorful overhead lights of the club still spinning onto the floor where dozens lay dead.

“I’m trying to walk through with dead bodies everywhere — bulging eyes, contorted bodies,” he said. “There was more people on the ground than where you could walk and where there weren’t bodies, there was thick blood.”

Mr. Rivera said he has awakened each morning since then to thoughts of the carnage.

Mr. Roman wonders if there was anything that could have been done differently.

“What could I have done better that day?” he said. “But in the end — it’s out of our hands. It’s out of our hands. It replays in my head, though.”

Both men’s D.J. equipment is still in the club, part of the crime scene. Mr. Roman was allowed to retrieve his car from the Pulse parking lot on Wednesday. Mr. Rivera got his on Friday.

The two have day jobs, but they have taken time off to try to absorb what happened.

They want to get back to D.J. work but at the same time are reluctant.

“We have a custom with our music, and it’s going to take us a bit to get back into the mood,” Mr. Roman said.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/18/opinion/pride-after-orlando.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Before the parade last weekend, my friends and I talked about Orlando, we talked about gun violence, we talked about horrible things politicians had posted, then deleted. There were rainbow streamers and inflatable unicorns and the flat knowledge that 49 people had been executed the night before for being gay. We walked the half block down to the parade, and it was alive. Go-go boys on fire trucks, Dykes on Bikes, serried ranks of L.G.B.T. Methodists mixed with dance music and light inebriation into a good time. It got better.

Our reaction wasn’t somber. We didn’t cancel the parade. We had fun. That is what gay people do. Every gay, trans or lesbian adult I know had to fight hard against family and social training to be an out, proud person. Our answer to loss and indignity, it seems, is to give a party, have a parade, and celebrate bits of happiness.

The uprising at Stonewall, our most famous civil rights moment, happened at a bar. It wasn’t noble or solemn, it was drunk, surly, and there were sequins involved. Those trans women and drag queens didn’t just stage a polite protest about repealing sodomy laws or cross-dressing prohibitions. They fought back against a police force invading our bar, the one place where the simple right to get a vodka soda and make out with a cute gay girl or boy in peace was something we could take for granted. It may seem frivolous, but when society has denied you dignity, honesty and safety, frivolity is all you’ve got.

And frivolity still comes through. When I logged into Grindr, a gay hookup app, on Sunday night, I was first greeted with a pop-up that let me know where and how I could help victims of the Pulse shootings. In the parade, drag queens and naked dancers held up homemade signs remembering the people who had died for having the kind of fun we were enjoying. In the evening, one of my friends noted that Carly Rae Jepsen was going to be performing on the pride stage at the same time the Tonys were airing, and that was the real hate crime.

It’s a dark, cruel joke, but ours is a culture that is not unfamiliar with darkness and cruelty. When people kill us, pass laws against us, make cheap jokes about us, they aren’t actually saying all gay people should die. They’re saying all L.G.B.T. people should know our place, live in silence, lie about who we are. Societal homophobia wants us to be ashamed, and finds ways to punish us if we refuse. The greatest gay rebellion is honest expression of our truth.

When word surfaced that the Orlando shooter had frequented gay bars and dating apps, some speculated that he might have been doing research to plan his attack. Gay people understood the other very real possibility, that the attacker might be a man with homosexual desires whom society had filled with so much secret shame that he would do anything to prove his distance from the gay world. It’s a tragic, complex truth that means however revolting I find him, I also have sympathy for the ways shame and the inability to live honestly may have twisted this man into a murderer.

The people who were at Pulse nightclub in Orlando on Saturday made the choice to be out and gay, and they paid a horrible price for it. The people who were out in West Hollywood on Sunday, and who will come out around the country this month, were there for all the L.G.B.T. people before us who suffered and struggled to be out and honest, and we did it with pride.",nytimes.com,True

Re “The Threat to Gay Americans” (editorial, June 15):

In America’s paper of record, I’m astonished to see an editorial condemning entire constituencies (Republicans and conservatives) for the atmosphere surrounding the atrocity in Orlando.

Some Republicans and conservatives espouse positions, in a free society, that engender pain and discomfort, and we should discuss those policy positions. But to implicitly blame men and women of good will who may not support the entire L.G.B.T. agenda for the actions of a depraved terrorist contributes to the partisan rancor afflicting the nation.

“For Gays Across America, a Massacre Punctuates Fitful Gains” (front page, June 13) reported that F.B.I. statistics show that 18.6 percent of the “single-bias hate crimes” committed in 2015 were against L.G.B.T. people. But that number tells only part of the story.

We analyzed 14 years of F.B.I. data and found that, given their proportion of the population, L.G.B.T. people are victimized by violent hate crimes far more than any other minority group. They are more than twice as likely to be attacked as black people; more than four times as likely as Muslims; and nearly 14 times as likely as Latinos.

Hate crimes against all groups are a far more serious problem in America than even the F.B.I.’s annual statistics indicate. A 2013 Department of Justice study found that there are about 260,000 of all types of hate crimes committed each year — 25 to 40 times more than the numbers reported by the F.B.I. For this reason, the F.B.I. figures and the comparisons we’ve made should be considered suggestive, not definitive.

Regarding “Hillary Clinton Mocks Donald Trump’s National Security Ideas” (nytimes.com, June 16):

Hillary Clinton, in discussing the recent terrorist attack, mocked Donald Trump’s call for keeping dangerous persons from entering the country when she quipped, “I don’t know how one builds a wall to keep the internet out,” followed by laughter in the audience.

You can indeed build a “wall” to block certain websites that spew jihadist calls for violence and that inspire domestic terrorists such as the one who committed the slaughter in Orlando. There are a number of ways to do this, as France, Britain and other countries are doing. True, there are First Amendment concerns that must be considered, but foreign-based terrorists and groups do not enjoy protection under our First Amendment to spew their calls for violence.

ORLANDO, Fla. — The night was a getaway. A young woman fresh out of high school was on vacation with her cousin and close friend, dancing without a care. It was Latin night at the gay nightclub. She had suggested that the three come here and was so excited that she sprang onto a stage to dance as strangers tossed dollar bills her way.

The night was a reunion. Two old friends who had drifted apart bumped into each other in the swirl of salsa and hip-hop beats on the dance floor. They apologized, hugged, made plans to have lunch the next day. As they got ready to leave, one of them joked about being so young, the span of years lying before them.

The night was a party. At the back bar, another three friends sipped their final drinks of the night — vodka, soda and lime, a vodka and Red Bull — and scrawled playful notes to the bartender on their receipt. “Sexy Kitten.” “You the best.”

The night was ending. Just before 2 a.m., a D.J. on the club patio was spinning reggae to wind things down. Then, a noise. Firecrackers? The D.J. lowered the volume.

Gunshots.

‘Boom, Boom, Boom’

Video

Jeannette McCoy was standing at the bar when the room exploded. “Boom, boom, boom,” she said.

She was hit with a flurry of debris as bullets tore into walls and plaster. A woman next to her was shot, and Ms. McCoy, 37, ran for the patio, climbing over people, tripping over them as they crouched to avoid the spray of bullets, trying somehow to brace her body to take the bullet she feared was coming her way.

When she got outside, she ran to the front of the club, now crowded with police officers and scores of the wounded. “And I’m screaming at them to go in the building,” she said. She found a friend, Juan, who had been shot in the leg. She took off her shirt and used it to stanch the bleeding.

‘He Shoots the Girl Next to Me’

Angel Colon was hit three times in the leg as he raced for the door. He fell and was trampled by fleeing patrons as he tried to get back up. His left leg was shattered. All he could do was lie on the floor, hearing screams and bangs as the gunman left the room. When he returned, he started shooting people on the floor to make sure they were dead.

Photo

“I look over, and he shoots the girl next to me,” Mr. Colon said, speaking to reporters at Orlando Regional Medical Center this week, where he was being treated. “And I’m just there laying down, and I’m thinking: ‘I’m next. I’m dead.’ So I don’t know how, but by the glory of God, he shoots toward my head but it hits my hand, and then he shoots me again and it hits the side of my hip. I had no reaction. I was just prepared to just stay there, laying down so he won’t know that I’m alive.”

The gunman turned his attention to arriving police officers, exchanging gunfire before backing off to another room. One officer dragged Mr. Colon through broken glass to the street and then to a nearby Wendy’s.

“I wish I could remember his face or his name,” Mr. Colon said of the officer. “I’m grateful for him.”

‘Love U’

Eighty miles away in Spring Hill, Fla., Santos Rodriguez was up late playing Rainbow Six Siege, a first-person shooter video game, when his phone lit up with texts from his older brother, Jeff.

Photo

“I beenx shot at club…. dying i love u.”

“Dead bodies on top of me…. tell everyone i lovethrm.”

“Huh?” Santos replied.

Theirs was a relationship of sarcasm, Santos said. Always cracking jokes. This had to be another one.

But Jeff, who was bleeding, persisted.

“Love u.”

Santos, 29, searched the internet and saw it was no joke. He woke his parents, told his wife to watch the children, and raced to Orlando, skimming across the dark freeway at 100 miles per hour.

It wasn’t until 7 that night that the family found out that Jeff Rodriguez, 37, had survived.

‘God Forgive Me’

As Leydiana Puyarena raced from the gunshots, people fell around her, some tugging at her feet and pulling off her shoes.

Ms. Puyarena, 33, saw a woman standing frozen, looking back toward the shots. She grabbed the woman, and they ducked into one of the bathrooms in the club, the one closest to the back patio. She tried to listen over the panicked noise of the 15 people in the bathroom, telling the others to calm down or they would all die.

She sat on the toilet, huddled with the bloodied group. She heard gunshots. She heard the gunman screaming in what sounded like a foreign language. She heard the gunshots getting closer.

“God forgive me for everything that I’ve done,” she prayed. “Take care of my kids, please.”

The gunman never came into their bathroom, she said, and after about half an hour, Ms. Puyarena said she looked to a man next to her, and they decided to try to run. But as they got up to leave, she said, a police officer banged on the bathroom door. The officer rushed them out through a back exit.

It was only after she was outside that an officer pointed out her bloody left calf, and she realized she had been shot. Only then did the pain set in.

‘I Don’t Want to Die’

Stanley Almodovar III, 23, was shot three times, staggered out of the club and fell to the ground. He was one of 49 people killed.

When Norman Casiano, 25, heard the shots, he dropped to the floor and crawled toward the two bathrooms at the back of the club. He crammed himself into a handicapped stall with maybe 20 others.

Photo

A young man stumbled into the bathroom, bleeding, and groped toward the stall. Mr. Casiano tried to pull him in underneath the partition, but there were just so many people and the young man was in such pain. Mr. Casiano tried to reassure him, saying that maybe the gunman wouldn’t find them in the bathroom.

“He looks me in the eye and said, ‘I don’t want to die, I don’t want to die,’ ” Mr. Casiano said.

Then the gunman was in the bathroom. He laughed.

“I just hear one solid gunshot, and you see the boy, just completely, you saw the life leave him.”

He started shooting at the stall. Two shots pierced Mr. Casiano. Another cut down a young woman who had been standing next to him. People begged him to stop, to spare them, trying to assure him they hadn’t seen his face. He reached his gun over the stall wall and shot into the cluster of people.

As the screaming died down, people slumped to the floor. Some were playing dead. Others were not playing.

When the gunman left the bathroom, Mr. Casiano knew it was time to go. He climbed out of the stall, stepping on bodies to make it out. He saw flashlights from police officers who were trying to penetrate the club and rescue people. He escaped. It was less than an hour into the three-hour siege.

‘It’s Not Real to Me’

Akyra Monet Murray, 18, was celebrating her high school graduation on a weeklong vacation from Philadelphia with her cousin, Tiara Parker, and her close friend, Patience Carter, both 20.

Ms. Murray, a basketball point guard who wanted to study criminology, and Ms. Carter, a New York University student, had made it out of the club. But when they realized that Ms. Parker was not with them, they went back in for her. “I told her, ‘Let’s get Tiara; we’ve got to get Tiara,’ ” Ms. Carter said at a news conference at Florida Hospital Orlando, recalling her words to Ms. Murray.

When they realized their way out was blocked, the three retreated to the cramped bathroom, struggling to fit their bodies inside an overcrowded stall.

The gunman entered the bathroom, grumbling that his gun had jammed, Ms. Parker said in an interview. Some of the people around her thought they could seize the opportunity and rush him, but as they tried to open the stall door, he began shooting, hitting the three young women and many others.

Ms. Carter fell to the floor, her femur shattered by a bullet.

Over the course of the siege, the gunman asked his hostages if they knew about the shooting last year in South Carolina in which a white man had killed nine African-Americans inside a prominent black church, Ms. Parker said. He got on the phone with the authorities, pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State and said he had enough bombs to “light up a city block,” Ms. Parker said. Then he asked about race; the three women are black.

“He asked if there are any black people in here; I was too afraid to answer,” Ms. Carter said. “But there was an African-American man in the stall where most of my body was, and he said, ‘Yes, there are about 6 or 7 of us.’ And the gunman responded by saying: ‘You know, I don’t have a problem with black people. This is about my country; you guys have suffered enough.’ ”

All through this, the three women devised a signal to show one another they were still alive. They began patting one another on the arm, scratching a wrist, grasping a hand and waiting for an answered grip. For three hours, pat pat. Pat pat. A Morse code of silent touches.

“Every time a phone rang or a text message went off, he would say, ‘Give it up, where is it?’ ” Ms. Carter said. When someone else’s phone rang, he demanded to have it. She slid hers out from the stall, hoping to appease him. Finally, right before the police burst in, there was another round of gunfire. Someone shielded Ms. Carter’s body with his or her own, taking a bullet to spare her.

Ms. Murray was bleeding, and the last time Ms. Parker saw her was as the police broke through the walls of the bathroom and pulled Ms. Parker away. As they left the club, she said she pleaded with them to take Ms. Murray out first. On Monday morning, the family learned she was listed among the dead.

Ms. Carter, racked with guilt, is second-guessing herself. “If I would have just told Akyra to stay outside,” she said, her voice trailing off.

Ms. Parker knows everything that happened is all too real, but sometimes it does not feel quite that way. Ms. Murray’s things are still in their vacation condo. The family is still in this palm-fringed world they had dreamed of visiting for the past six months.

“I want her to just walk through that front door,” Ms. Parker said. “I didn’t expect her to leave me like this. It’s not real to me. I know it. But I don’t believe it.”",nytimes.com,True

But never before has it been so powerfully seized as a weapon of mass reflection.

Social media is just the latest platform for the political kiss. The #TwoMenKissing hashtag and its compatriots, #TwoWomenKissing and #GaysBreaktheInternet, have deep roots that predate internet activism.

Many say credit for the hashtag goes to K. M. Soehnlein, a San Francisco-based author and activist. In the 1980s, he helped organize “kiss-ins” to protest homophobia and H.I.V./AIDS discrimination.

Mr. Soehnlein, 50, saw the kiss-in protests, he said this week, as “a kind of activism that was in people’s faces, but it wasn’t yelling.”

The online kisses shared after Orlando have made it easier for people in the gay community to reach one another across geography. There “are lot more of us who are willing to put a face to the movement,” said Mr. Soehnlein, a founder of the activist group Queer Nation. He joined the organic campaign, sharing a photo of himself kissing his husband, Kevin Clarke.

Gran Fury, an art collective that placed subversive art in public spaces as a protest against homophobia, designed a poster in the spring of 1988 to spread word of the original kiss-ins. Emblazoned with the words “Read My Lips” and a photograph of two sailors kissing, the poster was distributed around New York.

Avram Finkelstein, 64, an artist and former member of Gran Fury, said the words written on the back of that poster, a long declaration titled “Why We Kiss,” was something of a harbinger of this week’s hashtag activism. “Gay men and lesbians exist. We exist in all cultures. We always have, we always will,” the poster’s text reads, in part.

The photos shared on social media are just a way to keep reinforcing that idea. Mr. Finkelstein said: “People are using their bodies to register their presence in the world. It’s like going on the record with the one thing you’re born with and die with: your body.”

But Mr. Collins, the television producer who has been with his husband for 22 years, said that social media support can’t completely eradicate the real-life worry of physical danger for those who express public affection.

“One stray kiss or a moment of my husband and I holding hands runs the risk of someone saying something awful,” he said, “or being attacked.”

Mr. Soehnlein said that the responses to his social-media posts were overwhelmingly positive, though he noted that the negative comments were vehement. On Instagram one stranger commented beneath a kissing photo, “They should have killed all of you.” Mr. Soehnlein said he deleted the comment.

Other online critics said that children should be shielded from such images, he said, which didn’t surprise him.

And on Sunday morning, during the siege at Pulse, “Mateen apparently searched for ‘Pulse Orlando’ and ‘Shooting.’”

More information came to light Thursday about Mr. Mateen’s troubled work and school history, and about his actions leading up to the slaughter at Pulse nightclub on Sunday that left 49 people dead and 53 wounded in the worst mass shooting in United States history.

In the weeks before the shooting, Mr. Mateen, 29, went to a gun store here in Jensen Beach, Fla., and tried to buy high-grade body armor and at least 1,000 rounds of ammunition, said a co-owner of the store, Robert Abell. He said the store, Lotus Gunworks, did not stock the type of armor sought by Mr. Mateen, who lived nearby, and a salesman grew suspicious of Mr. Mateen’s behavior during a visit that lasted perhaps five minutes, including a telephone conversation he conducted in a foreign language, and refused to sell him bulk ammunition.

“Something in his gut told him it was wrong,” Mr. Abell said of the employee. He said the store contacted the F.B.I., but had no information by which to identify the customer; only after the killings did an employee recognize Mr. Mateen, who used an assault rifle and a handgun in the attack.

“Unfortunately, nobody connected the dots, and he slipped under the cracks, and this is where we’re at now,” he said.

School records released under public records requests showed that Mr. Mateen, who was born in Queens and grew up in Florida, was frequently in trouble as a child, and struggled to keep pace academically, especially in the early grades. He was disciplined 31 times in elementary and middle school, with one report when he was in third grade including a sweeping list of concerns. He was “constantly moving, verbally abusive, rude, aggressive,” the report said, often put his hands on other students, disrupted class and engaged in “much talk about violence & sex.”

In high school, he was repeatedly suspended, for a total of 48 days, in a span of less than two years, and attended three different schools. The last suspension came two days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The Martin County School District found no detailed records of what prompted the penalty, said Kim Sabol, a lawyer for the district, but former classmates have told news organizations that he celebrated the attacks, sparking conflicts with other students.

In May 2001, when he was 14, he was suspended twice for fighting, and one of those times he was arrested, according to personnel records from his later work for the State Department of Corrections. In a note explaining the incident to the department, he wrote he was not taken to jail, and “the charge of battery was adjudicated and the charge of disturbing school function was dropped.”

From October 2006 to April 2007, Mr. Mateen worked for the Florida Department of Corrections as a corrections officer trainee, earning $1,123.35 every two weeks, according to state records. He was dismissed but the records do not say why, except that it was not for misconduct. He received middling scores on a performance evaluation.

“From the beginning of this, officers were running inside and trying to save people,” Capt. Mark Canty said. “They were setting up around the outside trying to figure out how to get people out.”

Officers rescued people escape throughout a three-hour standoff, including removing an air conditioner from a wall to allow several people in one room to climb out.

Officials decided to storm the club after Mr. Mateen threatened to strap himself and hostages with explosives, which later turned out to have been a bluff. Law enforcement teams used explosives to try to blow a hole in the outer wall of the club, but they did not completely breach it. Then they used an armored vehicle to make a hole by ramming the building, but they had to do it repeatedly, Mr. Canty said, trying to find the spot where some people were trapped.

A battery pack that officers saw through the bomb squad robot camera — which led them to believe there were explosives inside — turned out to have been from an exit sign or a smoke detector, Mayor Buddy Dyer said.

Federal law enforcement officials said Thursday that the F.B.I. is increasingly skeptical of reports that Mr. Mateen was gay but “closeted,” that he had been visiting gay clubs or that he had used gay dating apps. The bureau has recovered the Samsung phone he used the night of the attack, and is trying to retrieve data from it.

Investigators believe his wife, Noor Zahi Salman, drove Mr. Mateen to Pulse within a week or two of the shooting, apparently to assess the target, the officials said. She has told agents that she tried to talk her husband out of mounting an attack, and Justice Department say it is not clear if she will face criminal charges.

Officials say he was influenced by radical propaganda that he found online, but so far have found no direct connection to any larger organization.

On Thursday, the Central Intelligence Agency director, John O. Brennan, gave a grim assessment of the prospects for more attacks. Though the Islamic State has been pushed back on battlefields in the Middle East, he said in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, “our efforts have not reduced the group’s terrorism capabilities and global reach.”

This was both an act of domestic terror and a hate crime, but it is ours and it demands that we consider our policies — foreign and war policy, antiterror policy, gun policy — and our cultural toxicities, including our toxic political culture, toxic male culture and toxic anti-L.G.B.T. culture.

It has been reported that Mateen visited the bar that became the scene of his carnage many times over many years, even taking his wife along on at least one visit. Was he casing the place, or was he there for other, more intimate reasons? It’s not clear at this point. He is also reported to have been on mobile apps that men use to meet other men. Was he looking for information or for a match? Not clear.

Was he a self-loathing closeted man somewhere on the queer spectrum who targeted people who personified his conflict? Not clear. In a series of tweets Sunday, the Miami Herald reporter David Ovalle revealed that according to “one of Mateen’s ex-coworkers” Mateen had made homophobic and racist comments. His ex-wife has said that during their brief marriage, which she describes as abusive, she questioned whether he was “totally straight,” although even her suspicions relied on homophobic stereotypes. None of this is conclusive, of course, but it raises questions whose answers would have a direct impact on motive.

Studies have shown that homophobia can sometimes be an acting out of an intent to control the homophobe’s own same-sex desires, that to oppress or silence queerness in others is a perverted attempt to silence it in oneself. I’m not saying that was Mateen’s motivation, simply that this phenomenon is a very real one.

What is indisputable is that Mateen specifically targeted the L.G.B.T. community in one of its safest spaces, and did so on a specific night — “Latin night” — and that must remain at the forefront of our inquiry as details emerge and motives are assigned.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

While our society surely does not treat L.G.B.T. people as barbarically as some others, disdain is still present in the belief that identities that are not strictly hetero-normative are immoral, corrosive and corruptive, and violate the laws of nature and the commands of God. Until we rid our society of this rigid and wrongheaded thinking, we apply pressure on citizens not to walk openly and lovingly in their own truths, and we give cover to the darkest possible objections from people like Mateen.

In addition, we must carefully consider, once again, how easy it is for people of ill intent to obtain deadly weapons. Even if you believe strongly in the Second Amendment, and are intimate with gun culture (as I am), there is still no reason for a citizen to own an assault rifle unless he is planning an assault. None! You don’t hunt deer with assault rifles. You don’t keep the vermin out of the garden with assault rifles. These military-style guns are specifically designed for the rapid killing of human beings. Let’s assign the weapons of war to the battlefield.

Furthermore, we must re-examine how we can restrict suspected terrorists’ access to guns, at least the deadliest ones. As CNN reported this week: “People on the United States’ terrorist watch list passed background checks and have been allowed to purchase firearms 91 percent of the time in 2015, updated federal data shows.” Mateen wasn’t on this list, so his purchases wouldn’t have been restricted anyway, but still this number should scare us profoundly.

Mass shootings are only a fraction of our gun violence epidemic. Around 33,000 people die each year in gun-related deaths in this country, many in small-number homicides that have becomes a sort of ambient horror to which we are growing worrisomely numb, and many others are suicides or unintentional deaths, which include a disturbing number of children.

This norm of ours simply isn’t normal. Too many of us are making a conscious — and unconscionable! — decision to do nothing or to not do more. There is so much blood on our hands that no amount of Second Amendment rationalizing can wash them clean. To paraphrase Macbeth, our hands would stain the sea scarlet and turn the green one red.

Lastly, we must remember that our foreign policy — whether bombing Muslims or banning them — has consequences. Seeking to diminish one threat can inflame another. Wars and reckless rhetoric are governed by the laws of unintended consequences, so we must tread carefully.

The Muslim community, like any other, is composed primarily of peace-loving people who despise violence. But that community, like any other, also has a small population of weak-minded people prone to violence. The difference in this moment is that unlike other populations, foreign terrorists are specifically targeting the vulnerable among the Muslim population for indoctrination and radicalization. What we must do as a society is thwart these efforts, not enable them.

“For all of us who were worried that the conservative backlash in this country would bring about unnamed terrible things, the future is now.”

The words appeared on the front page of a gay newspaper, heralding an article about bar patrons being gunned down where they stood. They were not written this week, but 36 years ago, describing a spasm of violence that fewer and fewer people now recall.

They were written by the reporter Andy Humm as he told readers of The New York City News on Nov. 28, 1980, what most of them already knew: that a former transit police officer had rampaged through Greenwich Village, killing two men and wounding six.

“West Street Massacre,” the headline read.

Shortly before 11 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 19, a 38-year-old former transit police officer named Ronald K. Crumpley opened fire outside a deli at Washington and Charles Streets, cutting down Richard Huff, 30, and Rene Matute, 23.

The gunman then made his way to West Street, between 10th and Christopher Streets, a blockfront shared by the Ramrod, a popular leather bar, and Sneakers, a gay dive.

Video

“He aimed his Uzi at a group of men standing in line outside the Ramrod bar and squeezed the trigger,” Edward M. Alwood wrote in “Straight News: Gays, Lesbians and the News Media.”

“Blood spattered against the wall and door as bullets ripped into one man’s shoulder and another man’s arm,” Mr. Alwood wrote. “In barely the time it takes to light a cigarette, 40 rounds tore into the crowd.

“As bullets sprayed the front window of the bar, panic swept the crowd inside. Customers dropped to the floor. Several crawled to a stairway at the back of the building in a desperate attempt to survive.”

Vernon Kroening, 32, an organist at nearby St. Joseph’s Roman Catholic Church, was killed instantly. Jorg Wenz, a 24-year-old Dutch immigrant working as a doorman at the Ramrod, died at St. Vincent’s Hospital after an hourslong struggle by doctors to save his life.

Olaf Gravesen, 37, and John Litaker, 36, were wounded out on the sidewalk. John Gamrecki, 27, was hit inside the Ramrod. Thomas Ron, 54, was hit inside Sneakers. (Different accounts give varying name spellings and ages for the victims.)

Mr. Crumpley made it plain to the police that he would have been satisfied with a higher toll.

“I’ll kill them all — the gays — they ruin everything,” he was reported to have said.

Though nowhere near as deadly as the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., or the arson fire at the UpStairs Lounge in New Orleans that killed 32 in 1973, the West Street rampage chills those who remember it.

“It was especially stunning because it was hitting at the heart of what was the epicenter of gay life,” Mr. Alwood said this week.

Mr. Humm recalled on Monday that the attack occurred 15 days after Ronald Reagan had been elected president and the Republicans had taken control of the Senate from the Democrats. “It was like a bomb had gone off in New York,” he said.

A vigil drew 1,500 mourners to Sheridan Square in Greenwich Village, Mr. Humm reported at the time. “There were few, if any, calls for the blood of Ronald Crumpley,” he wrote. “Anger was directed at the system which treats gay people as a subhuman species.”

At a memorial service, David Rothenberg, a member of the city’s Human Rights Commission, spoke tenderly of Mr. Kroening. “I recall my last seeing him and my instinct was to hug him goodbye, but I have been sufficiently trained not to make such public demonstrations,” he said. “I think in the future, when I want to hug someone, I won’t deny myself that.”

The next night, a Mass for Mr. Kroening was celebrated at St. Joseph’s without mention of the fact that he had been killed because of his homosexuality. When mourners confronted the pastor, Mr. Humm said, he replied, “Everyone is welcome here, but not if they wear big H’s on their backs.”

In 1981, a jury found Mr. Crumpley “not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect” for the murders and attempted murders. He was confined to secure psychiatric hospitals and died in April 2015, at 73.

The Ramrod and Sneakers are long gone. Andrea Cohen, an owner of Bongo restaurant, where the Ramrod was, said numerous patrons knew about the killings. “Actually,” she said, “they told me what happened early on when I was opening Bongo at this location.” She has posted a sign in the bathroom with a short narrative of the event and a photo of the bar.

Still, it seems that the Ramrod killings have largely been forgotten. When mourners gathered spontaneously on Sunday to show their solidarity with Orlando, they came to the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street — not to the site of New York’s own massacre.

Perhaps, though, “overshadowed” may be a better word than “forgotten.” Eight months after the killings on West Street, an article appeared on Page A20 of The New York Times.

As families began planning funerals for the victims of Sunday’s rampage at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., gay Americans mourned a loss that extended beyond the lives cut short.

Omar Mateen shattered the tenuous, hard-fought sense of personal safety that many gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans have begun to feel as the movement for equality has made significant gains in recent years. His bullets and the blood he left behind that early morning were a reminder that in many corners of the country, gay and transgender people are still regarded as sinners and second-class citizens who should be scorned.

While the precise motivation for the rampage remains unclear, it is evident that Mr. Mateen was driven by hatred toward gays and lesbians. Hate crimes don’t happen in a vacuum. They occur where bigotry is allowed to fester, where minorities are vilified and where people are scapegoated for political gain. Tragically, this is the state of American politics, driven too often by Republican politicians who see prejudice as something to exploit, not extinguish.

Since the 1990s, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans have made considerable progress in the fight for equality under the law. By living openly and proudly, they have changed society’s attitudes about sexual orientation and gender identity. That shift has prompted politicians who were once wary about embracing equal rights for L.G.B.T. Americans — including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — to become resolute allies. The 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage was celebrated by many in the gay community as the crowning achievement of a decades-long quest for respect and dignity.

Yet, that fight remains far from over. Since the marriage ruling, several Republican-led state legislatures and Republican governors and federal lawmakers have redoubled their fight against legal protections for people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. So far this year, more than 200 anti-L.G.B.T. bills have been introduced in 34 states.

Donald Trump, unlike some other prominent Republicans, called the Orlando massacre what it was: an attack on gay people. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, could not even offer that recognition to a community in pain.

Yet, Mr. Trump has vowed to choose Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality, and he supports the deceptively named First Amendment Defense Act, an effort to approve discrimination against gay and transgender people nationwide under the guise of religious freedom. And Mr. Trump backtracked from his statement that transgender people should be able to use the restroom consistent with their gender identity after Senator Ted Cruz used his words to attack him during the nomination fight.

That restrooms have become such a fixation, particularly at the state level, is a worrying reminder of the entrenched stigma the community continues to face. The loudest advocates of this odious effort have been Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina and Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who has worked in lock step with the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton. Meanwhile, Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi in April signed into law a bill that allows discrimination against L.G.B.T. people in schools and the workplace.

It’s hard to say how many politicians take these positions as a matter of principle and how many do so because it has proved to be an effective way in the past to raise money and turn out the vote. As the funerals are held for those who perished on Sunday, lawmakers who have actively championed discriminatory laws and policies, and those who have quietly enabled them with votes, should force themselves to read the obituaries and look at the photos. The 49 people killed in Orlando were victims of a terrorist attack. But they also need to be remembered as casualties of a society where hate has deep roots.",nytimes.com,True

The massacre of 49 people at a gay club in Orlando, Fla., on Sunday by a gunman claiming inspiration from the Islamic State resonated instantly around the world. Though it echoed recent terrorist attacks in Paris, Brussels, Beirut and Bamako, it also raised painful memories of attacks targeting gay men and women, from the arson at a gay bar in New Orleans in 1973 that took 32 lives to the nail-bomb explosion at a London pub in 1999.

Yet despite the messages of condolence and outrage from world leaders — several of whom were silent about the sexual orientation of the victims — and the heartening displays of solidarity as rainbow colors lighted up the Eiffel Tower and Sydney’s Harbour Bridge, the fact is, gay rights remain elusive in much of the world. In at least 74 countries, being gay is a crime. In at least 10 countries, gay sex is a crime punishable by death.

In Russia, a noxious “gay propaganda” law enacted in 2013 is being used to prosecute people for such offenses as publishing a poem or posts on social media that refer to same-sex love. In India, a colonial-era law criminalizing sex “against the order of nature” rarely results in convictions but remains a powerful tool to harass gay men and lesbians.

As with Donald Trump in America, hatemongering is on the rise around the world, as authoritarian leaders and right-wing nationalist groups target the immigrant, the gay man or the minority citizen as a scapegoat for frustrations. “Hate is becoming mainstreamed,” Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, warned on Monday.

David Pressman, the deputy United States ambassador to the United Nations, pressed member nations on Monday to unite to protect “the universal dignity of all persons regardless of who they love.” Russia, China, India and the African Group, the Islamic Group and the “Friends of the Family” group at the United Nations have in the past opposed modest efforts on gay rights. It was a promising sign that they did not object Tuesday when the Security Council issued a statement condemning the Orlando attack and specifically said victims were targeted “as a result of their sexual orientation.”

The United Nations now needs to extend all human rights protections to cover sexual orientation and gender identity. That, and the elimination of laws that criminalize being gay, would be a far better tribute to the Orlando victims than displays of rainbow colors and ritual condemnations of yet another hate-fueled attack.",nytimes.com,True

If you’re not comfortable marching, mingle on the sidelines. If parades aren’t your thing, make an appearance at one of the other pride events in Kentucky in coming days.

Just show up. And by doing so, show that the absence of “gay” or “L.G.B.T.” in your statements immediately following the Orlando massacre — and in the statements of so many other prominent Republicans — isn’t because you place us and our concerns behind some thick pane of glass with a Do Not Touch sign that stays up even when blood and tears pool beneath it.

For more than 48 hours, Paul Ryan also seemed to avoid any mention of the kind of nightclub that the Orlando gunman chose and one of the reasons its revelers were marked for death.

On Tuesday morning that silence finally ended, as Ryan told journalists in Washington that he wanted to “be clear.”

“Members of the L.G.B.T. community were the targets,” he said. “They were simply attacked for who they are.”

He thus joined his 2012 running mate, Mitt Romney, who sent out a tweet midday Monday offering “a special prayer for the L.G.B.T. community that was the focus of this attack.”

Ryan also joined Donald Trump, who mentioned L.G.B.T. Americans repeatedly in his formal remarks on Monday afternoon, expressing “solidarity with the members of Orlando’s L.G.B.T. community” and asserting that the gunman wanted “to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.”

But more conspicuous than what Romney and Trump said was what so many other Republicans didn’t.

Bemoaning the carnage, they justly condemned the Islamic State and violent extremists. They rightly paid tribute to “first responders.”

But this specificity didn’t extend to the lives and loves of the people killed. Even Rick Scott, the Republican governor of Florida, initially sidestepped the subject, failing to emphasize that many of them spent their final terrified minutes in a place where they had sought precisely the comfort and belonging that they didn’t always feel on the other side of its walls.

We still have much to learn about the exact mix of the gunman’s motives. There are reports that he cased other locations. His unhinged diatribes apparently extended to women, blacks and Jews as well as gays.

His past behavior and his call to 911 demonstrated an overarching hatred of America, with its celebration of diversity and individual liberty. The revelers in Pulse epitomized that liberty, and what happened to them is part of a bigger story and a bigger struggle that affect all Americans.

But that doesn’t preclude an acknowledgment of their sexual orientations, and it doesn’t excuse any reluctance to discuss that.

Roman Catholic leaders, too, shied away. Statements by the bishop of Orlando and by the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said nothing about a gay nightclub or gays.

Such omissions so troubled the Rev. James Martin, a best-selling Jesuit author, that he posted a video commentary about them on Facebook on Monday afternoon. Twenty-four hours later, it had been viewed about 700,000 times.

“If the murders had happened, God forbid, in a church of a particular Christian denomination, Catholic leaders would decry the murders and then naturally express their solidarity with members of that denomination,” he said in the video, adding that for the most part, “this was not done for the grieving L.G.B.T. community.”

He told me on Tuesday that there were exceptions, including Bishop Robert Lynch of St. Petersburg, Fla., who wrote a blog post in which he conceded that religion, including Catholicism, “often breeds contempt for gays, lesbians and transgender people,” and that this contempt can lead to violence. Lynch stressed that the Orlando victims “were all made in the image and likeness of God.”

“We teach that,” Lynch wrote. “We should believe that. We must stand for that.”

“We” includes leaders of both parties. If Ted Cruz can mourn Orlando as an attack on gay people — which, in fact, he did — then every other Republican can, too.

This is one of those moments, in the wake of terror, when we find the most apt and evocative ways to underscore our oneness and renounce our fear. When we make grand gestures. When we make pointed ones.

So Majority Leader McConnell, pick your rally. Speaker Ryan, accompany him. Governor Scott, attend the funerals of gay victims. Other Republicans and Democrats, recognize L.G.B.T. Americans with both your words and your presence at gay pride celebrations.

Looking at a stone-faced crowd of Mr. Carson’s family and friends, Mr. Morales insisted that the killing was neither bias-motivated nor purposeful.

“What happened is a tragic accident,” he said. “In no part was it based on my bias toward anyone’s sexual relationship.”

Then, turning toward the judge, he added, “It is beyond my comprehension how someone like myself who happens to be bisexual and part of the L.G.B.T. community can be falsely accused and then convicted of a hate crime.”

Jurors deliberated for two days before rejecting Mr. Morales’s contention that his intimate relationships with transgender women proved he was not homophobic and that he did not kill Mr. Carson, 32, out of hatred toward gay people.

Instead, the jurors saw Mr. Morales’s behavior that evening as underscoring such prejudice.

Before his fatal encounter with Mr. Carson in May 2013, Mr. Morales stormed the Annisa restaurant on Barrow Street shouting antigay slurs and brandishing a weapon, after an employee there upbraided him for urinating on the sidewalk.

Mr. Morales left enraged and soon spotted Mr. Carson and Danny Robinson, a pair of friends from Brooklyn, dressed in shorts and tank tops. Mr. Morales taunted the men, calling them “gay wrestlers” and “faggots.” The friends challenged Mr. Morales’s mocking tone, and the confrontation moved into the shadow of a closed bookstore. There, Mr. Morales pulled out a revolver and shot Mr. Carson in the face while Mr. Robinson called the police.

Mr. Morales often flailed in offering explanations for his actions. After fleeing the scene of the murder, he told apprehending officers that he shot Mr. Carson “because he tried to act tough.” In a video taken during his arrest that Judge Bartley described as “chilling,” Mr. Morales laughed maniacally and exclaimed, “Diagnosis dead, doctor!”

At the trial itself, Mr. Morales claimed he acted in self-defense, afraid that the phone Mr. Robinson had retrieved was a weapon. The prosecution thwarted that notion, saying Mr. Morales had acted out of “bigotry” and “unjustifiable rage,” not fear.

During the sentencing, Mr. Morales first said that the shooting was “more so reckless than intentional,” then, in an inexplicable tirade, insinuated that emergency medical technicians had mistreated Mr. Carson, leading to his death.

The jury countenanced none of those justifications, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., lauded the stiff sentence. “Any life lost to gun violence is a tragedy for our city,” Mr. Vance said in a statement. “But homophobic, hate-fueled incidents like this one are particularly unconscionable. As we mourn the lives lost in Orlando, we remain committed to doing everything we can to combat and prevent crimes against L.G.B.T. New Yorkers.”

The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported in 2015 that 18.6 percent of the 5,462 so-called single-bias hate crimes in the previous year were because of the victim’s sexual orientation; 47 percent were attributable to race. A study by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs shows that 24 killings of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, and of those who are H.I.V.-positive, were reported in 2015, a 20 percent increase from the previous year. But their advocates have long contended that such numbers are underreported.

Shannon Lucey, the lead prosecutor, described Mr. Morales in court as having “a lot of self-loathing issues.” She noted that while he had sexual relationships with transgender people, he never appeared with them in public. Seeing Mr. Robinson and Mr. Carter together, Ms. Lucey argued, may have prompted Mr. Morales’s discomfort with his own sexuality.

After the verdict was rendered in March, one juror said that Mr. Morales’s actions that night showed that “he was kind of categorizing people,” in a manner that exposed his bias against gay people and that culminated in the shooting of Mr. Carson.

Still, for many, the ruling provides little solace.

“Sometimes a criminal case gives people a feeling of closure, but what happened in Orlando just overshadows everything at the moment and may well for a long time,” said Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.

Mr. Robinson was not able to attend the sentencing, but offered a statement saying, “The guilt of asking him to go out with me that night, it’s like I feel it’s my fault,” he said.

Outside the courtroom, Florine Bumpars, an aunt of Mr. Carson, spoke through tears as she castigated Mr. Morales.

The terrorist attack that killed 49 and wounded 53 in Orlando, Fla., was the largest mass killing of gay people in American history, but before Sunday that grim distinction was held by a largely forgotten arson at a New Orleans bar in 1973 that killed 32 people at a time of pernicious anti-gay stigma.

Churches refused to bury the victims’ remains. Their deaths were mostly ignored and sometimes mocked by politicians and the media. No one was ever charged. A joke made the rounds in workplaces and was repeated on the radio: “Where will they bury the queers? In fruit jars!”

Outpourings of grief from politicians and everyday people have followed the Orlando shooting, but for those who remember the fire in the New Orleans bar, the UpStairs Lounge, its lonely memory has loomed large over conversations about the carnage this week at the Pulse nightclub.

Video

Mike Moreau, 72, who lost several friends in the fire, said he was struck by all the differences between then and now, but also by the familiarity of tragedy’s dull ache.

“What happened to us had to be kept so private,” said Mr. Moreau. “The public didn’t want to know about it, and if they heard about it they didn’t care — ‘Thank God, they’re gone, they deserved it.’”

“To see the outpouring of love and support that these poor families have gotten is fantastic,” he added about the Orlando massacre. “They are hurting the same way we hurt, but at least they know that the world supports them and understands their grief.”

Mr. Moreau was with friends at a nearby bar on June 24, 1973, when an arsonist doused the stairs of the UpStairs Lounge with lighter fluid, set it aflame and rang the doorbell. When someone answered the door, a fireball burst into the room.

One group of patrons fled out a back exit, but another was trapped across the room, caught between the flames and floor-to-ceiling windows fitted with metal bars. When firefighters extinguished the blaze, they found a pile of charred bodies, some embracing and others pressed against the windows.

Congregants from the New Orleans chapter of the Metropolitan Community Church, an L.G.B.T.-affirming group, were meeting there after services. The Rev. Bill Larson was among the dead. His charred body was left slumped against the window bars in full view of passers-by for hours.

He was one of many who died without ever coming out to their families, and his mother would not deal with his remains, said Robert L. Camina, who directed a documentary, UpStairs Inferno, about the blaze.

“His mother refused to collect his ashes because she was too embarrassed that she had a gay son,” Mr. Camina said. “And that is just one example. There are three people who were never identified at all. Why? Somebody has to miss them.”

Those three were buried in unmarked graves in a potter’s field along with a fourth person, Ferris LeBlanc, whose family did not know his fate until last year, Mr. Camina said.

“They dug a hole in the ground and put a bag in it and covered it back up,” Mr. Moreau said.

Public figures were unsupportive. The mayor, Moon Landrieu, did not cancel his vacation. Forty years later, a son of his, the current mayor, Mitch Landrieu, declared a day of public mourning for the fire’s victims on its anniversary.

“L.G.B.T. people have a place at the table now that they did not have then,” said Clayton Delery-Edwards, who wrote a book about the arson that was published in 2014.

The fire was an open wound for the gay community in New Orleans for years. No one was charged with the attack, and a man viewed by many as the primary suspect was never arrested. He committed suicide a year after the blaze.

“There was never any sense of justice,” said Sebastian Rey, the president of the L.G.B.T. Community Center of New Orleans.

Survivors had to deny any connection to the fire, including the loss of loved ones, because they could lose their jobs or apartments if bosses and landlords suspected they were gay. Mr. Rey said people who lived through that period did not talk about it for decades. As time passed, the tragedy became “a rumor” to new generations of L.G.B.T. people, he said.

Johnny Townsend, who interviewed survivors in the late ’80s and finally published their accounts in 2014, said the 40th anniversary commemoration gave it a kind of public attention it had not had before. “People now feel more of a sense of their own history,” he said.

For Mr. Moreau, the outpouring of support for the victims in Orlando has been an “uplifting” sign of progress, he said.

""In Orlando, those poor people know at least that the whole world is behind them,” he said. “Nobody cared about us.”",nytimes.com,True

Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton and other city officials joined the commemoration, calling for calm, unity and gun legislation that would ban nationwide — as they are in New York — the military-style automatic weapon used in the attack and others like it.

“We passed gun control in this state,” said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, standing before a lectern festooned with a sign declaring “We Are Orlando,” and flanked by an American flag and a gay pride flag. “We outlawed assault weapons in this state. We know it can be done.”

He added, “Until we have a national policy, none of us are safe.”

Mr. de Blasio welcomed the thousands of people who had come “all in solidarity, all in common cause,” and he criticized those who were using the tragedy to turn Americans against one another.

“We do not accept anyone who would sow division or hatred,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said. “We do not accept the notion of any of our leaders sowing hatred and division part in the wake of tragedy. And that means you, Donald Trump.”

The crowd’s grief seemed magnified by the fact that Omar Mateen, who was born in New York, perpetrated the killings and that at least two victims identified by the authorities had roots in the city as well.

The New Yorkers who died at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, included Enrique Rios, 25, a student who lived with his grandmother in Brooklyn and was on vacation in Florida, and Shane Tomlinson, 33, a singer from Queens who had moved to Orlando.

Standing guard at the rally was a large squad of New York City police officers, many wearing counterterrorism gear. Mr. de Blasio said that no credible threats had been directed at New York, though the Orlando shooting had city officials here “on high alert.”

The authorities deployed hundreds of specialized officers and added uniformed police at heavily trafficked areas of Manhattan and at places popular among gay people, officials said.

“I can remember the days when cops were raiding this place,” said William Drummer, 91, watching the crowd thicken. “It touches my heart to see this kind of solidarity.”

Stacey Lentz, a co-owner of the Stonewall, said she felt comforted by the added protection, but also by throngs of people who have been gathering at the bar since Sunday morning, bedecking its red brick facade with flowers and cards, and overwhelming the street out front for the vigil.

“The L.G.B.T. community has survived so much before, from AIDS to hate crimes,” said Ms. Lentz, 46. “And we’re continuing to show that we’re strong and love wins.”

Still, Ms. Lentz acknowledged that like Pulse, her business was a potential target. “Those victims could’ve been any L.G.B.T. person at any bar around the country,” she said. “But gay bars have always been one place where we can feel free. We refuse to have that taken from us.”

Austin Wade said he had expected to spend June celebrating Gay Pride Month with parades and other celebrations. Instead last night he joined the demonstration, unable to shake the feeling that he could have been one of the 49 victims.

“I go to gay clubs all the time,” said Mr. Wade, a 27-year-old writer from Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn. “It could’ve been me on that dance floor.”

As day turned to night, each victim’s name and age was read aloud, while a stiff gust of wind whipped through the crowd. One by one, mourners lifted a hand to guard their candles, unwilling to let anything extinguish the flames.",nytimes.com,True

ORLANDO, Fla. — One of the survivors of Sunday’s attack at the nightclub Pulse, a man closeted from his family, called his Latin American parents abroad to tell them that a close friend — who was actually his partner — had died in the bar. Their response: “You weren’t in that bar, were you?”

That attitude, a throwback to an earlier era, seemed the rare exception as relatives of those gunned down in the club, many of them Puerto Rican, mourned their deaths and celebrated their lives on the streets of Orlando.

The moments of mourning seemed to show how far gay culture has progressed from a time when it was frequently hidden from loved ones.

And so Eddie Justice, a 30-year-old gay accountant, texted his mother, Mina, “Mommy, I love you,” as bullets flew and the gunman, Omar Mateen, headed toward the Pulse bathroom where he was hiding, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Justice was confirmed dead on Monday.

In the hours since the attack, there have been countless homages on social media posted by friends and relatives, who extolled the accomplishments of their loved ones and embraced their sexual identity.

And there were the families of the anguished victims, who gathered around tables and in conference rooms to await word about whether their sons, daughters, cousins or uncles — gay or straight — had died.

It is a seismic shift from the atmosphere four decades ago after the firebombing of the UpStairs lounge in New Orleans. Back in 1973, some relatives refused to claim the bodies of their gay sons, banishing them to potter’s fields and the New Orleans community joked that the ashes of the dead would be buried in “fruit jars.” Thirty-two people died.

It is not necessary to reach that far back to feel the progress, which has galloped swiftly ahead in the past 10 years. Despite setbacks and plenty of lingering hate, a new generation of gay people and lesbians feels far less weighed down by stigma and fear in today’s rapidly evolving embrace of gay rights.

“A mother texting with her son and saying he was afraid and he was going to die,” said Juan Cantu, a theatrical director of Mexican descent who lives here and was once a Disney World performer. “That is a milestone. In my generation, I’m 42, I kept it hidden and I didn’t have the kind of relationship with my family that I would have told them that I was at a gay bar.”

But, he said, “we are not there yet.”

It was Latin night at Pulse on Saturday, which meant that a large number of Latinos — gay and straight — came out to dance salsa and listen to music; most of them were Puerto Rican (a half a million live in the Orlando area) with a sprinkling of Mexicans and Colombians in the mix. While the club advertises as a gay bar and has a large gay clientele, it has always attracted a diverse group.

Orlando has been one of the country’s most gay-friendly cities, with progressive anti-discrimination laws and aggressive advocates in Mayor Buddy Dyer and Patty Sheehan, an openly gay councilwoman. The city hosts gay days every year, huge gatherings that draw people from around the world. Also, local companies like Universal and Disney are gay-friendly. At least one shooting victim was a Disney performer.

Among Latinos, acceptance of gay culture has moved ahead less assertively. An overlay of machista culture remains, making it more difficult to come out for fear of rejection and discrimination.

“Certainly there are pockets of cultural resistance — be it the Hispanic community or the black community,” said Tim Vargas, the president of the board of GLBT Community Center of Central Florida, who is half Mexican. “Both of those have had cultural hindrances to acceptance. I do think we have made a lot of progress.”

Luis Daniel Wilson-Leon, 37, who died at the club, was harassed for being gay as a young man growing up in Puerto Rico, a close friend, Daniel Gmys-Casiano, wrote on Facebook on Monday.

Carlos Guillermo Smith, 35, an Orlando resident who is of Peruvian and French Canadian descent and is government affairs manager for Equality Florida, the statewide gay rights organization, called the massacre inside Pulse an attack on the Latino gay, lesbian and transgender community.

“When you look at the list of names of victims, 90 percent of them are young Latino men,” said Mr. Smith, who is running as a Democrat for an Orlando seat in the State House. “It is so devastating to our community because for me it is so personal, not only because this is my home, it’s my community, it’s against my identity as a gay Latino.”

As relatives waited on Sunday outside a hospital, they spoke lovingly of the young men and women who had been shot and killed, words that bespoke the transformation that has taken place.

Barron Serrano said his brother Juan P. Rivera Velazquez, 37, who loved bodybuilding and karate, had been married to Luis Conde, 39, for 13 years, a partnership he said they had worked hard to nurture. Both were Puerto Rican.

“They had a bumpy relationship, at first; it was not easy and they had ups and down, but they always forgot about their problems and stuck together,” Mr. Serrano said. “They were a very happy couple.”

Al Ferguson, the owner of a travel agency that caters to gay people, said he had kept vigil with families at the hospital in support of his friend Edward Sotomayor Jr., a Puerto Rican man who died in the shooting.

“What struck me in the room is the vast majority of family and friends there were not gay,” said Mr. Ferguson, who is gay. “There were not lots of gay people supporting gay people. There were families that didn’t care they were gay or didn’t care they were in a gay club. They loved their son and their friend. That is a phenomenon that happened in the last six, seven, eight years: public acceptance of the gay community.”",nytimes.com,True

Ted Elliott, a gay college senior from Maine, said he was not jumping to conclusions that the Orlando mass shooting was a hate crime against gay people or an act of terrorism. Mr. Elliott, a self-described liberal, blamed weak gun laws for endless violence.

“Shooting A is the same as Shooting B is the same as Shooting C,” said Mr. Elliott, 21.

Yet for Leonard Faucher, a Donald J. Trump supporter in Houston, the rampage was clearly terrorism.

“All of this is a clash between the cultures,” said Mr. Faucher, 69, referring to Islam and the United States.

The location of the attacks, a popular gay club, proved the killer’s motive to Corrie Yackulic, a lawyer who lives near Seattle.

“It’s an anti-gay bias,” said Ms. Yackulic, 58. “If you’re trying to take down the American government, you don’t attack a gay bar in Orlando.”

Rarely has American reaction to a human tragedy been as divided as the striking and complex array of opinions about the deaths of 49 people in Orlando. While gun violence often cleaves people into predictable, politically identifiable camps, and terrorist attacks tend to unite countries in grief and resolve, Orlando has so far defied easy categorizations and conclusions.

Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, for instance, seized on the attacks on Monday to renew his call for a ban on Muslim immigration, but he also lavished empathy on gay people — many of whom oppose his bid — and defended their desire to “love who they want and express their identity.”

His Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and many party leaders argued that fighting homegrown terrorists required tougher gun laws. Yet some liberals and intellectuals argued that gun control was not the only problem, noting that there were parts of Islam and the Quran hostile to homosexuality.

“The left is very worried about homophobia but it’s also very worried about Islamophobia, so there is going to be some real cognitive dissonance on the left as people talking about a Muslim killing many gay people,” said Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist and professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business.

And many gay people, while agreeing that Orlando was a terrorist attack, said they were offended that some Republican officials have refused to acknowledge that the massacre could be considered a hate crime — or even to use the word “gay” in talking about it. In remarks from the Capitol on Monday, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, condemned the Islamic State as a group that “crucifies children and beheads women” but notably omitted any mention of gays.

In Britain on Sunday, an openly gay journalist stormed off the set of Sky News program, which was founded by Rupert Murdoch, after becoming frustrated that the show’s host was portraying Orlando as an attack on the freedom of all people rather than discussing “it as an attack on L.G.B.T. people.”

The conversations in America and overseas were in stark contrast to the aftermath of the killings of 26 children and staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, when virtually everyone was talking about gun control and mental health. After the attacks last fall in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., the global conversation turned to radicalized Muslims bent on terrorist attacks. And violence against gay, lesbian and transgender people has led to frequent and alarmed discussions among gay people.

No such clarity exists around Orlando, at least for now. As people absorb the dimensions of the attack, it is hard to predict how most Americans will be talking about it in a week or month, let alone around the presidential election in November.

“It’s probably along the lines of all three equally,” said Tina Weidenhammer, 33, of Chicago, a lesbian who has a dog-walking business. She said she and her friends were inspired by the support from family members, but worried that Orlando could have a ripple effect for gay people.

“Our concern is, this is open hunting season if you really wanted to go after gays,” Ms. Weidenhammer, noting the many Gay Pride Month festivals in June. “We are more concentrated and congregating publicly with, literally, our colors.”

In interviews with about 20 Americans across the country on Monday, most said they were still trying to make sense of the attack and viewed it as more complicated than other recent terrorist events. Several also predicted that it would become a defining part of the presidential race. Ioanna Hawk, 41, a schoolteacher and costume designer who lives in Pasadena, Calif., said she was concerned not only that “the access to guns is too much” for potential terrorists and others in America, but also that Orlando would be exploited for political gain.

“One of the first things I thought when it happened was, Trump’s going to use this to get more votes,” she said.

Trump campaign advisers insisted on Monday that the candidate was not trying to use the gunman, Omar Mateen, for political advantage, but attempting to speak bluntly about the ties between recent attacks and Muslim immigration.

And several supporters of Mr. Trump called his comments refreshing because he was willing to highlight radicalized Muslims — rather than speak more generally about terrorism and gun violence. They also praised his comments on Monday noting that gay people, like other Americans, were targets of Muslim terrorists.

“Obviously, the lefties immediately see an opportunity to yell about gun control and somehow think people will believe that gun confiscation will end all this violence,” said Paul Chevalier, a retired officer in the Marines who is active in Republican politics in New Hampshire. “Obama refuses to link any of this terrorism to Islam or even ‘radical Islam,’ so I think most Americans are beginning to think that Trump is our best hope for ever defeating this scourge on the world.”

Deirdre McCloskey, a transgender woman who is an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said she shuddered at the thought of Mr. Trump gaining mileage as a result of the shooting.

“I take Orlando as terrorism, that is, violence for a political purpose. It especially disturbs me as a citizen of a democracy, not as a queer. That is why The Donald’s immediate use of the fears it arouses to further his plans for fascist-leaning populism alarms me,” she said. “It can happen here.”

The breadth of reactions did not surprise some experts in human behavior. Professor Haidt noted studies showing that people’s reaction to scientific evidence was very different depending on whether they saw the policy implications of the science as politically desirable.

“So when we hear news reports, we don’t decide what happened and then decide what to do about it,” he said. “Rather, we know what we want to do, and we interpret what happened in the way that will best help us do what we want to do.”",nytimes.com,True

Will that change now?

Murderous attacks on gay establishments are not new, of course. Arson at a gay lounge in New Orleans in 1973 killed 32 people, a number that was surpassed on Sunday in Orlando. Smaller-scale attacks have occurred at bars across the country.

They are shocks, every time, precisely because these spaces exist to shelter their inhabitants from the slights and sallies of the world.

It is no accident that a major turning point in the modern gay-rights movement took place at a gay bar. The Stonewall Inn, in Manhattan’s West Village, was a refuge in a city where bars frequently refused to welcome gay men, lesbians and transgender patrons. When the police raided it in 1969, the gay community rebelled. This was their sanctuary.

On Sunday night, in front of the Stonewall Inn, I met a 52-year-old gay activist, David Drake. Older and wiser than me (I’m now 36), he described the outrage he felt about the Orlando gunman’s decision to carry out his massacre at a gay nightclub. His frame of reference was telling.

“It’s like when the gunman goes into a church and shoots people,” he said. “This is completely wrong.”

“It’s sacred,” he said of the bar behind him, draped in rainbow-colored flags. “These spaces, even though they are quote-unquote ‘bars or clubs,’ are those spaces for people in the L.G.B.T.Q. community. Those are the spaces we come to.”

He spoke of the thousands of young gay, bisexual and transgender people who flock to bars and clubs in the West Village: “Night after night after night, these kids come down here because they feel like it’s their safe space. The queer kids from various colors, various communities come here because it’s their space. They can be who they want, they can be who they are to themselves and each other, to reflect each other, to know each other, to love each other, to discover each other, to grow with each other, in order to become grown-up people.”

The gunman who killed 49 people inside Pulse may have wanted to rob gay bars of that hard-fought role, but he did not. He could not.",nytimes.com,True

But that connectedness also meant that Orlando quickly became politicized globally as well as in the United States. One organization campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union in the June 23 national referendum posted a campaign message on Twitter that showed Islamic State fighters warning of an “Orlando-style atrocity” if Britain remained in the European bloc. The group deleted the message after the person who posted it was widely condemned.

For many gays, lesbians and transgender people, the Orlando attack was a searing moment, highlighting the continued threats they face from an ideologically varied array of sources even as much of the world grows more inclusive about sexuality.

In London, Owen Jones, a liberal columnist who is gay, walked off the set of a Sky News program after arguing with the host on how the Orlando attack should be defined. Mr. Jones argued it was both a terrorist attack and an anti-gay hate crime, while the program’s host sought to make a distinction between the two.

“This guy, however he dresses up his bigotry and hatred, is someone who hates gays,” Mr. Jones said of the killer. “If he went into a synagogue and killed innocent Jewish people, as people have done, disgusting anti-Semitic terrorists, we’d call it out for what it is.

“This was a homophobic hate crime as well as terrorism.”

The day before the Orlando attack, thousands of people took part in gay pride parades in Croatia and Poland amid concerns about rising right-wing political trends. In Brazil, a spate of killings of gay and transgender people has started an intense debate, with some Brazilians arguing that the rising clout of evangelical Christian legislators is increasing intolerance in the country.

“These killings in Orlando were motivated by the most sordid homophobia,” said Jean Wyllys, an openly gay congressman from Rio de Janeiro.

“This could have happened to any of us, to me, to a friend, a work colleague, a neighbor, a cousin. They could be dead if they had been in Orlando enjoying themselves at a club without harming anyone else.”

Europe’s mainstream political leaders were quick to offer condolences on Monday and affirm their friendship with the American people. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany condemned “such a murderous attack” and declared a determination to “continue our open, tolerant life.”

Tel Aviv’s City Hall was bathed in the colors of the rainbow and the American flag on Sunday night. The town hall in Sydney, Australia, was lit in pink.

Even so, the Orlando killings come as far-right political parties in Europe are stoking anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim sentiments in a similar vein to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in the United States. As Mr. Trump quickly seized on the massacre to renew his call to view Muslim immigrants as a threat, some politicians in the European right did the same.

Hungary’s right-wing government has been in the vanguard on resisting migrants, and championing a so-called illiberal democracy. On Monday, Lajos Kosa, the parliamentary leader of the governing party, invoked the Orlando attacks as a cudgel to repeat the party’s campaign against migrants from Syria and other Muslim nations.

“Uncontrolled migration, forced resettlement, the inflow of crowds into European society who not only cannot but do not want to integrate come with enormous dangers,” Mr. Kosa told a plenary session of the Hungarian Parliament on Monday.

In recent years, as Europe has struggled to respond to Islamist terrorism, security in the United States was regarded as more efficient and better organized. Europe’s national security agencies were poorly coordinated and blamed for failing to root out cells of homegrown Islamist terrorists, especially in France and Belgium.

Now, after the attacks in Orlando and San Bernardino, Calif., the United States also seems likely to confront difficult questions about the government’s ability to track and stop determined killers, especially those who operate largely on their own, drawing inspiration but not practical support from groups like the Islamic State. The questions are likely to be especially pointed for the F.B.I., given that it had twice investigated the Orlando killer, Omar Mateen, for possible terrorist ties.

In China, news of the Orlando shooting came only hours after a man set off primitive explosives in the check-in area at an airport in Shanghai. Four people were slightly injured, showing the gulf between the two countries in the lethality of the weapons available to the public. In China, where ordinary citizens have no access to firearms, the weapon of choice is often a large kitchen knife.

More than 300,000 Chinese students are studying at American universities, and the Orlando shooting brought on new concerns from Chinese parents. Gao Junlan, a lawyer from southwestern China’s Sichuan Province, was concerned about her daughter, a third-year chemistry student at the University of Minnesota. Her daughter was at the Shanghai airport when the explosives were detonated there, waiting to catch a flight to the United States.

“I think the American government should tighten its gun control,” Ms. Gao said by telephone. “Yes, it is a free society for people with all religions and beliefs, but not everyone is capable of controlling their behavior, and the government’s lax regulation is making killing a lot easier.”",nytimes.com,True

The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community is no stranger to violence.

From the 1969 police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York City that set off riots and helped touch off the modern gay-rights movement to the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard to near-epidemic levels of violence against transgender women, the community has been marked by flashes of trauma.

After the massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Fla., that left 49 dead and 53 others injured, Richard Kim, the executive editor of The Nation, wrote on Sunday that gay bars and clubs have often been sanctuaries. And sometimes those sanctuaries have come under siege.

Here are a few significant examples.

New Orleans, 1973

Thirty-two people died when a fire swept through the UpStairs Lounge, a gay bar in the French Quarter, on June 24, 1973. After the blaze, some churches refused to bury the victims. The arsonist was never caught.

Video

“It was horrible,” Arthur Lambert, a firefighter who responded to the blaze, said in a video interview in 2013. “These people, they were literally roasted alive.”

The New Orleans Times-Picayune wrote in 2013 that the lounge was “not just any bar, but as a gay community hangout where locals could gather without fear of social persecution” at a time of intense anti-gay stigma.

Atlanta, 1997

Five people were injured when a bomb exploded at a lesbian bar, the Otherside Lounge, in February 1997. A second, unexploded, bomb was later found outside.

Video

It was one of four attacks by Eric Rudolph, a right-wing extremist, who also bombed two abortion clinics and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where one person died and 111 more were injured. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2005.

Mr. Rudolph (who has a gay brother) said in a statement during his sentencing that he did not mind homosexuality that remained private. But he said any attempt to “drag this practice out of the closet” and have society accept it “should be ruthlessly opposed.”

Virginia, 2000

A former Marine shot and killed Danny Overstreet, 43, and injured six others in the Backstreet Cafe in Roanoke, Va., in 2000. The gunman, Ronald Edward Gay, 53, opened fire when he saw two men in the bar hug each other.

“When it happened, I was not out to my family,” Joel Tucker, who was shot in the back during the rampage, told The Washington Post last year. “I was not out to my job. I wasn’t out to anybody except my very close friends.”

Mr. Gay, who told the police he was on a mission to kill gay people, said he was upset that his last name had made him the target of anti-gay jokes. He was sentenced to four life terms in 2001.

Seattle, 2014

Musab Mohammed Masmari, 30, poured gasoline on the stairs of a gay club and set it alight shortly after midnight on New Year’s Eve. More than 700 people were in the club at the time, including much of the city’s gay and transgender leadership, but no one was hurt.

Mr. Masmari pleaded guilty to arson and was sentenced to 10 years in prison in July 2014. He told the court that he could not remember setting the fire because he had blacked out after drinking an entire bottle of whiskey.

Stonewall Inn, 2010 and 2016

The Stonewall Inn played a central role in the modern gay rights movement, but it has also seen antigay and anti-transgender violence in recent years.

Two men attacked another man in the restroom in 2010 after he informed them that they were in a gay bar. The assailants were arrested, and one was later charged with hate crimes.

“The reality is, if people are looking to perpetrate anti-gay bias and violence, there are very few places in this world that are safe once that intent has formed,” Sharon Stapel, the former executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project, said at the time of the attack.

In March this year, a transgender woman said she was sexually assaulted in the unisex restroom.",nytimes.com,True

In my dreams, that is the beginning of another great story of remix, tolerance and coexistence that is possible only in America. In reality, it’s the start of a nightmare massacre fueled by hatred and perpetrated by a man from a group already scarred by a generation of suspicion and surveillance.

Whether Omar Mateen was a militant fighter financed by the Islamic State, a self-radicalized extremist or a lone wolf psychopath with a gun license, the distinction for committing the worst mass shooting in our history now belongs to an American Muslim.

After the attacks in Orlando early Sunday morning, many of my American Muslim friends began posting messages on Facebook about how frustrating it felt to go from the affirming images of the late Muhammad Ali to news of yet another terrorist attack. “He doesn’t represent us,” many wrote. “He can’t call himself a Muslim.” For many American Muslims, this kind of immediate condemnation and social media activism has become the first step in our symbiotic relationship with the news cycle. As the history of fellow minorities has taught us, retaliatory violence, exclusion and even internment are always possible in the American family and it’s best to try to get ahead of the curve.

But in this moment of hashtag solidarity, I hope we can also have some tough conversations about our limits. Accompanying those posts, I saw many gestures of solidarity and sympathy for the L.G.B.T. community. But behind those posts is a history of silence on gay rights.

Arsonists set fire to gay churches in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Nashville and San Francisco in 1973 and 1974. Six months before the fire at the UpStairs Lounge, on Jan. 27, 1973, a fire broke out at the “Mother Church” of the M.C.C., in Los Angeles, where a gay Jewish group met for services.

Though no other attack came close to the death toll at the UpStairs Lounge, the attacks collectively set off an undercurrent of fear among the L.G.B.T. community in the 1970s: that our bars, which have been the sites of our political liberation, the focal point of our community, and even our places of worship, have also been the visible targets of violence and hatred committed against us.

That fear has subsided somewhat over the last generation, to the point where for many gays, something like the Orlando shooting might have seemed almost unthinkable, until it happened. But instead, it is a reminder that anti-gay violence has never been about individual acts against individuals, but an attack against the very idea that L.G.B.T. people should be free to express and enjoy themselves in public.

In the coming weeks, the news media will likely center on the culprit and his motivations in Orlando. This happened in New Orleans as well in 1973. The police and fire department spent months investigating the case, interviewing the survivors and even flying across the country to California to arrest a suspect. The emphasis on the culprit unwittingly overshadowed the story of the victims. And yet over 40 years later, no one has ever been charged for the arson, and the history of those who died in the fire soon became forgotten.

As it becomes increasingly likely that Omar Mateen, the suspected gunman in Orlando, was motivated by an extremist ideology, we likewise run the risk of forgetting the L.G.B.T. victims of this most recent attack as well. Some may have not been out to their families and their sexual orientation will be revealed to them only in the morgue. Others fell dead next to a friend or a stranger. Others likely went to the Pulse nightclub alone and found hope in the promise of a gay bar on a Saturday night, where they might find a friend and a community to call their own.

Fortunately, the anti-gay attacks of the 1970s did not prevent L.G.B.T. people from meeting and marching, nor did it stop them from gathering at bars and clubs to enjoy themselves. There was too much at stake. We can only hope that the same thing happens today, and that we remember that, despite progress, there is still much at stake. The sites of our liberation must not become the targets of our oppression.",nytimes.com,True

ORLANDO, Fla. — A man who called 911 to proclaim allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist group, and who had been investigated in the past for possible terrorist ties, stormed a gay nightclub here Sunday morning, wielding an assault rifle and a pistol, and carried out the worst mass shooting in United States history, leaving 50 people dead and 53 wounded.

The attacker, identified by law enforcement officials as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old who was born in New York, turned what had been a celebratory night of dancing to salsa and merengue music at the crowded Pulse nightclub into a panicked scene of unimaginable slaughter, the floors slicked with blood, the dead and the injured piled atop one another. Terrified people poured onto the darkened streets of the surrounding neighborhood, some carried wounded victims to safety, and police vehicles were pressed into service as makeshift ambulances to rush people to hospitals.

Joel Figueroa and his friends “were dancing by the hip-hop area when I heard shots, bam, bam, bam,” he said, adding, “Everybody was screaming and running toward the front door.”

Video

Pulse, which calls itself “Orlando’s Latin Hotspot,” was holding its weekly “Upscale Latin Saturdays” party. The shooting began around 2 a.m., and some patrons thought at first that the booming reports they heard were firecrackers or part of the loud, thumping dance music.

Some people who were trapped inside hid where they could, calling 911 or posting messages to social media, pleading for help. The club posted a stark message on its Facebook page: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.”

Hundreds of people gathered in the glare of flashing red lights on the fringes of the law enforcement cordon around the nightclub, and later at area hospitals, hoping desperately for some word on the fates of their relatives and friends.

More than 12 hours after the attack, anguished relatives paced between Orlando Regional Medical Center and a nearby hotel as they waited for word. They were told that so many were gunned down that victims would be tagged as anonymous until the hospital was able to identify them.

“We are here suffering, knowing nothing,” said Baron Serrano, whose brother, Juan Rivera, 36, had been celebrating a friend’s birthday with his husband and was now unaccounted for. “I cannot understand why they can’t tell me anything because my brother is a very well-known person here in Orlando. He is a hairstylist, and everybody knows him.”

A tally of victims whose relatives had been notified began slowly building on a city website; by 6 p.m., it had six names. Among them was Juan Ramon Guerrero, a 22-year-old man of Dominican descent who had gone to the club with his boyfriend, Christopher Leinonen, who goes by the name Drew, because they wanted to listen to salsa. A friend, Brandon Wolf, watched people carry Mr. Guerrero outside, his body riddled with gunshot wounds.

But no one knew what had become of Mr. Leinonen. His mother, Christine, anxious because of health problems, had woken at 3 a.m. to news of the shooting, and learned from Mr. Wolf that her son had been inside.

A three-hour standoff followed the initial assault, with people inside effectively held hostage until around 5 a.m., when law enforcement officials led by a SWAT team raided the club, using an armored vehicle and explosives designed to disorient and distract. Over a dozen police officers and sheriff’s deputies engaged in a shootout with Mr. Mateen, leaving him dead and an officer wounded, his life saved by a Kevlar helmet that deflected a bullet.

At least 30 people inside were rescued, and even the hardened police veterans who took the building and combed through it, aiding the living and identifying the dead, were shaken by what they saw, said John Mina, the Orlando police chief. “Just to look into the eyes of our officers told the whole story,” he said.

It was the worst act of terrorism on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001, and the deadliest attack on a gay target in the nation’s history, though officials said it was not clear whether some victims had been accidentally shot by law enforcement officers.

The toll of 50 dead is larger than the number of murders in Orlando over the previous three years. Of an estimated 320 people in the club, nearly one-third were shot. The casualties far exceeded those in the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech, where 32 people were killed, and the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., where 26 people died.

“In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,” President Obama said in a special address from the White House. “We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united as Americans to protect our people and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.”

As he had done after several previous mass shootings, the president said the shooting demonstrated the need for what he called “common-sense” gun measures.

“This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or a house of worship or a movie theater or a nightclub,” Mr. Obama said. “We have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. To actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

The shooting quickly made its way into the presidential campaign. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who has accused Mr. Obama of weakness on radical Islam and has called for barring Muslim immigrants, suggested on Twitter that the president should resign.

“Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism,” he wrote. “I don’t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!”

Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, released a statement saying: “We need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home.”

Fears of violence led to heightened security at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender events and gathering places around the country. Law enforcement officials in Santa Monica, Calif., confirmed the arrest on Sunday of a heavily armed man who said he was in the area for West Hollywood’s gay pride parade. The authorities, however, said they did not know of any connection between the California arrest and the Orlando shooting.

The F.B.I. investigated Mr. Mateen in 2013 when he made comments to co-workers suggesting he had terrorist ties, and again the next year, for possible connections to Moner Mohammad Abusalha, an American who became a suicide bomber in Syria, said Ronald Hopper, an assistant agent in charge of the bureau’s Tampa Division. But each time, the F.B.I. found no solid evidence that Mr. Mateen had any real connection to terrorism or had broken any laws. Still, he is believed to be on at least one watch list.

Mr. Mateen, who lived in Fort Pierce, Fla., was able to continue working as a security guard with the security firm G4S, where he had worked since 2007, and he was able to buy guns. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Mr. Mateen had legally bought a long gun and a pistol in the past week or two, though it was not clear whether those were the weapons used in the assault, which officials described as a handgun and an AR-15 type of assault rifle.

A former co-worker, Daniel Gilroy, said Mr. Mateen had talked often about killing people and had voiced hatred of gays, blacks, women and Jews.

Around the time of the massacre, Mr. Mateen called 911 and declared his allegiance to the Islamic State, the brutal group that has taken over parts of Syria, Iraq and Libya, Agent Hopper said. Other law enforcement officials said he called after beginning his assault.

Hours later, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed responsibility in a statement released over an encrypted phone app used by the group. It stated that the attack “was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,” according to a transcript provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist propaganda.

But officials cautioned that even if Mr. Mateen, who court records show was briefly married and then divorced, was inspired by the group, there was no indication that it had trained or instructed him, or had any direct connection with him. Some other terrorist attackers have been “self-radicalized,” including the pair who killed 14 people in December in San Bernardino, Calif., who also proclaimed allegiance to the Islamic State, but apparently had no contact with the group.

The Islamic State has encouraged “lone wolf” attacks in the West, a point reinforced recently by a group spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, in his annual speech just before the holy month of Ramadan. In past years, the Islamic State and Al Qaeda ramped up attacks during Ramadan.

American Muslim groups condemned the shooting. “The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence,” said Rasha Mubarak, the Orlando regional coordinator of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.",nytimes.com,True

The police said the gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, an American citizen whose parents were from Afghanistan, had twice been investigated on suspicions of terrorism. As President Obama called the shooting an “act of terror and an act of hate,” Mr. Mateen’s father told NBC News that his son had been angry when he saw two men kissing. The East Orlando Post reported that Mr. Mateen had researched at least one other gay club in Orlando before attacking Pulse.

Almost a year after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans, and those working to advance their rights, spent Sunday grappling with the implications — at gay pride celebrations, in their homes, at candlelight vigils. Particularly awful was that the massacre had transformed what was once seen as a haven for gay people — a gay bar — into a death chamber.

In Los Angeles, the fear took on particular urgency when the police reported that they had arrested a man with weapons and explosives who was headed to the city’s gay pride parade.

In Florence, Ala., where Mr. Newbern lives, he said the attacks had compounded “all that anxiety about being L.G.B.T. in the Deep South.” In Washington, David Thompson, 49, woke up to three lengthy text messages from his 70-year-old mother.

“On the one hand, how can you not help but feel nervous?” Ms. Bonauto said. But on the other hand, she expressed worry about Islamophobia. “I was thinking, ‘Should I wear a T-shirt that says, ‘Don’t judge the many by the few’ — something to show some solidarity?” she said.

The gay rights movement, of course, is no stranger to the fear of violence. That includes the days when gay people worried about being branded “faggots” and beaten, whether in small towns or in gay centers like New York; the 1973 arson attack on a gay bar in New Orleans that left 32 people dead; the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard. All are cultural touchstones for the community.

In 2015, the F.B.I. reported that 18.6 percent of the 5,462 so-called single-bias hate crimes the previous year were attributable to sexual orientation; 47 percent were attributable to race. But Jay Brown, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, said that hate crimes against gay people were underreported, and that finding accurate statistics was “extremely challenging.”

Movement leaders, speaking anecdotally, said they sensed an increase in violence against gay people this year — perhaps, some said, because of the divisive presidential campaign, or because of high-profile policy fights like the one over the Obama administration’s recent directive requiring schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice.

“I sincerely believe that this is following a trend, that we often see an uptick during presidential elections — particularly when the vitriol increases about our community,” said Lorri L.

Officials at the Human Rights Campaign said they had been struck by a recent spate of highly publicized assaults against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.

In Los Angeles, also in March, a gay man was murdered by his father; amid debate over what role the victim’s sexual orientation played, Ms. Jean said, his sisters asked the Los Angeles L.G.B.T. Center for help “because they feel that their father was really upset that this kid was gay, and that this was nothing but an anti-gay hate crime.”

On Sunday, gay rights activists around the country were trying to figure out how to move forward. In Jasper, Fla., about two and a half hours north of Orlando, Art Smith, a onetime personal chef to Oprah Winfrey, said he hoped to host a benefit for the victims’ families.

Mr. Newbern is planning a memorial in Florence on Monday night. The gay pride dance this weekend was to be the first in a series of events, including a panel discussion and an interfaith service at the local Unitarian church. Now, the service will be a candlelight vigil to honor the dead.

“I don’t want to rush to judgment about what the motivation was here — if it was extremism, if it was specifically L.G.B.T. hate,” he said. “It doesn’t change the fact that those 50 souls, and now probably more, are gone.”

The events that led to Major Langford’s arrest began Thursday afternoon when he insulted a mosque member doing construction work near the mosque and then left packages of bacon at the mosque entrance, according to the authorities and witnesses.

Advocacy groups say pork is often used to insult Muslims, whose religion does not allow them to eat it. The Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations said the act constituted a desecration of the place of worship.

Witnesses say the suspect left and returned to the Masjid Al Madina mosque several times in his truck, prompting tense moments inside while children were sheltered in the back of the building. The authorities said there were no injuries.

At one point, the suspect followed one member home, resulting in the stalking charge, according to a news release from the sheriff’s office. The mosque member tried to evade him but could not.

The alleged threats came during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations asked the authorities to investigate the case as a possible hate crime and to increase patrols around the area, especially during nighttime Ramadan activities.

Before midday prayers on Friday, a patrol car was parked outside the mosque just off a state highway between Fayetteville and Raeford.

The mosque has been there for about three decades.

“We’ve never had a problem with anyone,” said Kamal Allan of Raeford, who said he was confronted at the construction site near the mosque.

Mr. Allan, a general contractor and mosque member, said he was leading a crew tearing down a nearby outbuilding when a man drove up in the late afternoon. Mr. Allan said the man began insulting him and using profanity while asking white crew members, “Do you know who you’re working for?”

“I said: ‘Don’t talk to him. Don’t talk to him. Just leave him alone and let the police handle it,’” Mr. Allan said.

Mohammed Khan, a retired Army officer who served three decades in the military, said he was delivering tables to the mosque when the man drove up. He said he spoke calmly to the man, who spoke angrily and eventually flashed a gun at him.

“I was kind of dismayed, shocked and in disbelief,” said Mr. Khan, who still serves as a volunteer Muslim chaplain at Fort Bragg.

“He told me to go back to my country. I said, ‘Which country do you want me to go to? Give me the ticket and I will fly.’ He said, ‘No, I will not give you a ticket. I will kill you and bury your body right there.’”

Mr. Khan said the man followed another member of the mosque to that person’s home.

Abdu Alsaidi, another mosque member who said he was one of the witnesses, said the police were called in the late afternoon, but Major Langford was not arrested until sometime after 8 p.m.

At one point, while the man was parked in front of the mosque, Mr. Alsaidi said adult members made children move to the back of the building out of fear of an attack.

DHAKA, Bangladesh — A Hindu priest was hacked to death on Tuesday morning in southwestern Bangladesh in what the police suspect is the latest in a series of killings by Islamist militants.

The priest, Anando Gopal Ganguly, 68, was riding a bicycle in an isolated rural area not far from his home when he was attacked by three men on a motorcycle who came up from behind him, said Gopinath Kanjilal, an assistant superintendent of the police for the Jhenaidah district. He said Mr. Ganguly had been on his way to conduct a prayer service.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the murder in a report by the group’s Amaq news agency, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online.

“It seems the attackers were following the priest from his home and killed him at a convenient place,” Mr. Kanjilal said. Mr. Ganguly’s throat was slit, and he was “almost beheaded,” said Mr. Kanjilal, who said he had suspected that Islamist militants were responsible.

In recent years, Bangladesh has had a series of similar killings.

The Daily News report included statements from Diane Fatigati, 53, a retired police officer, who witnessed part of the encounter and rendered aid to the dying teenager. In the article, and again to reporters on Friday, she said she had heard the group of white teenagers using the slur to taunt Mr. McKenzie, 16, and his friends, all of them black.

But the police said that Ms. Fatigati had not mentioned the slur to investigators until they interviewed her a second time on Thursday. The police had also interviewed six people involved in the conflict, and none of them said they had heard the slur, Chief Boyce said.

Ms. Fatigati said in an interview that she had told the police about hearing the slur on the night Mr. McKenzie died. Investigators had planned to interview her a third time on Friday at the 121st Precinct station.

Surveillance video shows Mr. McKenzie approaching two people engaged in a dispute, Chief Boyce said. One of them had thrown a punch at the other before Mr. McKenzie stepped into the fray, he said.

“Mr. McKenzie rolled up to the location in support of a friend,” he said.

The dispute traveled a few blocks to Spartan Avenue, where, Ms. Fatigati said, she was sitting outside her home when she saw the commotion on the street. She described seeing six to eight young white men and a Hispanic man chasing three young black men up the street. One of the men in the larger group stopped and grabbed his crotch, yelling the name of a gang and the racial slur at the smaller group, she said.

Ms. Fatigati said her sister called the police while she rushed down the street to get her 11-year-old niece out of potential danger. At the corner of Spartan Avenue and Rosecliff Road, Ms. Fatigati said, she saw the white group slapping one of the black youths about his head.

Members of the larger group dispersed moments later after hearing a police siren, according to Ms. Fatigati, and sped away in cars.

The medical examiner’s office said it was conducting further tests to determine the cause and manner of Mr. McKenzie’s death.

Ms. Richardson said her son was an aspiring rapper who played basketball and kept a tight circle of friends. But she feared for his life, especially on hot days, when he could suffer as many as three asthma attacks.

Johnson Sr., president of the Louisiana branch of the N.A.A.C.P., countered, saying, “Hate crimes law is based upon a history of discrimination against certain groups of people, and a bill like this just tries to water down that reality, because there is not a history of discrimination against police and firefighters.”

Mr. Edwards, a Democrat whose family ties to law enforcement are broad and deep, said: “The men and women who put their lives on the line every day, often under very dangerous circumstances, are true heroes and they deserve every protection that we can give them.” Mr. Edwards’s brother, Daniel, is the sheriff in Tangipahoa Parish; another brother, Frank, is the police chief of Independence, a town in the parish; and their father, grandfather and great-great-grandfather were also sheriffs in Tangipahoa.

William J. Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, an alliance of officers’ unions, lauded the bill. “I think it’s fair to say that officers are under attack nationwide, and this is a reasonable response,” he said.

But violence against police officers is near an all-time low, according to data kept by the F.B.I. and private groups. In recent years, homicides have been less than half what they were in the 1970s, when there were far fewer officers. In 2015, 41 officers on duty were “feloniously killed,” a category that excludes accidental deaths, the second-lowest figure in the last 60 years; the lowest was in 2014.

So far this year, 20 officers have been fatally shot while on duty, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. That is up from 16 at the same point last year, but it is a pace that would still make 2016 one of the least deadly years on record.

Mr. Harris, Mr. Johnson and others have cited two fatal episodes. Last August, Darren H. Goforth, a sheriff’s deputy in Harris County, Tex., was shot to death as he was getting gas for his patrol car; and in December 2014, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, New York City police officers, were shot to death as they sat in a patrol car in Brooklyn.

In both cases, law enforcement officials attributed the killings to hatred of the police. The leader of a police union in New York blamed Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had voiced sympathy for protests against police killings, for the shooting there. The Harris County sheriff, Ron Hickman, said anti-law-enforcement speech, which he linked to Black Lives Matter, had promoted the killing of officers, a statement he later said he regretted, though he said he still believed Deputy Goforth had been targeted.

The assailant in New York had made it clear that he intended to kill officers in retaliation for the killings of black men, but in the Texas case, officials have not said what evidence they have about a motive. Both gunmen had histories of severe mental illness.

“Perception matters, and low-frequency, high-impact events drive perception,” whether that means viral video of a shooting by an officer or violence against an officer, said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, a national group that researches and advises law enforcement. “Police officers believe that the odds have increased that they will be assaulted and ambushed and attacked, even though the numbers may not support that.”

Louisiana, like many states, already had a law that increased penalties for crimes committed against emergency responders. The hate crimes statute, which is separate, provides that up to five more years can be added to the prison sentence of a person who is convicted of a felony if the court finds that the victim was chosen based on prejudice against certain groups.

Mr. Harris noted that among the criteria already in the law were “membership or service in, or employment with, an organization.” That meant, he said, that adding law enforcement officers and firefighters simply makes explicit what was already implied.

The Louisiana bill caused few ripples until it was close to becoming law; some of the groups now lined up in favor and against it were not aware of it until a few days ago. It passed Louisiana’s Republican-controlled House 92 to 0. In the Republican-controlled Senate, it passed 33 to 3. Mr. Harris said he never expected it to draw much attention, but this week he said he had fielded calls from around the country.

Allison Padilla-Goodman, director of the Anti-Defamation League for the region that includes Louisiana, said hate crime laws originated because offenses motivated by bias were often brushed off, but “there is zero confusion that a crime against a cop gets treated very seriously.”

She added, “Hate crimes are about an identity-based bias, an immutable characteristic that a person cannot change. Adding a professional category changes and confuses the meaning of that.”

Mr. Bueermann, a former police chief of Redlands, Calif., said that covering officers under hate crimes laws “can reinforce the notion that hatred of a group because of who they are has no place in our society, which is good,” but it should be coupled with holding officers to higher standards of conduct.

He cautioned that the law’s supporters had opened a new debate that could go in directions they might not like.

In the past, courts and human rights tribunals in Canada have generally decided to hear cases involving transgender people, but they did so on the basis of broad provisions in existing law prohibiting discrimination based on sex, said Brenda Cossman, a law professor at the University of Toronto and the director of its Mark S. Bonham Center for Sexual Diversity Studies.

“This just makes that crystal clear,” Professor Cossman said, adding that she believed it was nevertheless a significant step.

The government’s proposals include changes to both the federal criminal code and the Canadian Human Rights Act. The changes to the criminal code will have a broader impact, because criminal law is solely a federal responsibility in Canada, while each province has its own human rights charter.

Current law makes it a crime to make “hate propaganda” against members of specific groups; the proposed legislation would add transgender people to the list. It would also oblige judges to consider in sentencing decisions whether crimes were caused by or aggravated because of discrimination against transgender people.

Though the federal human rights act applies only to citizens’ interactions with the federal government or with federally regulated industries like airlines and phone companies, Professor Cossman said that the proposed revisions would still bring significant changes, and that the federal government was “leading by example.”

Canada’s House of Commons has twice passed similar legislation during the previous Conservative government, but objections from Conservatives in the country’s appointed Senate stalled the bills until they died when the parliamentary sessions ended.

The new legislation is expected to have an easier time. The earlier bills were proposed by members of the opposition New Democratic Party, but the Senate has traditionally been reluctant to stall bills the government proposes. If it does so, the government has more resources to overcome roadblocks than opposition members of Parliament do.

Alexandre Baril, an assistant professor at the University of Ottawa’s institute of feminist and gender studies, said the new bills were welcome but insufficient on their own. “We cannot count on legal reforms to protect transgender people,” Mr. Baril said. “It will be a first step, but after that, there are so many things we need to focus on.”

Among other things, he said, there was still an acute need to improve health support, particularly for mental health needs, for transgender people in Canada.",nytimes.com,True

Last year, unidentified men used machetes to attack four activists who published views critical of Sunni Islam, and two publishers who had published their works. The attacks took place in broad daylight, on crowded city streets, or in the victims’ homes.

Since those attacks, extremists appeared to broaden their list of targets to include new categories of minorities. Shiite Muslims, Hindu priests and Christian priests were attacked, and two foreigners were shot, apparently at random. The killings resumed this month, with the hacking death of a student activist in Dhaka and the killing of the university professor.

Federal officials and the local police are investigating burglaries and hate literature that appear to be directed at Muslim students attending Idaho State University in Pocatello, where tensions have recently risen over an influx of students from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

In an email to Idaho State faculty and students Wednesday, the university’s president, Arthur C. Vailas, said the homes of about 50 Middle Eastern students had been burglarized over the past several weeks. “As a result of these crimes, some of our students are seriously considering leaving I.S.U. and Pocatello,” the email said.

The burglaries follow reports that 17 vehicles, many belonging to Middle Eastern students, were vandalized last year, Mr. Vailas’s email said. More recently, DVDs containing hate messages were left on a number of car windshields on campus.

The Pocatello police chief, Scott Marchand, said that his office was investigating the burglaries but had received reports of about two dozen, not 50. He also said there had been about 70 residential burglaries in town since Jan. 1.",nytimes.com,True

The sentencing of Elliot Morales, who was convicted last month of murder as a hate crime after shooting a gay man in the West Village, was delayed on Monday, as the defense requested additional time to review a series of issues surrounding the case.

The delay comes as the defense prepares for the prosecution to treat Mr. Morales as a so-called violent predicate felony offender, based on a previous conviction for an armed robbery. Mr. Morales served 11 years in prison for that offense, in which three women were bound with duct tape, choked and assaulted with a pipe.

Murder as a hate crime carries a minimum sentence of 20 years to life, five years more than a second-degree murder conviction. Violent predicate felony offender status would add to his sentence.

Mr. Morales, who is serving as his own lawyer in the case, also requested a chance to review a series of trial transcripts after he said he had found a number of misprints.

In March, after a tempestuous two-week trial followed by two days of deliberation, jurors found Mr. Morales guilty of shooting Mark Carson to death on a West Village street in 2013, after first yelling anti-gay slurs at him and a friend, Danny Robinson.

The ruling started a social media uproar, with fans and female artists, including Taylor Swift and Adele, adopting the #FreeKesha cause.

Kesha’s legal team appealed the ruling in March, likening her recording contract with Dr. Luke and Sony to “slavery.”

On Wednesday, Justice Kornreich said that while Kesha claimed she was “sexually, physically and verbally abused by Gottwald for a decade, she describes only two specific instances.” And while the singer said the abuse continued after those alleged episodes in 2005 and 2008, the judge said, “she supplies no dates or specifics.” (No criminal charges have been filed against Dr. Luke.)

In response to Kesha’s claim that Sony knew of and enabled abuse, the judge wrote, “She failed to make the necessary allegations.” Sony declined to comment on the ruling.

Justice Kornreich also rejected Kesha’s allegations that she was the victim of a hate crime. “Although Gottwald’s alleged actions were directed to Kesha, who is female,” the judge said, the claims “do not allege that Gottwald harbored animus toward women or was motivated by gender animus when he allegedly behaved violently toward Kesha.”

“Every rape is not a gender-motivated hate crime,” she wrote.

Lawyers for Kesha and Dr. Luke did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Sunday, Kesha said in an Instagram post that she had been offered a release from her contract if she recanted her rape claims. “I will not take back the TRUTH,” she wrote. “I would rather let the truth ruin my career than lie for a monster ever again.”

Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives for the New York Police Department, said the woman, a 20-year-old student from Egypt, would not face criminal charges because she had emotional issues. The woman, who admitted to the authorities that she had cut herself, was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center for a psychiatric evaluation, the police said.

The woman, whose name was not released, initially told investigators that she was leaving a school she attends at 65 Broadway in the financial district around 4:20 p.m. on Thursday when a white man grabbed her from behind, spun her around and slashed her across the face, the police said. But investigators found evidence that contradicted her story, and she recanted.

The authorities said surveillance video from the area showed that she had not left the building before calling the police, and Chief Boyce said investigators found blood in a bathroom on the 15th floor. The Make-up Designory, where the woman is studying cosmetology, is on the same floor.

On Friday, Chief Boyce said, a 64-year-old man on his way to work was slashed at 4:30 a.m. after getting off the A train at Chambers Street in Manhattan. His assailant had demanded money, and when the victim said he did not have any, he was slashed from behind, the police said.

Around 3 p.m. on Friday, a 51-year-old man was slashed in the back at Pennsylvania Station. The police said two people who may have been panhandlers got money from the victim and then attacked him after he refused to give them more. No arrests had been made as of Friday evening.",nytimes.com,True

In many ways, it led to numerous other victories.”

That includes the establishment of the neighborhood gay pride parade and a political club that helped push for same-sex marriage in recent years, all of which are featured in “Julio of Jackson Heights,” a documentary by Richard Shpuntoff that had its premiere last week at the Queens World Film Festival.

Mr. Shpuntoff grew up in the area and volunteered to photograph Jackson Heights’ first pride parade in 1993, something he would continue to do for 20 years. He decided to make the documentary as a way to highlight the changes that have swept over the neighborhood since Mr. Rivera’s murder. It is a measure of progress that people at the parade almost take its existence for granted.

“It was amazing that this had become part of the community,” Mr. Shpuntoff said. “But people forgot that when it first happened, it was a whole different situation than today, when people march casually. Back then, people were really afraid and no one really knew what would happen at the first parade. There was organization, sacrifice and commitment by a range of people who had formed a coalition around Julio’s murder.”

Peg Fiore, who at the time of the killing was married to Julio’s brother Ted, said the local gay community was, at first, among the family’s few allies. Weeks after the murder, she and Ted participated in a vigil by the playground where Mr. Rivera was killed, a bit unnerved and unsure if anyone would attend. She said her fears were dispelled when she saw scores of people getting off the subway on Roosevelt Avenue to attend.

She said Mr. Rivera — who had moved to Jackson Heights from Manhattan because he felt it was safer there — was “an unlikely hero,” something that the documentary does not shy away from. In the film, a former lover recounted the time Mr. Rivera used cocaine and then disappeared for a month.

Although the police are more responsive these days, Mr. Dromm remains concerned about attacks on transgender people, of which there have been several in recent years. And lest others take for granted how far they have come, he takes part in an annual moment of silence held on the corner that was named for Mr. Rivera.

Events like that remind Ms. Fiore that her brother-in-law’s death was not in vain. She said she had not forgotten the support her family received from the gay community. It is a lesson she hopes others can learn from, especially during a political season in which Donald J. Trump has based his Republican candidacy for president on what she sees as intolerance.

“The underpinning for their action was racial hatred informed by National Socialism,” the judge said.

The court sentenced the 31-year-old leader of the group to eight years in jail, and his 25-year-old accomplice, who as a local firefighter worked to put out the fire he had helped start, to seven years. The 24-year-old woman received a prison sentence of four and a half years.

All three had expressed regret for their actions on the night of the episode last August in Salzhemmendorf, their hometown.

That confrontation had started when a restaurant employee chastised Mr. Morales, who had been drinking heavily all day, for urinating in the street in front of the business, witnesses said.

A few minutes later on Avenue of the Americas, Mr. Morales encountered Mr. Carson and Mr. Robinson, two gay men from Brooklyn who were out on the town on a warm Friday night. As he passed them, Mr. Morales called the men “gay wrestlers,” Mr. Robinson testified. Mr. Carson spun on his heel and confronted Mr. Morales.

It was an explosive moment. Mr. Carson, 32, was a Brooklyn native, outgoing and proudly open about his sexuality, who worked at a gelato kiosk in Grand Central Terminal. Mr. Morales was from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, unemployed, broke and sleeping on a friend’s couch in Queens. He was armed with a .38-caliber revolver he said he wanted to sell. He had served 11 years in prison for a robbery during which three women were bound with duct tape, choked and assaulted with a pipe.

There, just after midnight on May 18, 2013, in the shadow of a closed bookstore, Mr. Morales shot Mr. Carson while Mr. Robinson was on the telephone with the police, witnesses said.

“This was bigotry, and this was unjustifiable rage,” the lead prosecutor, Shannon Lucey, said in her summation. “The defendant was able to shoot Mark Carson over nothing because Mark Carson was nothing to the defendant. Mark Carson was nothing to the defendant but a subhuman fag.”

In his testimony, Mr. Morales said that he had had sexual relationships with transgender women; he called one of his longtime sexual partners as a witness. “I, Elliot Morales, am not a bigot,” he said. “I don’t hate gays.”

But Ms. Lucey noted that he never took transgender women he slept with on dates or walked in public with them. “The defendant is self-loathing; he wants no one to know or to see who he is,” she said. “He has a lot of self-loathing issues, and that came out when he saw Mark Carson and Danny Robinson being who they are.”

When he was tackled by an officer and arrested a few minutes after the shooting, Mr. Morales said, “I shot him because he tried to act tough.” Then, as another officer turned on his video camera, Mr. Morales laughed maniacally and said, “Diagnosis dead, Doctor.”

One juror, who insisted on anonymity to protect his privacy, said no one on the panel bought Mr. Morales’s claim he had acted in self-defense. Most of the discussion, he said, had been about whether Mr. Morales had singled out Mr. Carson because he was gay or for some other reason.

The juror, a financial services employee from the Upper East Side, said he was convinced that Mr. Morales acted out of prejudice because he seemed intent on attacking gay men the night of the shooting, starting with his belligerent antigay threats at the Annisa Restaurant.

Later, Mr. Morales not only used gay slurs in his argument with Mr. Carson, but also pointedly asked him if he was “with” Mr. Robinson just before pulling the gun, the juror said. “He was kind of categorizing people,” he said.

A second juror, a health care worker from the West Village who also declined to be named for privacy reasons, said the panel did not give much weight to Mr. Morales’s argument that he was not a bigot because he had slept in secret with transgender women. “I think we all felt he had some serious screws loose,” she said.",nytimes.com,True

When I talked to family and friends in the area, I realized that the incident’s timing contributed to deepening feelings of anxiety and vulnerability: Days earlier, I was told, a bomb threat was called in to nearby Anderson University when a Muslim woman was scheduled to speak on behalf of an interfaith group. The same weekend, three young men from a largely Muslim immigrant community were found murdered under mysterious circumstances in Fort Wayne, two and a half hours away.

It’s easy to turn unpleasant episodes into broad feelings of doom — and that’s often a mistake. The Islamic Society and the Indianapolis Muslim community found immediate support from the Indianapolis Jewish Community Relations Council and several local churches. Isolated incidents happen, and stray actors do carry out random acts of hatred.

But these hateful words stained my family’s place of worship just a week after the Republican Party’s leading presidential contender approvingly repeated a story about dipping bullets in pigs’ blood and shooting Muslim rebels and two days before he won seven states in the primary. And all of this came in a year in which there were dozens of cases of harassment, vandalism and violence targeting members of my religion.

At a news conference, Hazem Bata, the Islamic Society’s secretary general, said: “I’m not here to focus on the negative, because once you start focusing on the negative, you start to take on a victim’s mentality. And as Muslims in America, we refuse to be victims in our own country.” This is admirable. It’s important to live without fear.

On cross-examination, Mr. Morales said he had consumed 10 strong drinks in the eight hours leading up the shooting, including six Four Loko malt liquors and four plastic tumblers of rum. He was carrying the loaded gun, he said, because he intended to sell it to a man nicknamed “Money” on the Lower East Side. He had been sleeping on a friend’s sofa in the Rockaways in Queens, he said, and had no money, except for $20 he had borrowed from a niece.

Mr. Morales, who is acting as his own lawyer, denied under cross-examination that he had directed anti-gay slurs at Mr. Carson and Mr. Robinson. “Never, never, not them or anyone else,” he said. “I don’t use that word. Period.”

He also denied challenging the two men to follow him around the corner to settle the dispute. He said he had felt threatened when they followed him and had showed his weapon to “ward them off.” Then, seeing Mr. Carson pull something from his pocket, Mr. Morales said he had fired the gun wildly as he turned to run.

The trial has been delayed several times because Mr. Morales, who served 11 years in prison for armed robbery, rejected four court-appointed lawyers who had been assigned to him before announcing he would represent himself.

There were more delays in recent months because Mr. Morales had asked the court to order that a material witness, Joseph Matos, be brought to New York City from a Florida prison. Mr. Matos was with Mr. Morales the night of the killing.

The murder happened early on a Saturday morning, just after midnight. Ms. Lucey said that several people saw the shooting, including a couple out on a date, an Italian tourist and a graduate student. Mr. Morales was arrested a few minutes later on West Third Street, she said. Ordered to stop, he pulled a pistol on Officer Henry Hoyt, but fumbled the gun. The officer wrestled him to the ground. Ballistics tests confirmed it was the same gun that had been used to kill Mr. Carson, Ms. Lucey said.

Ms. Lucey said Mr. Morales’s anti-gay rant had started earlier in the evening, after he and two friends, Mr. Matos and Oscar Robles, had driven from Upper Manhattan down to Barrow Street in Mr. Matos’s car.

Mr. Robles testified on Monday that he was a superintendent at a residential building at 9 Barrow Street and needed to retrieve his phone charger. The three men had been having drinks at Mr. Robles’s apartment on 140th Street earlier in the evening, he said.

While Mr. Robles was inside the building, Mr. Morales urinated on the front window of the Annisa restaurant on the street, and the manager came out to tell him to leave, Ms. Lucey said in her opening remarks. Enraged, Mr. Morales burst into the restaurant, yelled anti-gay slurs at a bartender and threatened his life. He yanked his gray sweatshirt up to reveal the pistol, she told the jury.

But before the police arrived at the restaurant, Mr. Morales and his two friends climbed into the car and drove to a pizza place on Sixth Avenue near Eighth Street, Ms. Lucey said. There they encountered Mr. Carson and Mr. Robinson, who were walking up the avenue, headed to a bar on Eighth Street. It was warm, and they were wearing shorts and tank tops. Mr. Robinson, 34, an office manager for a dermatologist, said he and Mr. Carson were lifelong friends and roommates but were never romantically involved. “We did everything together,” he said.

As they passed by Mr. Morales, they heard him say, “You all look like gay wrestlers,” Mr. Robinson recalled. His friend was offended and went back to confront Mr. Morales. “It was Mark doing most of the talking,” Mr. Robinson said. “He was like: ‘You’re not going to do anything! You’re not going to do anything!’”

Mr. Robinson said Mr. Morales responded by saying, “Let’s go around the corner and I’ll show you,” and began using anti-gay slurs. They decided to follow him, Mr. Carson leading the way. “He was just saying ‘He’s not going to do anything, he’s not going to do anything,’” Mr. Robinson said.",nytimes.com,True

According to the report, the hatreds of those two groups fed in part off the same social discord — battles over the Confederate flag, highly publicized police killings and the attendant rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Klan groups saw a comeback in 2015, more than doubling to 190 from 72 a year earlier, the center said. The growth was linked mainly to the dissipation of two larger Klan organizations, but the center said adherents were also galvanized by efforts to lower Confederate flags in Southern states after the mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, S.C., last June.

The number of black separatist groups rose to 180, up from 113 in 2014, the center said. The organizations were driven by anger over police brutality in the same way as the Black Lives Matter movement, but they went beyond demanding reforms to demonize whites, gays and especially Jews.

The center identified 34 anti-Muslim groups, whose anger ratcheted up late in 2015 after the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. In a year in which the battle over same-sex marriage culminated in a landmark Supreme Court ruling guaranteeing the right nationwide, the center counted 48 anti-L.G.B.T. groups that responded by redoubling their efforts toward codifying discrimination.

The center cited the sometimes caustic rhetoric of the Republican presidential candidates as a reason for some of the blossoming hatreds. While it faulted several Republican candidates, the report singled out Mr. Trump for his remarks on Muslims and immigration across the southern border as the chief catalyst for creeping intolerance.

“White supremacist forums are awash with electoral joy, having dubbed Trump their ‘Glorious Leader,’ ” Mr. Potok wrote in the journal. “And Trump has repaid the compliments, retweeting hate posts and spreading their false statistics on black-on-white crime.”

The Trump campaign did not return a message seeking comment.

Among the states with the most hate groups were California, Florida, Georgia, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas..

Hate crimes have been declining in the United States over the last decade, according to F.B.I. data. The most recent numbers showed 5,462 reported incidents in 2014, down from 7,642 a decade earlier.

Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center cautioned that the F.B.I. data, which relies on reporting by local law enforcement agencies, undercounted the actual number of cases. A 2013 Justice Department study estimated that cases of hate-inspired victimization occur on the order of more than 250,000 times a year.

In a separate survey released on Wednesday, the center also found an increase in so-called patriot groups, inspired in part by land use conflicts in Oregon and Nevada, where the cattle rancher Cliven Bundy led a dramatic standoff with federal authorities in 2014.

“We can’t ignore the backdrop against which this is happening, with all the hate crimes against Muslims, all over the place,” said Imraan Siddiqi, the executive director of Arizona’s chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

In recent months, Islamophobic posters have appeared at American University; the University of California, Los Angeles; and other college campuses. At Virginia Tech, the message “I will be here 11/11/2015 to kill all muslims” was scrawled on a bathroom wall. In October, an Indiana University student was arrested after trying to yank a Muslim woman’s head scarf as she dined outside a restaurant, according to the police in Bloomington, Ind.

The University of Arizona has a diverse student body, and students and professors described its culture as generally inclusive. But minority groups on campus say they are not immune from mistreatment and misconceptions.

Meetings between faculty members and students were held in six campus cultural centers at the university during the fall, spurred by racially charged episodes at the University of Missouri and elsewhere. According to faculty notes on the meetings, gay students spoke of harassment by classmates, black students told of being steered away from disciplines and degrees that were perceived as white-only, and Asian students talked about “unhealthy generalizations,” in particular about Muslims.

Lynn Nadel, a professor of psychology and cognitive sciences and the chairman of the university’s faculty, said the meetings served as a call for action. “We don’t need to wait for the explosion to look around and find out for ourselves how we’re doing and how we must change,” he said.

Despite repeated efforts by the university and the managers of the apartment complex to stop the harassment of the mosque and its members, problems have persisted. Mumina Obeid, a premed student at the university and a Sunday school teacher at the Islamic Center, said that more than once she had picked up liquor bottles littering the turf where children play during recess.

Ms. Obeid, 20, who was born in Tucson to a Syrian father and a Mexican mother, said a 5-year-old boy had come up to her holding a can of chewing tobacco he found on the playground.

“What kind of message are we sending to our children when their place of worship is treated like a trash can?” she asked.

Last month, when classes at the university resumed and cans and bottles started crashing onto the mosque’s parking lot again, the landlord began considering whether to close the balconies.

In a letter to tenants and their parents, Rand A. Ginsburg, a senior vice president at GMH Capital Partners, threatened fines and more evictions, pledging zero tolerance for “actions involving violence or destructive behavior toward other human beings or organizations” and for “words or actions that reflect racial or religious hostility.”

The Islamic Center moved to its current location in the 1990s, when the university, whose student body now numbers about 42,000, had roughly 10,000 fewer students. Back then, the tallest buildings in the neighborhood were a handful of stories high.

As the university grew and a streetcar linking campus and downtown began operating, the city approved zoning changes allowing high-density buildings — to house students and keep them away from the residential neighborhoods surrounding campus, said Steve Kozachik, a city councilman representing the area.

The images included cartoons of cross-dressers applying makeup and of muscular men wearing skimpy towels.

It is unclear whether the recent statements will lead to new restrictions. The spokesman for the Communications Ministry, Ismail Cawidu, did not return calls for comment on Monday.

Even so, the national atmosphere regarding gay rights may be growing more highly charged. Mr. Oetomo, the veteran activist, said a party in Surabaya this month organized around encouraging attendees to be tested for H.I.V. was halted by the local police for not having the proper permits.

Human rights campaigners say the situation is all the more surprising because of how modest activists’ requests are relative to movements in Western countries.

“They aren’t advocating for same-sex marriage, for example,” said Kyle Knight, a researcher on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights at Human Rights Watch in New York, which is calling on the administration of Mr. Joko to mount a fuller defense of Indonesian gays.

“Why the play has not been done before is the question,” she added.

Sweden’s history with Africa dates to the 17th century, when it had minor colonies there, and, later, in the Caribbean. It lost those colonies to other European powers and abolished slavery in 1847. The work of Swedish missionaries in Africa in the 20th century brought some Africans to Sweden, particularly adoptees and students.

From the 1970s onward, Sweden took in large numbers of African migrants and refugees, especially from conflict zones like the Horn of Africa.

Representing various experiences, African-Swedes, those defined as residents with roots in sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas and the Caribbean, number “around 180,000, of whom 60 percent are foreign born, while 40 percent were born in Sweden,” according to the Multicultural Center’s Afrophobia Report of 2014, commissioned by Sweden’s ministry of integration.

For decades, Sweden’s migrant, refugee and cultural policies have been open and tolerant. Critics, however, point to challenges of social and economic integration, citing huge disparities between the quality of life for African-Swedes and members of the larger society.

In addition, a 2015 report by the United Nations Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent pointed to rising hate crimes against African-Swedes.

“Afro-Swedes are most exposed to hate crimes, and reports of Afrophobic hate crimes have increased by 24 percent since 2008,” the report said. “In this context, hate crime units and investigators are insufficient. Many cases are reported, but few are investigated and prosecuted.”

Many here point to Sweden’s view of itself as a humanitarian society as part of the problem. Tobias Hubinette, an associate professor at Karlstad University and an author of the Afrophobia Report, said that there were many good things about Sweden but that they “blind us to the disparities because we are not used to seeing them.”

The actors in this take of the Broadway classic, who represent various backgrounds and experiences of African-Swedes, were not hesitant to explain the challenges of integration in Sweden.

Generational clashes in the play also reflect the reality of many African-Swedes.

“When I told my mother that I wanted to do music, she was shocked,” said Asha Ali, who is of Somali descent and plays the role of Beneatha Younger. Her mother, from a traditional society, did not approve of a career in entertainment.

In the early 1960s, Lisbeth Gronlund, who translated “A Raisin in the Sun,” was a Swedish high school exchange student in the United States. Her stay made her aware of the racial disparities in the country, so she decided to pursue studies in African-American literature when she returned to Europe. While conducting research for her master’s degree, she corresponded with Robert Nemiroff, Ms. Hansberry’s former husband and a promoter of her work.

Mr. Nemiroff invited Ms. Gronlund to the United States to examine Ms. Hansberry’s writings.

“I got access to what was then unpublished material,” Ms. Gronlund said.

Ms. Gronlund became aware through a friend that Ms. Bushell-Mingo, the director, was organizing a production of the play in Stockholm and was looking for someone to translate it. Ms. Gronlund contacted Ms. Bushell-Mingo to set up a meeting.

“It’s a story about everyone who has felt a stranger in their own land,” she said. “How do you use literature to address issues that people don’t want to hear about?”

The actors, who said they followed African-American pop culture and politics, including the Black Lives Matter movement, expressed their admiration for the play.

“What’s great about this production is that you are able to see yourself,” Mr. Lenneman said. “I can relate to that.”

Mr. Amsellem said it took him only seconds to understand what was happening to him on that Monday in mid-January: a stranger was attempting to kill him because he was wearing a Jewish skullcap.

That instinctive wariness, combined with the green-leather Torah — there are now deep gashes in the book — saved him. “It is thanks to this book that I avoided some very serious blows,” he said quietly, sitting in his lawyer’s office here.

Mr. Amsellem, a father of five, was strolling to work in the north Marseille district where he grew up, attended school and now works and lives. Suddenly he felt “violent blows” on his back.

“It took me a moment to realize what was going on, that he was hitting me because I was a Jew,” Mr. Amsellem said. “I turned around and realized it was somebody I didn’t know. I realized he was there to kill. I said, ‘Stop, stop, stop!’ but he heard nothing.”

Deflecting the blows as best he could, Mr. Amsellem tried to run. He stumbled and fell. “And when I was on the ground, I felt I was not going to survive,” he said. “I really saw his eyes. And I saw someone very cold.”

Passers-by heard his cries, saw what was occurring, and gave chase. The attacker fled, and the police caught him at a nearby Métro stop.

The episode soon reverberated throughout the country. From the president on down, French officials condemned it. The interior minister came to Marseille to express solidarity. Supporters of the beloved local soccer club said they would wear a hat to the next match in sympathy. An anti-racism march was organized.

Even so, this is a country that continues to grapple with its complicated history with Jews, and to balance its ideal of a secular public society against the beliefs and identities of its religious and ethnic minorities.

A wall inscribed with the names of thousands of Jews who were deported to their deaths by the Nazis — the French police assisted in the roundup — stands, largely hidden from public view, in the courtyard of the Grand Synagogue here.

In the wake of the attack on Mr. Amsellem, a top community official here called on Jews to stop wearing skullcaps in public, provoking a furious backlash from other community leaders in Paris. “It was my duty,” said the official, Zvi Ammar, who was startled by the outcry. “My only goal was to preserve human life.”

The teenager being held for the attack hardly fits the conventional profile of a radical Islamist: He is a Turkish Kurd, a group at war with the Islamic State.

The suspect — whose name is being withheld because of his age — has “very good marks in school,” said Mr. Amsellem’s lawyer, Fabrice Labi, and lives with his immigrant family in well-maintained if drab apartments north of the city center. His father, who brought the family to France five years ago, is a tile-setter with a solid income.

On a recent frigid morning, the suspect’s older brother was speaking anxiously into a cellphone outside the family’s apartment. His mother, wearing a head-covering, came to the door of the apartment. Both slammed it shut when asked for comment.

The case has been transferred to Paris-based antiterrorism prosecutors, a measure of how seriously officials have taken it.

Yet the young man’s connection to the perpetual undertow of anti-Semitism that exists here as elsewhere — “dirty Jew” yelled at people leaving the synagogue, conspiracy theories among Muslim youth in the city’s tough housing projects — appears tenuous to nonexistent.

“It is not the anti-Jewish discourse that formed this young man who went out to kill,” said Yamina Benchenni, a teacher who has heard plenty of such talk from her years of working in Marseille’s northern precincts. “He was in solitude.

At the Grand Synagogue after the morning services on a recent Saturday, the atmosphere was jovial at the kiddush, the post-prayer collation. Skullcaps were de rigueur, and while there was some talk of the attack, it was hardly laden with anxiety.

“It doesn’t shock us that much,” said Michele Allouche, who lives in the old downtown neighborhood near the 19th-century synagogue. “We’re waiting for it. There’s huge anti-Semitism in France.”

But the attack’s bloodthirsty undertones — the deadly blade, the will to decapitate, the coldness of the would-be killer — continued to stir unease.

A vaguely written “gay propaganda” law passed in 2013 created a toxic environment for gay men and lesbians in Russia. Now, some lawmakers want to further denigrate and stigmatize gay people. A new bill scheduled for debate on Friday in the lower house of Parliament would allow the authorities to impose fines and even jail time for public displays of affection between people of the same sex.

The law would criminalize “the public expression of nontraditional sexual relations, manifested in a public demonstration of personal perverted sexual preferences in public spaces.” If such displays of affection happen in educational or cultural institutions, a jail sentence of up to 15 days can be imposed.

Ivan Nikitchuk, one of the lawmakers who introduced the bill, described it as an effort to preserve longstanding social norms. “This is our country, where we’ve always respected traditions, where we’ve always had and still have today a conscience and the concept of shame,” he told the Russian news site Meduza. “And all these bearded men kissing is nothing but nauseating.”

It is not clear how much support the bill has, but its consideration can serve only to stir hatred toward people who are gender-nonconforming or gay. That further threatens a community that has faced widespread violence. Human Rights Watch documented a rise in harassment of gay people and violent attacks after passage of the 2013 law, which outlawed promotion of what the government classified as “nontraditional sexual relationships.” The authorities in Russia have done little to prosecute hate crimes targeting gay people, many of whom have endured beatings.

President Vladimir Putin has not made it clear whether he backs the new bill. He signed the 2013 propaganda bill into law, but he has sought at times to dispel the notion that Russia has institutionalized homophobia. In the lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Mr. Putin sought to dispel concerns that gay athletes and spectators could be vulnerable. He later claimed, “We have no persecution at all.” That, of course, was a lie.

The rambling writings of Mr. Houser, 59, made few references to specific people — he generally chose to denigrate demographic groups as a whole — but he paid tribute to Dylann Roof, who is charged in the June killings of nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.

Mr. Roof, Mr. Houser wrote, was “green but good.” He also said, “Thank you for the wake up call Dylann.”

In the years before the shooting in Lafayette, Mr. Houser’s family members and acquaintances in Alabama and Georgia knew him as a man who was prone to rages. When he was evicted from a home in Phenix City, Ala., for instance, he was accused of ransacking the place by pouring cement into the plumbing, damaging gas lines and leaving human feces in the home.

He legally purchased a handgun at an Alabama pawnshop in 2014 and ultimately drifted to Louisiana. There, he filled his wide-ruled journal and planned the assault at the Grand Theater.

Google search terms are probably not very helpful in predicting hate crimes, despite what Evan Soltas and Seth Stephens-Davidowitz say in “The Rise of Hate Search” (Sunday Review, Dec. 13).

First, the article seems to suggest that correlation is causation. Sometimes a relationship may appear to exist between two variables when it doesn’t.

Second, the article quantifies the number of times a search term is used, but it doesn’t quantify how many people typed in the search term. One person is capable of typing a search term multiple times.

Lastly, if Mr. Soltas and Mr. Stephens-Davidowitz are serious about trying to positively correlate Google search terms with a psychological mind-set, they need to define parameters more clearly.

I thought of those long-forgotten episodes of Los Angeles history when Southern California was dragged this month into a global maelstrom of violence. In a grim echo of earlier attacks in France, two terrorists carried out a mass murder in San Bernardino. Local mosques have been vandalized. And a terror threat (said to have been transmitted via Germany) closed the Los Angeles public schools for a day.

Here, as elsewhere, there are those who believe there is safety to be found in cultural homogeneity — and danger lurking in our embrace of diversity and openness. I’ve been listening to our local xenophobes rail about the perils of Mexican immigrants for decades. Now they’ve found Donald J. Trump adding to their “close the border” chorus with calls to bar Muslims as well as Mexicans.

In California, these are old arguments. Thankfully, we also have a long tradition of resistance to intolerance.

Mr. Zesch’s account reveals that some white Angelenos bravely tried to stop the mob, and gave shelter to the Chinese, saving lives. The day after the riot, a newspaper reported that the people of Los Angeles, “sickened with last night’s horrors, are determined that no stigma of like character shall ever again rest upon us.” National outrage followed, and local authorities were forced to put at least some members of the mob on trial.

A more peaceful multicultural Los Angeles was built on the foundation of those horrific events.

In one of my favorite books of California history, “The Los Angeles Plaza: Sacred and Contested Space,” by William D. Estrada, the long fight for social justice and cultural cohabitation plays out in the old brick-and-adobe heart of the city. The anarchist Emma Goldman plays a cameo, as does the Japanese-American labor organizer Karl Yoneda, who has to travel to Seattle to marry his fiancée, the fellow activist Elaine Black, to get around California’s anti-miscegenation laws.

Today, thanks to two centuries of activism, and the shifting demographics of a state where nearly everyone seems to belong to a “minority,” multiculturalism has become the daily, working normal of Southern California.

That was the case when the employees of the San Bernardino County Department of Health held their annual Christmas gathering earlier this month. Those killed and wounded in the terrorists’ gunfire included people who were African-American, Jewish, Christian and Muslim; who were gay and straight; and who had roots in Vietnam, Iran, Mexico and other countries.

One of their attackers reportedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, which, seeking to impose its rigid religious conformity, has executed Shiite Muslims, Alawites, Coptic Christians, Yazidis and others. These acts amount to modern-day lynchings.

California’s long history of struggle, and the patient building of democratic institutions, gives us hope that we are immunized against the return of violent hatreds. I have little doubt that future historians of our turbulent times will see the construction of a civilization that values tolerance and diversity as the crowning achievement of both California and the United States.

In recent years, there has been an average of 12.6 suspected hate crimes against Muslims in the United States a month, based on F.B.I. data analyzed by the research group.

But the rate of attacks has tripled since the attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 by Islamic State operatives, with 38 attacks regarded as anti-Islamic in nature, according to the analysis, which was based on reports from the news media and civil rights groups.

Eighteen of the episodes have come since the shooting in San Bernardino on Dec. 2 by a Muslim couple who were supporters of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which left 14 people dead.

The frequency of the recent attacks has not reached the levels seen in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when there were hundreds of attacks on Muslims, and some Sikhs mistaken for Muslims, but Mr. Levin said they were similar types of hate-crime attacks.

In Pittsburgh, a passenger in a cab shot the driver, who was Muslim, in the back after the passenger angrily asked him about ISIS and mocked the Prophet Muhammad, the authorities said. And in Anaheim, Calif., a bullet-riddled copy of the Quran was left outside an Islamic clothing store.

The most recent episode cataloged by the San Bernardino research group came Tuesday, when a man reportedly pulled a knife on a Muslim woman at a carwash and threatened her.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/opinion/sunday/the-rise-of-hate-search.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"When Islamophobic searches are at their highest levels, such as during the controversy over the “ground zero mosque” in 2010 or around the anniversary of 9/11, hate crimes tend to be at their highest levels, too.

In 2014, according to the F.B.I., anti-Muslim hate crimes represented 16.3 percent of the total of 1,092 reported offenses motivated by religious bias. Anti-Semitism still led the way as a motive for these crimes, at 58.2 percent.

Hate crimes may seem chaotic and unpredictable, a consequence of random neurons that happen to fire in the brains of a few angry young men. But we can explain some of the rise and fall of anti-Muslim hate crimes just based on what people are Googling about Muslims.

The frightening thing is this: If our model is right, Islamophobia and thus anti-Muslim hate crimes are currently higher than at any time since the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. Although it will take awhile for the F.B.I. to collect and analyze the data before we know whether anti-Muslim hate crimes are in fact rising spectacularly now, Islamophobic searches in the United States were 10 times higher the week after the Paris attacks than the week before. They have been elevated since then and rose again after the San Bernardino attack.

How can these Google searches track Islamophobia so well? Who searches for “I hate Muslims” anyway?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

We often think of Google as a source from which we seek information directly, on topics like the weather, who won last night’s game or how to make apple pie. But sometimes we type our uncensored thoughts into Google, without much hope that Google will be able to help us. The search window can serve as a kind of confessional.

There are thousands of searches every year, for example, for “I hate my boss,” “people are annoying” and “I am drunk.” Google searches expressing moods, rather than looking for information, represent a tiny sample of everyone who is actually thinking those thoughts.

There are about 1,600 searches for “I hate my boss” every month in the United States. In a survey of American workers, half of the respondents said that they had left a job because they hated their boss; there are about 150 million workers in America.

In November, there were about 3,600 searches in the United States for “I hate Muslims” and about 2,400 for “kill Muslims.” We suspect these Islamophobic searches represent a similarly tiny fraction of those who had the same thoughts but didn’t drop them into Google.

“If someone is willing to say ‘I hate them’ or ‘they disgust me,’ we know that those emotions are as good a predictor of behavior as actual intent,” said Susan Fiske, a social psychologist at Princeton, pointing to 50 years of psychology research on anti-black bias. “If people are making expressive searches about Muslims, it’s likely to be tied to anti-Muslim hate crime.”

Google searches seem to suffer from selection bias: Instead of asking a random sample of Americans how they feel, you just get information from those who are motivated to search. But this restriction may actually help search data predict hate crimes.

“Public polls, properly done, describe what a representative sample of Americans believe and feel about an issue,” Paul Sniderman, a political scientist at Stanford, explained in an email. “Google searches answer a different question: What do people excited enough by an issue to comment on it think and believe about it? The answer to this question, just because it is unrepresentative of the public as a whole, may be a better bet to predict hate crimes.”

Last Saturday, driving home from an event, she stopped at a traffic light, where she saw a man in the next car over glaring at her. He rolled down his window and called her a “Muslim bitch.” When Ms. Nizami started to drive away, he trailed her and then tried to run her off the road with his red Chevy Impala.

“It was terrifying,” said Ms. Nizami. “Ever since San Bernardino, I was scared someone would blame me, would react this way.” After the incident, she said, she ordered Mace spray and a dashboard camera from Amazon and wants to get her car windows tinted.

Searches for information about Islam and Muslims did rise after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. Yet they rose far less than searches for hate did. “Who is Muhammad?” “what do Muslims believe?” and “what does the Quran say?” for instance, were no match for intolerance. In the days following the San Bernardino attacks, for every American concerned with “Islamophobia,” another was searching for “kill Muslims.” While hate searches were about 20 percent of all top searches about Muslims before the attack, more than half of all search volume about Muslims became hateful in the hours that followed it.

It is not just that hatred against Muslims is extremely high today. It’s that it’s exceptional compared with prejudice against every other group in the United States.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

We examined prejudicial searches against black people, white people, gay people, Asians, Jews, Mexicans and Christians. We estimate that negative attitudes against Muslims today are higher than prejudice against any group in any month since 2004, when Google began preserving detailed data on search volumes.

The search data also tells us that changes in Americans’ policy concerns have been dramatic. They happened, quite literally, within minutes of the terror attacks.

Before the Paris attacks, 60 percent of Americans’ searches that took an obvious view of Syrian refugees saw them positively, asking how they could “help,” “volunteer” or “aid.” The other 40 percent were negative and mostly expressed skepticism about security. After Paris, however, the share of people opposed to refugees rose to 80 percent.

Or consider searches related to mosques. For most of the past decade, the top searches for mosques expressed cultural curiosity — “what are mosques?” “what does mosque mean?” and “when do Muslims go to mosque?” But right after the San Bernardino shooting, searches about closing mosques, a once-unthinkable policy, surged to a sixth of Americans’ search volume about mosques.

What, then, can we do to fight Islamophobia?

Unfortunately, there is not much evidence that some of the most obvious-sounding solutions might work. One idea might be to increase cultural integration. This is based on the “contact hypothesis”: If more Americans have Muslim neighbors, they will learn not to harbor irrational hate.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

We did not find support for this in the data — in fact, we found evidence for the opposite. We looked at searches in the 10 counties with the highest Muslim populations in the United States. On average, these counties are about 11 percent Muslim, compared with 0.9 percent of the United States as a whole. We estimate, in these 10 counties, that anti-Muslim search rates are about eight times higher than they are in the rest of the country.

That’s evidence for the dominance of the “racial threat” hypothesis, which predicts that proximity breeds tension, not trust. John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, said, “This is one of the better chances for contact to work, and it doesn’t.”

Another solution might be for leaders to talk about the importance of tolerance and the irrationality of hatred, as President Obama did in his Oval Office speech last Sunday night. He asked Americans to reject discrimination and religious tests for immigration. The reactions to his speech offer an excellent opportunity to see what works and what doesn’t work.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mostly, we found that Mr. Obama’s well-meaning words fell on deaf ears. Overall, in fact, his speech provoked intolerance. The president said, “It is the responsibility of all Americans — of every faith — to reject discrimination.” But searches calling Muslims “terrorists,” “bad,” “violent” and “evil” doubled during and shortly after his speech.

Mr. Obama also said, “It is our responsibility to reject religious tests on who we admit into this country.” But negative searches about Syrian refugees rose 60 percent. Searches asking how to help Syrian refugees dropped 35 percent. The president asked us to “not forget that freedom is more powerful than fear.” But searches for “kill Muslims” tripled during his speech.

There was one line, however, that did trigger the type of response Mr. Obama might have wanted. He said, “Muslim Americans are our friends and our neighbors, our co-workers, our sports heroes and yes, they are our men and women in uniform, who are willing to die in defense of our country.”

After this line, for the first time in more than a year, the top Googled noun after “Muslim” was not “terrorists,” “extremists” or “refugees.” It was “athletes,” followed by “soldiers.” And, in fact, “athletes” kept the top spot for a full day afterward.

Jon Favreau, the president’s former chief speechwriter, was not surprised that this line was so effective. He singled it out as the best in an early draft he read, and noticed the many shocked tweets from those who had learned that Shaquille O’Neal is Muslim.

“Finding out that someone who’s been a hero of yours, that you’ve looked up to your whole life, happens to be a Muslim,” Mr. Favreau said. “That’s a pretty powerful reminder, this is a religion that is a part of America and has always been a part of America.”

On the whole, though, the response to the president’s speech shows that appealing to the better angels of an angry mob will most likely just backfire. Subtly provoking their curiosity, giving them new information, and offering them new images of the group that is stoking their rage: That may direct their thoughts in different, more positive directions.

After sifting through the search data, we think there are three things the rest of us not giving speeches in the Oval Office can do.

First, parents should be talking to their kids about how the overwhelming majority of Muslim Americans pose no threat to them.

Second, police departments would be wise to use search data to allocate resources through predictive policing. The data, for example, could tell police chiefs when sending a cop to do an extra drive through a Muslim neighborhood, or making sure that the town mosque was safe overnight, would be a good idea.

Third, Muslim Americans are right to take some precautions. Like most grave threats, hate crimes are rare. Our model suggests that, if Islamophobic sentiment stays at its current level, about one in every 10,000 Muslims will be the victim of a reported hate crime over the next year, similar to the rate of automobile fatalities and orders of magnitude higher than the chance of being a victim of terrorism.

The human capacity for rage and anger will never disappear. But there is a huge difference between this flare-up of hatred and those from decades past.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/opinion/the-words-that-killed-medieval-jews.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Before about 1100, Christian devotions focused on Christ’s divine nature and triumph over death. Images of the crucifixion showed Jesus alive and healthy on the cross. For this reason, his killers were not major focuses in Christian thought. No anti-Jewish polemics were composed during these centuries; artworks portrayed his executioners not as Jews, but as Roman soldiers (which was more historically accurate) or as yokels. Though there are scattered records of anti-Jewish episodes like forced conversions, we find no consistent pattern of anti-Jewish violence.

In the decades around 1100, a shift in the focus of Christian veneration brought Jews to the fore. In an effort to spur compassion among Christian worshipers, preachers and artists began to dwell in vivid detail on Christ’s pain. Christ morphed from triumphant divine judge to suffering human savior. A parallel tactic, designed to foster a sense of Christian unity, was to emphasize the cruelty of his supposed tormentors, the Jews.

Partly out of identification with this newly vulnerable Christ, partly in response to recent Turkish military successes, and partly because an internal reform movement was questioning fundamentals of faith, Christians began to see themselves as threatened, too. In 1084 the pope wrote that Christianity “has fallen under the scorn, not only of the Devil, but of Jews, Saracens, and pagans.” The “Goad of Love,” a retelling of the crucifixion that is considered the first anti-Jewish Passion treatise, was written around 1155-80. It describes Jews as consumed with sadism and blood lust. They were seen as enemies not only of Christ, but also of living Christians; it was at this time that Jews began to be accused of ritually sacrificing Christian children.

Ferocious anti-Jewish rhetoric began to permeate sermons, plays and polemical texts. Jews were labeled demonic and greedy. In one diatribe, the head of the most influential monastery in Christendom thundered at the Jews: “Why are you not called brute animals? Why not beasts?” Images began to portray Jews as hooknosed caricatures of evil.

The first records of large-scale anti-Jewish violence coincide with this rhetorical shift. Although the pope who preached the First Crusade had called only for an “armed pilgrimage” to retake Jerusalem from Muslims, the first victims of the Crusade were not the Turkish rulers of Jerusalem but Jewish residents of the German Rhineland. Contemporary accounts record the crusaders asking why, if they were traveling to a distant land to “kill and to subjugate all those kingdoms that do not believe in the Crucified,” they should not also attack “the Jews, who killed and crucified him?”

Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Jews were massacred in towns where they had peacefully resided for generations. At no point did Christian authorities promote or consent to the violence. Christian theology, which applied the Psalm verse “Slay them not” to Jews, and insisted that Jews were not to be killed for their religion, had not changed. Clerics were at a loss to explain the attacks. A churchman from a nearby town attributed the massacres to “some error of mind.”

But not all the Rhineland killers were crazy. The crusaders set out in the Easter season. Both crusade and Easter preaching stirred up rage about the crucifixion and fear of hostile and threatening enemies. It is hardly surprising that armed and belligerent bands turned such rhetoric into anti-Jewish action.

For the rest of the Middle Ages, this pattern was repeated: Preaching about the crusades, proclamations of Jewish “enmity” or unsubstantiated anti-Jewish accusations were followed by outbreaks of anti-Jewish violence, which the same shocked authorities that had aroused Christians’ passions were then unable to restrain. We see this in the Rhineland during the Second Crusade (1146), in England during the Third Crusade (1190), in Franconia in 1298, in many locales following the Black Death in 1348, and in Iberia in 1391. Sometimes the perpetrators were zealous holy warriors, sometimes they were opportunistic business rivals, sometimes they were parents grieving for children lost to accident or crime, or fearful of the ravages of a new disease.

Some may well have been insane. But sane or deranged, they did not pick their victims in a vacuum. It was repeated and dehumanizing excoriation that led those medieval Christians to attack people who had long been their neighbors.

Today’s purveyors of anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-police and anti-abortion rhetoric and imagery may not for a moment intend to provoke violence against Muslims, immigrants, police officers and health care providers. But in the light of history, they should not be shocked when that violence comes to pass.",nytimes.com,True

Corporal Carter said the investigation was complicated because the truck, where the explicitly anti-Islam portion of the graffiti was spray-painted, was driven away from the temple before the incident was reported to the authorities. Temple officials provided the police with a photograph of the vandalized truck, but they have been unable to provide the name of its owner.

Now, with the F.B.I. saying that one of those responsible for the San Bernardino massacre had expressed Islamic State sympathies on Facebook, American Muslims are bracing for more hate directed their way. Overnight on Friday, vandals broke all the windows at the Islamic Center of Palm Beach in Florida, turned over furniture in the prayer room and left bloody stains throughout the facility. The F.B.I. is investigating death threats left by voice mail at a mosque in Manassas, Va.

The attacks have left American Muslims feeling defensive and vulnerable just as the San Bernardino attack is forcing them to come to grips with the prospect that the threat from terrorists within their midst is very, very real.

The attack in San Bernardino, which left 14 victims dead and 21 injured, was in many ways the nightmare scenario for Muslims trying to gain full acceptance in American society: Syed Rizwan Farook, the husband who committed mass homicide with his wife, was raised in the United States and was an American citizen. He had a college education, a stable job, a comfortable home and a baby, and displayed no outward signs of anger, mental illness or radicalization. He worshiped and was known at several local mosques.

At one of those mosques — Dar al-Uloom al-Islamiyah in San Bernardino, down a long road and surrounded by palm trees — Imam Mahmood Nadvi said he had never detected any warning signs in the few conversations he had had with Mr. Farook, an inspector for the county health department.

“Everyone had an image of him being a successful person,” Imam Nadvi said. “He had a degree. He had a good post.”

The imam called the shooting a shock and a mystery. Mr. Farook, he said, “does not even represent humanity.”

Mahoor Nadvi, a teacher and assistant imam, said the mosque had received threats.

“This all has to do with ignorance,” he said.

In a news conference Friday, lawyers for Mr. Farook’s family cautioned the public against jumping to conclusions about the attackers’ motivations. One lawyer, David Chesley, said the F.B.I.’s claim that Mr. Farook’s wife, Tashfeen Malik, had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State on Facebook was “nebulous” evidence.

“Until there is absolute, clear evidence, every headline doesn’t have to say ‘Muslim massacre’ or ‘Muslim shooters,’ because it’s going to cause intolerance,” Mr. Chesley said.

However, Muslim Americans are now confronting the fact that to many Americans, Mr. Farook and other terrorists do represent Islam — especially since polls show that most Americans know no Muslims and little about Islam.

“My identity and everything that I am becomes erased every time one of these incidents occurs,” said Nabihah Maqbool, 27, a law student at the University of Chicago. “It all becomes collapsed into these senseless acts of violence being committed by people who are part of my group.”

Like many other Muslim American women, Ms. Maqbool said that she had considered taking off her hijab, or head scarf, out of fear of being victimized. She said that driving back to Chicago after celebrating Thanksgiving with her family, she had decided not to stop and pray on the grassy lawn outside an interstate rest stop, as she usually does.

“I just got so nervous that something could happen to me by any unhinged individual who saw me as someone who deserved violence,” Ms. Maqbool said.

A chart provided by Stephen G. Fischer Jr., chief of multimedia productions for the F.B.I.’s criminal justice information service, showed that bias-related hate crimes against Muslims were at a peak in 2001, with 481 reported.

The group that organized the protest posted on Facebook a list of the names and addresses of dozens of Muslims and what they called “Muslim sympathizers.”

Khalid Y. Hamideh, a spokesman for the Islamic Association of North Texas and a Dallas lawyer, called the mosque protest “un-American.”

Harvard pioneered the “case method,” in which students read court rulings, and classes are a give-and-take of questions and answers. But that method, some students said, fails to account for how external factors, like race, might have affected a legal decision.

“We’re using this as precedent, we’re not being taught now to reverse these precedents, we’re just forced to regurgitate them,” a second-year student, Aya Saed, said.

In a twist, the black tape used on the portraits had apparently been used in an earlier protest, which sought to have the law school change its seal. Students had put the tape on mats displaying the seal to protest the inclusion of the family crest of a slave-owning family named Royall that they say was involved in brutally putting down a slave rebellion in Antigua. The family also owned slaves in Massachusetts and one member, Isaac Royall Jr., bequeathed part of his estate to Harvard, which was crucial to establishing the law school.

“It appears that whoever did this took the tape from those mats and used the strips of tapes from those mats and placed them on the black professors’ portraits,” said Alexander J. Clayborne, a third-year student here who has been involved in a campaign to change the law school’s crest. The student-led campaign called Royall Must Fall circulated an open letter Wednesday calling for a change in its seal.

My father raised me to cherish and protect free speech, but the very liberty that free speech was designed to protect is at stake when it is used to spread venom and incite violence.

The companies who’ve turned social media platforms into very big business argue, and rightly so, that monitoring each post is nearly impossible, that permitting users the freedom of expression is essential, that there are already steps in place to combat hate speech. All that is true. But something new is happening today, and what Facebook, Twitter and the others must realize is that the question of incitement on social media isn’t just a logistical or financial question but, first and foremost, a moral one.

This wave of terrorism is different from anything we’ve seen, involving not terrorists recruited by shadowy organizations but ordinary young men and women inspired by hateful and bloody messages they see online to take matters and blades into their own hands. Just as many of us now argue that we should hold gun manufacturers responsible for the devastation brought about by their products, we should demand the same of social media platforms, now being used as sources of inspiration and instruction for murderers.

One immediate solution is to remove blatant incitement without waiting for formal complaints — it’s one thing to express a political opinion, even one that supports violent measures, and another to publish a how-to chart designed to train and recruit future terrorists. To that end, an Israeli nonprofit took legal action against Facebook earlier this week, demanding that the company do more to monitor and remove unacceptable content. My family joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs. Still, I believe that any truly successful effort to curb the culture of hate on social media must come from the companies themselves.

Companies can become more active in combating hate. The popular social networking site Reddit, for example, not only banned specific types of unacceptable content — such as a group encouraging rape — but it also engaged specific user groups in dialogue, a simple act of civility that succeeded in curbing the worst rhetoric. Companies can and must work harder — using all the tools at their disposal — to create an online culture that does not tolerate violence and hate.

The search of his apartment yielded other clues. “We can see that he had clothes related to right-wing groups, and we found some other things that pointed in that direction,” Mr. Gustafsson said in a phone interview. “It is too early to talk of a precise motive. The path to his becoming a killer is a long journey.”

The attack occurred as Sweden, like Germany and other European countries, has struggled to accommodate a wave of people fleeing conflict and deprivation. The killings occurred on the same day that the Swedish Migration Agency forecast that as many as 190,000 refugees would stream into the country this year — more than double previous forecasts.

David Brax, a researcher at the University of Gothenburg who studies hate crimes, said that since a school shooting in 1961 in Kungalv that killed one person and wounded six, he was not aware of another shooting at a Swedish school.

Swedes were left asking themselves how such a crime could have happened. The country is divided, Dr. Brax said, between those who see the attack as a terrorist or hate crime, and those who see it as the act of a single troubled man.

“The nation is in shock, and there is a lot of polarization,” he said.

Tensions were fanned over the summer when a woman and her adult son were fatally stabbed at an Ikea store in Vasteras, Sweden, and an Eritrean whose asylum request had been denied was charged with the crime. Fears of retaliation against immigrants followed.

Several refugee centers in the country have been set on fire in recent weeks, driving fears of an anti-immigrant backlash.

The far right in Sweden, as in much of Europe, has been gaining strength recently, in part, analysts say, because of fears about immigration. Sweden Democrats, a far right anti-immigrant party, drew almost 13 percent of the vote in a general election in September 2014, helping it become a potent political force in the country. But the center-left minority government and the opposition have both been extremely wary of joining forces with the party.

Dr. Brax said the attack came at a time of simmering resentment in some quarters against refugees and the strains they can place on the country.

“The arrival of large numbers of refugees has created a reaction in some places of ‘not in my backyard,’ ” he said, “while the far right has described immigrants as a cost to society, who can’t be integrated.”

For some in Sweden, Mr. Pettersson’s apparent targeting of immigrants brought back memories of another attacker, John Ausonius, nicknamed the “Laser Man,” who shot 11 people from immigrant backgrounds between August 1991 and January 1992 in Stockholm and elsewhere. One man died. In some of the attacks, which traumatized the country, Mr. Ausonius used a rifle equipped with a laser sight.",nytimes.com,True

A mock gallows appeared at an anti-immigrant rally last week, with labels indicating the nooses were intended for Ms. Merkel and her deputy, Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the Social Democrats. On Wednesday, the police reported that a mock gallows was erected last weekend some 400 yards from a migrant shelter near Magdeburg.

The actions and words have set off a level of concern that was not evident in Germany a year ago when a small but vocal anti-immigrant movement took hold in Dresden. At the time, the government appeared anxious not to draw attention to the group by discussing its activities, while pro-immigrant forces also turned out in force to counter the anti-immigrant sentiment.

But in the months since, more episodes of violence against migrants and migrant shelters have been reported in Germany than in any other European country — 400, or more than one attack a day on migrant shelters so far this year — with many occurring before tens of thousands of people from the Middle East and Africa began flooding in through Bavaria this summer.

The human wave, which could amount to a million newcomers this year, has taxed resources and the patience of many Germans, who are expressing growing anxiety over immigration policies, according to public opinion polls.

Many politicians are wondering how to accommodate the arrivals as they run out of buildings, temporary shelters and even beds. A letter signed by 215 mayors in North Rhine-Westphalia on Wednesday asked Ms. Merkel and the state governor, Hannelore Kraft, for help and said even the supply of tents was almost exhausted.

At the same time, Europe has failed to reach a common solution to stem or control the flow of people to the Continent. On Wednesday, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, summoned leaders from Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia to a meeting on Sunday to address the continuing flow of people through the Balkans, as temperatures drop and accommodations along the migrant trail through that region remain inadequate.

In Germany, the stabbing last Saturday of Henriette Reker, 58, a senior official responsible for welfare and thus migrants in Cologne, stunned Germans. Ms. Reker was stabbed several times in the neck during her last day of campaigning to become mayor of Germany’s fourth-largest city, and four other people were wounded.

Her assailant, a 44-year-old man, was identified by the police as someone with a far-right background. On Monday the federal prosecutor’s office, which took over the case, said that the accused “wanted to send a signal about what he sees as the ever increasing number of refugees admitted to the country.”

Within hours, politicians from all over the state, Germany’s most populous, held a vigil near Cologne’s cathedral. “We are showing that democracy stands together, across party lines,” said Ms. Kraft, the governor. “And that we do not permit violence to take effect.”

Officials drew a straight line between hateful language and violence.

“In Cologne, somebody felt called upon to do exactly what he gets to read every day” on social media, said Armin Laschet, a leader of Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats in North Rhine-Westphalia, where Cologne is.

The federal interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, on national television on Sunday called for Germans to spurn extremists spreading “poison” in the country. Justice Minister Heiko Maas has called on all Democrats to stick together.

But on Monday in Dresden, some 20,000 Germans rallied for Pegida, the anti-immigration, anti-Muslim group that emerged there a year ago. Its marches eventually attracted 25,000 people last winter before the group faded amid personal quarrels and unease at Hitler poses and anti-foreigner language on the web from the movement’s founder, Lutz Bachmann.

With the migrant crisis, however, the movement has garnered fresh attention, even if its appeal remains largely limited to Dresden and surrounding parts of rural Saxony. Defying Mr. de Maizière’s and the chancellor’s warnings to stay away, supporters flocked under heavy police presence on Monday evening to the city’s Theatre Square.

Mr. Bachmann told the crowd, “We came to stay, and we will stay to win.”

Even Mr. Bachmann, however, intervened and disowned a Turkish-German writer’s speech on his website, after the writer launched an attack on establishment politics. The writer, Akif Pirincci, asserted that the government wanted German critics of its migrant policy to leave the country, to which the crowd chanted, “Resistance, resistance!”

His speech was hard to understand as words echoed off darkened buildings around the square, but the German news media quoted the author as saying that, for the government, “there are of course other alternatives” to get rid of critics. He then was reported to have added: “Unfortunately, the concentration camps are closed right now.”

The authorities are investigating whether Mr. Pirincci is liable to hate-speech charges.

An estimated 15,000 Pegida opponents turned out in Dresden on Monday. Only the presence of almost 2,000 police officers from six German states prevented major clashes between the two groups.

Mr. Schuster, the leader of the Council of Jews, did not refer explicitly to Mr. Pirincci when in Thursday’s editions of the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel he appealed to the German authorities “to exhaust all legal possibilities to prevent rallies where calls to violence are issued.”

The attack on Ms. Reker showed, he added, “where all this can lead.”

Ms. Reker, an independent candidate backed by the Christian Democrats and two other parties, won Sunday’s mayoral election and the authorities said she would most likely make a full recovery.

A Jewish man who was mistaken for an Arab and stabbed by a fellow Israeli Jew bent on avenging recent knife attacks in Israel denounced ethnically motivated violence in interviews with the local news media.

Uri Rezken, the victim of the botched revenge attack, was stabbed in the back on Tuesday as he worked at a market in the Haifa suburb of Kiryat Ata.

“I’m working, and suddenly I feel four knife stabs in my back,” he told Israel’s Army Radio on Wednesday. “I heard a shout, ‘You deserve it, you deserve it, Arab bastards!’ When I turn around I see a Haredi man. I shouted to him, ‘I’m a Jew,’ but he tried to continue. I just ran away; otherwise I would have been killed.”

As Jessica Montell, an Israeli rights activist, noted, the victim also rejected the premise that his attacker’s confusion mattered at all. “If I were Arab, it still wouldn’t have been O.K. You shouldn’t stab anybody,” Mr. Rezken said.

Speaking from his hospital bed to a local news site, NewsHaifaKrayot.net, Mr. Rezken issued a plea for tolerance in comments posted Wednesday on YouTube. “We are all human beings, we are all equal,” he said.",nytimes.com,True

But the resort to live fire, often with lethal consequences, is increasingly opening Israel up to criticism, placing the government in a quandary.

Earlier Monday, a Palestinian man, Mustafa Khateeb, 18, from another East Jerusalem neighborhood, stabbed a border police officer at the Lion’s Gate entrance to the walled Old City. The officer was wearing a protective vest and was unharmed. Police officers fatally shot the assailant and were later praised by their superiors for their swift response.

Hours later, a Palestinian teenager from East Jerusalem stabbed a police officer near the national Police Headquarters, and the officer shot and wounded her. On Monday night, a Palestinian attacked a soldier with a knife and tried to grab his gun on a bus near Jerusalem’s central bus station. The assailant seized a pistol that a police officer on board dropped during the struggle, the police said; other officers arrived and fatally shot him.

Under domestic pressure, the Israeli government wants to project an iron fist in an effort to deter further attacks and to restore the Israelis’ shattered sense of personal security. Yet human rights groups, Palestinian activists and Arab members of the Israeli Parliament say that at least in some episodes that were caught on video, officers appeared to have acted too aggressively, firing at suspects who did not appear to be presenting any immediate mortal danger, and at times shooting to kill.

Some critics argue that too tough a reaction only pours gasoline on the bonfire, inspiring more attacks and protests that sometimes escalate into deadly clashes. Some of the videos of police shootings have had the added effect of turning the Israelis, in the eyes of some people, from the victims of terrorism into aggressors.

Israeli analysts say there are no easy answers.

“When somebody is standing with a knife, whether a man or woman, and threatens to stab you and your assumption is they intend to kill you, you want to protect yourself,” said Michael Herzog, a retired brigadier general and Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

“Clearly it is preferable to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice,” he said, “but you can’t control it. People are under psychological pressure.” Mr. Herzog added, however, that some cases might warrant further investigation.

Video of the shooting of Fadi Alon, 21, who stabbed and wounded a 15-year-old Jewish boy, Moshe Malka, outside the Old City on Oct. 4, appeared to show Mr. Alon being killed by the police as he was trying to flee from Israeli civilians who were pursuing him, shouting “Shoot him!”

Amnesty International, which has accused Israel of using excessive force, said that killing “appears to have been an extrajudicial execution.”

Ahmad Tibi, an Arab member of Israel’s Parliament, questioned why the police killed Mr. Alon but spared Yishai Schlissel, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish man who stabbed six marchers at a gay pride parade in Jerusalem in July before officers wrestled him to the ground. One of Mr. Schlissel’s victims, a 16-year-old girl, later died of her wounds.

Video of the shooting and wounding of an Arab Israeli woman wielding a knife at a bus station in the northern Israeli town of Afula has also raised doubts about the threat she posed.

The acting national police chief, Bentzi Sau, said open-fire regulations were based on “means and intention.” Noting that the woman in Afula was shot in the lower body, he said that she had been warned to drop the knife but failed to do so, meaning that the forces had to act to “neutralize the threat.”

Mr. Herzog said he had seen the Afula video. “The police panicked. It is hard to judge people in that situation,” he said.

An Israeli resident of Pisgat Zeev, who requested anonymity to avoid the attention of the police, said she had seen the shooting of the young assailant on Monday from a distance of a few meters. Police officers “jumped out of a van and started shooting,” she said. She could not see if the youth was holding a knife, but she said the police had acted too quickly to have given much warning.

“They fired at least 10 shots,” she said. “It’s like the Wild West here. This was overkill.”

And like many Palestinians who are skeptical of Israeli police accounts, relatives of Mr. Khateeb, the suspect from Lion’s Gate, said they found it hard to believe he had done any harm.

“They shot Mustafa for no reason whatsoever, like they have been doing to every other Palestinian lately,” said his aunt, Bakriya al-Khateeb Bakri, 44. “He had plans with my husband to go to Nablus on Thursday, pick up our daughters who study at Al Najah University and buy an entertainment system for his car.”

Feeding the anger, the Palestinian news media often denies that any attack took place.

Al Haq, a Palestinian human rights group, noted that under global standards the use of firearms “is permissible as an absolute last resort” against imminent threat of death or serious injury, and “only when other extreme measures are proven insufficient.”

Sarit Michaeli of the Israeli human rights group Btselem said, “On an immediate level, of course the police have an obligation to protect citizens. But they are expected to do so by using the minimum amount of force.” If necessary, the police could aim to shoot suspects in the leg, she said.

A Catholic mission in Carmel, Calif., was vandalized on Sunday, with statues toppled and paint splashed on walls, tombstones and doors, just days after an 18th-century friar buried there, Junípero Serra, was canonized by Pope Francis, the police and officials at the mission said.

Employees of the Carmel Mission discovered the vandalism inside the basilica’s entrance courtyard and said it appeared to have been done early Sunday morning, the mission said in a statement posted to Facebook.

“Apparently a person or persons broke in, splattered paint and toppled down the courtyard statue of St. Serra and other historic statues on display,” the statement said. It urged readers to pray that the perpetrators “take responsibility for their actions on this sacred property and that they seek reconciliation.”

The vandal or vandals toppled a bronze statue, snapping it off at the base, where they etched “terrible messages,” the mission said.

Supporters and family of Mr. Meek sat in the courtroom, some covering their faces with their hands, and declined to comment as they left. As Mr. Meek was led out, his father asked him, “Do you need canteen money?” to buy items from a jailhouse store.

Judge Hodges agreed to issue a warrant for Mr. Meek’s arrest on Tuesday, the same day that The State, a South Carolina newspaper, reported on its website that the federal government had warned Mr. Meek that he was “a potential target” of a criminal inquiry. The letter, dated Aug. 6, told Mr. Meek that the authorities were “investigating your conduct and possible criminal violations of federal laws,” and it included references to both misprision and false statements.

At first, Mr. Meek said, he did not take Mr. Roof seriously. Mr. Meek said that he eventually became worried enough that he hid Mr. Roof’s .45-caliber handgun, but that he returned the weapon, at the urging of his girlfriend, because he was on probation and did not want to get into trouble.

His lawyers have said that Mr. Roof would be willing to plead guilty in exchange for sentences of life imprisonment.

Mr. Meek appeared in court on Friday without having been interviewed by a probation officer, so Judge Hodges did not have the report that judges commonly use in deciding whether to set bond.

Jay Richardson, an assistant United States attorney, said that Mr. Meek had refused to be interviewed. Deborah Butcher, the lawyer representing him, said he had not refused, but wanted to consult a lawyer first.

But there have been many others, including one in Lunzenau in Saxony on July 29, when vandals broke into and deliberately flooded an empty shelter for 50 asylum-seekers by opening the taps in the bathrooms.

That same night, in nearby Dresden, a group of 50 people staged a demonstration against a tent city, hastily set up by the state to temporarily shelter hundreds of asylum-seekers. The Courage Against the Right group has counted 89 such demonstrations this year, many organized by local groups with names like Freital Defends Itself that have sprung up in cities and towns where empty office buildings and hotels have been converted into hostels for new arrivals.

Germany has also witnessed record numbers of people volunteering their time, clothing and money to help the newcomers, and the German government, both nationally and on the state level, has strongly denounced the attacks.

Still, the persistence of such attacks has human rights groups and security officials worried about the wider implications.

Gauri van Gulik, who monitors Europe for Amnesty International in London, said the group had seen a general increase in hate crimes directed against migrants in other European countries, but neither it nor any other group was able to provide solid statistics, in part because the laws vary by country. Germany, for example, has no laws against hate crimes, but counts rightist attacks as politically motivated crimes.

“In Germany, the language has been so classic neo-Nazi we immediately identify it with the types of crimes associated with the far-right,” Ms. van Gulik said.

Elsewhere, the rhetoric has been no more welcoming, and often the official policies are designed to push migrants away. Right-wing parties in Denmark are seeking to clamp down on the number of people coming in, while Hungary is pushing ahead with plans to build a 13-foot-high barbed-wire fence along its border with Serbia, despite criticism from its European Union partners.

But since a group called Pegida, the German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, grew from a cluster of friends into a movement, with organized demonstrations that attracted thousands to weekly marches through Dresden, German security officials have seen more attempts by neo-Nazis to use unease over the migrants to further incite hatred.

Since then the situation has calmed, but red-and-white police tape still flutters across the street from the hostel, which houses people from Albania, Morocco and Syria.

Abdel Wahir, 16, has been in Germany only three weeks. During that time, he has witnessed the country at both its best and its ugliest. His sister-in-law has received first-class medical care for an unspecified throat problem he said she developed on the trip here from Afghanistan. But he also witnessed angry protesters shouting racial slurs on the street outside the Leonardo, a former three-star hotel.

A leading television journalist, Anja Reschke, delivered a commentary on the public television network ARD denouncing Internet commentators who she said were helping to incite fear with hate-filled remarks. In the video, which went viral in Germany, Ms. Reschke encouraged Germans who are “not of the opinion that all refugees are freeloaders that should be hunted, burned or gassed” to make their opinion “very clearly known.”

For those like Abdel Wahir, who walked for months and paid smugglers to help him on his journey through Europe, even the angry demonstrations are not enough to encourage him to turn back or seek refuge elsewhere. He said he had not yet had time to learn German, but planned to begin once his application for asylum was accepted, so that he could go on to study and get a job. “Germany still good,” he said in halting English, a broad smile on his face.",nytimes.com,True

For days now, there has been an outpouring of outrage: Israel’s chief rabbis published a newspaper ad declaring, “Violence is not the way of our holy Torah.” Sheikhs and rabbis, as well as politicians from opposing camps, made joint pilgrimages to visit Ali’s badly burned mother and 4-year-old brother in the hospital. Security forces have also reinvigorated their pursuit of right-wing radicals.

There has also been a backlash. The leader of a group that harasses gays and Jewish-Arab couples was recorded declaring that “churches must be burned.” Posters honoring the man arrested after stabbing six people at the pride march — “We pray that all of God’s nation were as filled with awe as you” — appeared in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, where many consider homosexuality an affront to God. Death threats against the right-wing leaders who vowed vengeance against the arsonists have been posted on social media sites.

And there has been blame. Palestinians and leftist Israelis argue that Israel’s nearly half-century occupation of the West Bank and impunity for settler vandals inevitably led to Friday’s firebombing of the Dawabsheh home. Gay rights advocates cannot understand how the police failed to stop the man accused in the knife attacks, Yishai Schlissel, who had recently been released from prison for a similar attack at the 2005 pride march and had declared his intention to repeat it.

“Israeli society is embarrassed, because we know this is not who we are, it’s not who we want to think we are,” said Donniel Hartman, an Orthodox rabbi and the president of the Shalom Hartman Institute, a research and education group. “The interesting question for all of us is, ‘Is this going to be a growth moment or is it going to be another wasted Yom Kippur? Oh, we’ve sinned, and we feel so righteous for saying we’ve sinned.’

“I’m afraid there isn’t a context yet in which this could really create a societal change,” he added. “The core narrative in Israel is still an us-them, they’re-threatening-us narrative, and in an us-them, these are just moments.”

The attack on the Dawabsheh home may have more international significance; the Palestinian foreign minister raised it in a meeting this week with the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, reported. But for many in Jerusalem, the stabbing that killed young Shira was equally painful, highlighting the tension in a city where a third of the Jewish residents are ultra-Orthodox.

While Tel Aviv is celebrated for its gay nightclubs and same-sex couples pushing strollers, Jerusalem remains a place where gay and transgender youth must often choose between their orientation and their religious communities. It was only in 2012, after a decade-long court battle, that the Jerusalem Open House, which runs an H.I.V. clinic, support groups and a drop-in center, secured funding from City Hall. In the years between Mr. Schlissel’s attacks, the pride march has been marred by Orthodox protesters hurling epithets and bags of urine.

“There’s a very mainstream perception in Israel that gays shouldn’t live openly in Jerusalem,” said Tom Canning, Open House’s director of development. “This is not religious people, it’s also secular people. ‘Why are you marching in Jerusalem? Go to Tel Aviv, you have Tel Aviv.’ ”

Mr. Canning said that the group’s priority is to gain access to public religious schools for tolerance education, and that it pressed for this in a meeting Sunday with Naftali Bennett, the education minister, but “he didn’t make any promises.” Still, Rabbi Noa Sattath, who was chairwoman of Open House at the time of Mr. Schlissel’s first stabbing, said, “The reaction from the community is completely different.” At that time, a post-stabbing rally drew 150 people and “we couldn’t get one member of Parliament to come,” Rabbi Sattath recalled. At a rally on Saturday, Israel’s president spoke to a crowd of thousands, she noted, adding, “Our pain has become visible.”

The gathering in Zion Square, a bustling hub for tourists and Israeli teenagers alike, began spontaneously on Sunday after Shira, a pianist who had excelled at biology and theater at an elite Jerusalem high school, died of her wounds. Open House, the city government and other organizations then made efforts to turn it into a public shiva, the seven-day period of intense Jewish mourning, bringing in facilitators to lead structured conversations.

She has also had “confrontational dialogue” that she described as “raw and difficult and painful,” and “like witnessing revelation.”

“We have young ultra-Orthodox men coming, they’re coming because they’re actually curious, they want to meet a gay person,” Ms. Weil said. “We can pass laws and we can stage protests and we can write articles, but the way to open hearts and minds is to talk face to face.”

On Wednesday night, as Mr. Krueger crooned on the cobblestones, Noam Eyal, 30, whom Mr. Schlissel was also accused of stabbing in the back at the parade, was in the crowd. Uniformed Israeli soldiers leaned on the police barriers surrounding the circle, smoking cigarettes, next to a middle-age couple licking ice cream cones. Inside, someone had painted a new placard that read, “Our hands did not spill this blood,” adorned with red handprints.

Naftali Sirchuk, 20, in the signature white button-down, black pants and black-velvet skullcap of his yeshiva, sat for nearly an hour arguing with Nir Cohen, 30, and Vered Hoshmand, 29, who both have degrees in philosophy. They debated the difference, biblically speaking, between homosexual love and pedophilia. They dissected the gemarah, centuries-old rabbinical teachings. They spoke of the Holocaust and the death penalty and whether murder can ever be just.

Just the sight of Mr. Sirchuk engaging with Ms. Hoshmand, who wore a spaghetti-strap tank top and short jean skirt, was shocking in tribal Jerusalem. But after the conversation, did any of the three think differently?

And where are those settlers in their skull caps who instantly filled this square when demonstrations were held against the demolition of illegal settlements — but who are now choosing not to demonstrate against the murder of babies? Do they think that, when it comes to Palestinians and the L.G.B.T. community, the commandment “Thou shalt not kill” has been erased from their set of stone tablets? That we have some sort of division of labor here: The right demonstrates for the sanctity of the land, and anything related to murder of innocents who are not Jewish or straight falls completely outside their jurisdiction?

And what about all those who don’t really take an interest in politics, but simply live here and try to survive — do they also think that this demonstration has nothing at all to do with their lives?

It seems that we’ve all given up on the belief that we can change something here — the fact is that even the few who have come to the demonstration look tired. Many of them are sitting on the rim of the fountain and the steps of City Hall. Only a few have come to the demonstration on Saturday night, and even they don’t have the strength to stand. The speakers finished their speeches and the crowd began to disperse, but my son refused to leave.

To his mind, every person who believes that the murder of children and the stabbing of innocent people are wrong should come out to demonstrate against those acts.

Attempts by Israelis to use support for gay rights as a cudgel against Palestinian groups have misfired at times. In 2011, a gay Israeli man who claimed to have been discriminated against by pro-Palestinian activists was exposed as an actor after his false testimony had been shared online by government officials.

After Thursday’s attack, whose suspect is a religious fundamentalist from a Jewish-only settlement built on West Bank land Israel has occupied since 1967, Mr. Abunimah seconded the observation of a Canadian activist who speculated that Israel’s military would have destroyed Mr. Schlissel’s home had he been a Palestinian.

Uri Blau, an Israeli journalist, reported on his blog that the suspect, who was not on the radar of the police despite having been released from jail just weeks ago for a knife attack on the parade in 2005, had even distributed a manifesto calling for violence to prevent the “blasphemous” event.

According to Mr. Blau, the attack was also praised in comments posted on the Facebook page of Lehava, a Jewish extremist group that had demonstrated against the celebration as “an abomination” contrary to Scripture.

JERUSALEM — An ultra-Orthodox Jewish man who had recently been released from prison after serving 10 years for stabbing participants in the annual Gay Pride Parade here in 2005 struck again Thursday, stabbing six marchers in this year’s parade, according to the police.

Two of the victims were in serious condition, according to the emergency services. The assailant, Yishai Schlissel, was pinned to the ground on a central Jerusalem street and arrested by police officers who were stationed along the route, the police said.

Mr. Schlissel wounded three marchers a decade ago at a spot not far from Thursday’s attack and was convicted of attempted murder. He was said to have told the police that he had come “to kill in the name of God.” He was released from prison a month ago.

Jerusalem’s annual Gay Pride Parade has long stirred strong emotions in the city, with many Orthodox Jews objecting to the public display, saying that it defiles the city and offends many of its residents. An ultra-Orthodox news website referred to it on Thursday as “the Parade of Abomination.” There has also been criticism from Muslim and Christian quarters in the past.

Tribal officials have asked federal prosecutors to investigate the shooting as a bias attack. (Wyoming has resisted years of efforts to pass state-level hate-crime laws.)

Had the two men been white, tribal officials say, James Goggles, 50, a cousin of Dean Goggles, would not be lying in a hospital bed, and Stallone Trosper, 29, would not be dead.

Mr. Clyde told the police he had gone looking for “park rangers” — a local slur that tribal officials say refers to homeless Indians. Many of the people who drink in the parks are Native Americans, as are about 85 percent of the detox facility’s clients, according to local officials.

Riverton was carved out of the Wind River Reservation for white settlement in 1905, becoming a city apart where alcohol is sold and 80 percent of its 10,000 residents are white. Tribal and nontribal residents eat at the same restaurants, are married into one another’s families and play video slots side by side at Wind River Casino. But middle-age Arapaho leaders who grew up on the reservation, population 10,000, have childhood memories of “No Indians” signs in store windows.

Tribal leaders said the shooting was the latest entry in a troubling ledger. They pointed to the case of a gay Northern Arapaho member who was beaten to death by two teenagers in 2013 in what his mother later called a hate crime; and to the case of a Northern Arapaho woman complaining of a pain in her head who said she was turned away from a hospital after staff members there failed to observe that she had been shot. In 2010, tribal members won a voter-discrimination lawsuit against the county’s elections system.

In his ruling on the voting case, Judge Alan B. Johnson of Federal District Court wrote that “discrimination is ongoing, and that the effects of historical discrimination remain palpable.”

Days after the shooting, Northern Arapaho leaders met with elected leaders and law enforcement officials from the area to talk about what to do next. Richard Brannan, a tribal council member, said it seemed as if most of the non-Native American officials did not see the discrimination that the Indian leaders felt so viscerally. Tribal leaders and the Riverton mayor, Lars Baker, met to try to find common ground. But Mr. Baker said he was not sure what “common ground” really meant.

The shooting happened in what city officials and nonprofit workers described as a cinder block sanctuary for people struggling with alcohol and drug problems. James Goggles, “Sonny” to his friends and family, was a Navy veteran. Mr. Trosper was shy and kind, said his uncle George Abeyta, and was hoping to start community college to study political science.

“He wanted to get back on his feet,” Mr. Abeyta said. “He wanted to dry out.”

Mr. Clyde, the man charged with shooting them, had worked for the city’s parks department for about 13 years, mowing lawns and keeping things tidy, said Riverton’s police chief, Mike Broadhead. About a week before the shooting, friends of Mr. Clyde noticed a change in him that coincided with a tense run-in between a female parks employee and one of the “park rangers.”

After the shooting, Mr. Clyde unloaded his gun, took off his shirt and walked outside, arms raised in surrender, to wait for the police to come, the police said.

“It’s like he’s just a guy on a mission,” Chief Broadhead said. “It was like, mission accomplished.”

The residue of the shooting has also stretched across Riverton and back to the park where a cluster of people — some family, some friends — were drinking in the shade. They had started with mouthwash that morning, but by 3 p.m. had moved on to a plastic quart bottle of vodka.

This is not a hypothetical situation. Three years ago next month, a white supremacist walked into the Oak Creek gurdwara, a Sikh temple, and fatally shot my mother, Paramjit Kaur Saini, and five other worshipers.

I was 18 and just about to start college. My mother never got to see me off.

After her death, I determined to make sure that her status as a victim of a hate crime would not go unrecorded.

Wade Michael Page, the neo-Nazi who killed my mother, died at the scene of his crime by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, after being hit by police gunfire outside the gurdwara. Because of the massacre’s notoriety — the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr., described the killings as “an act of terrorism, an act of hatred, a hate crime” — a federal prosecution might have followed if Mr. Page had survived to stand trial.

Even without that intervention, though, he would have faced the more severe penalties attached to hate crime charges in a Wisconsin court. That matters because state hate crime laws represent the local public commitment to protecting communities that may be targeted for their race, religion or ethnicity.

Since the June 17 shootings in Charleston, at least eight predominantly African-American churches in the South have burned down — incidents that demand hate crime investigations. Many suspect that these fires were set deliberately in attacks designed to terrorize the African-American community.

Without a hate crime law, however, South Carolina would probably file only arson charges against any culprits. In addition, there is a clear reluctance on the part of law enforcement and local authorities to label these church burnings suspected hate crimes.

“You are raping our women and taking over our country,” Mr. Roof said to the victims, all of them black, before killing them, witnesses told the police.

While the shooting did bring new national attention to racial tensions, it did not have the effect that prosecutors say Mr. Roof wanted. Quite the opposite. The shooting renewed the national debate over the symbolism of the Confederate flag. South Carolina lawmakers responded by removing the flag from the State House grounds.

There are mixed views inside the Justice Department about whether prosecutors should try to bring the federal case before Mr. Roof stands trial in South Carolina.

Some said they believed it would be better to defer to local prosecutors, both because they have already started a case that they see as very strong, and because it avoids the lengthy federal process required when seeking the death penalty.

Speaking after the sentencing, Mr. Awad said he considered the sentence too light given the severity of Mr. Laufer’s threats.

“I don’t think the sentence will act as a deterrent for those who intend to target the Muslim community,” Mr. Awad said.

At the time of his guilty plea, Mr. Laufer was told that he could be sentenced to more than a year in prison and fined.

Mr. Laufer’s threats against Mr. Awad stemmed from his belief that the council was to blame for his being charged with attempted murder in the state case, prosecutors have said.

In November 2012, Mr. Laufer allegedly approached a 57-year-old man, identified as Bashir Ahmad, who was unlocking the doors to a mosque in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, and stabbed him with a knife while yelling, “I will kill you Muslim.”

Mr. Laufer was released on bail in that case.

The following October, Mr. Laufer sent the council an email, in which he provided his name, phone number and email address, threatening to destroy the organization, claiming it tried to set him up for the charge of attempted second-degree murder as a hate crime.

“You don’t know who you are messing with,” Mr. Laufer wrote.

Prosecutors suggested that Mr. Laufer was also responsible for phone calls the council received the same day as one of the threatening emails, in which the caller never spoke and gunshots could be heard just before the caller hung up.

At his federal plea hearing in March, Mr. Laufer said that he had exhibited symptoms of bipolar disorder or manic-depressive illness for 40 years and that he suffered from other depressive disorders.

“Mr. Laufer clearly needs medical treatment,” Alexander E. Eisemann, his lawyer, said on Tuesday after the sentencing hearing.

Much of Mr. Laufer’s federal case has revolved around details over where and how he would receive treatment for his mental illness.

Thumbing through a thick file, the prosecutor recounted statements to the police that the adult defendant, Mr. Ben-David, who was driving, had urged his young relatives to “finish him off” as they struggled with their captive in the back of the car. Then he asked, “Do you remember when Ben-David asked you for the crowbar?”

And in reference to the youth’s admission that he had doused the victim with gasoline, the prosecutor asked, “You wanted to wipe out the traces of DNA, right?”

The Israeli authorities have described the killing of Mr. Abu Khdeir as a revenge attack. It happened a few hours after Israel buried three teenagers — Eyal Yifrach, 19; Gilad Shaar, 16; and Naftali Fraenkel, 16 — who were hitchhiking home from their yeshivas in the West Bank when they were abducted and shot dead by Palestinians. Their bodies were found in a shallow grave near the West Bank city of Hebron after an 18-day search.

The kidnappings and killings prompted deep outrage, set off riots in East Jerusalem and contributed to an upward spiral of Israeli-Palestinian tensions and violence that led to the 50-day Gaza war last year.

The two Palestinian men who were suspected of abducting and murdering the three Israeli youths were shot dead by Israeli troops in a gun battle in September in Hebron. A third man was later arrested, tried and sentenced to three life terms by an Israeli military court.

But the Abu Khdeir case remains open and personal, as the two sides wrangle over the grisly details in the courtroom, with its low wooden benches and its noisy air-conditioning units whirring high on the walls.

As the prosecutor at the recent hearing questioned the teenage defendant accused of playing the more active role in events, the other teenager sat, thin and wan, on a bench across the room, separated from Mr. Ben-David by a prison guard. Both defendants were shackled hand and foot.

Three judges sat on a dais, and lawyers filled the front two benches. The victim’s parents, a sister and a cousin squeezed into the last bench by the back wall to observe the proceedings, together with a translator and some reporters. Other relatives came and went as seating space allowed.

“I said from the beginning that they would claim insanity,” he said of the defendants. “Now, you see, the older one is ‘insane,’ ” he said, referring to Mr. Ben-David, who has refused to testify. His lawyer says Mr. Ben-David was not mentally sound at the time of the killing and is not fit to stand trial; the court has yet to rule on that claim.

At times during the court session Mr. Ben-David closed his eyes and moved his lips silently. At others, he conferred in whispers with his lawyer.

“It’s all an act,” the victim’s father said. “They burned Muhammad once. Every day we are burned anew.”

The victim’s mother, Suha, compared the trial to a movie. “We come to watch,” she said, describing the defendants as “cowards.” “If we don’t get justice for Muhammad,” she said, “we will go to a higher court.”

The three defendants, all from Orthodox Jewish backgrounds, were arrested soon after Muhammad Abu Khdeir was killed.

Mr. Ben-David, a resident of Adam, a West Bank settlement, owned an eyeglass store in Jerusalem. The teenagers are from Jerusalem and the nearby Israeli town of Beit Shemesh; one was a student at a religious school, or yeshiva, and the other a yeshiva dropout working at a toy store. Mr. Ben-David and one of the youths have been treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder, among other illnesses, according to the indictment.

Mr. Ben-David and the yeshiva dropout are also charged with trying to kidnap an 8-year-old Palestinian boy in the same area of East Jerusalem the night before Mr. Abu Khdeir was killed. That abduction failed when the Palestinian boy’s mother shouted and struggled with the kidnappers and the boy escaped.

Israel’s internal security agency, the Shin Bet, said that while they were being questioned, the three defendants in the Abu Khdeir case admitted to the abduction and killing. The agency said the three also re-enacted the attack for investigators.

In court, the prosecution showed video images of the re-enactment, in which Mr. Ben-David was heard describing, among other things, how one of the teenagers held Mr. Abu Khdeir’s arms in the back of the speeding car while the other — the one on the witness stand — choked him to stop him from struggling.

Asher Ohayon, the public defender representing Mr. Ben-David, said in an interview that his client was unable to remember his actions that night, let alone justify them, and was in “a state of denial.” Mr. Ohayon said that his client had told investigators he did not understand how he could have committed such terrible acts and that he was ashamed and regretted what he had done.

The teenagers’ defense appeared to rest mainly on persuading the court that they did not know in advance that the night’s events would end with a killing and that they thought the plan was merely to give someone a beating.

The indictment says that the second teenager remained in the car while the victim was taken into the forest, bludgeoned and burned.

Investigators uncovered that information as they have pieced together where the gunman, Dylann Roof, 21, received his inspiration, and whether anyone else should face charges in connection with the murders.

“To understand what happened, you have to understand who he talked to and who may have known what,” said one law enforcement official briefed on the case. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing investigation.

So far, the authorities have determined that people around Mr. Roof were aware that he held some racist beliefs.

If the authorities find that any of Mr. Roof’s associates knew about his plans, they would most likely try to prosecute them. In the case of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, at least two men who were friends of the bombers were charged with helping them dispose of evidence from the bombing and from a subsequent shooting of a police officer. Three other men associated with the bombers were charged in connection with lying to the authorities or obstructing the investigation.",nytimes.com,True

“Lawrence felt at ease coming to the shop and saying things there that he didn’t say elsewhere, the air always pregnant with a ‘maybe.’ Maybe he was flirting. Maybe not. If he went too far, maybe that would be okay. Maybe he was being mocked. Maybe he was being entertaining. Maybe, just maybe. He knew the things he was saying were dangerous, because just being himself was dangerous. He was operating outside the rules.”

Others like Lawrence hid more or lived in repression more.

“But not Lawrence. He wouldn’t pretend. He wouldn’t hide.”

In the book I called him Lawrence, but that was not his name. One of my mother’s only requests was that I change everyone’s names. She was expressly worried about publishing “Lawrence’s” name. I acquiesced.

You see, more than a decade after I remember him coming to the upholstery shop, he was found murdered — tied to a bed — in a neighboring town. The gossip was that his life had been taken because of the way he had lived it. To my knowledge, no one was ever charged with that murder. Such were the dangers of being both black and different.

In a 1984 interview, when my cousin and I both still lived in that small town, James Baldwin was asked about the roots of homophobia. He responded: “Terror, I suppose. Terror of the flesh.”

But when living black gayness, or any similar otherness, in America, that terror of flesh is doubled. You are on the margins of the margin.

For, you see, even in gayness, blackness is set apart. As Baldwin put it:

“A black gay person who is a sexual conundrum to society is already, long before the question of sexuality comes into it, menaced and marked because he’s black or she’s black. The sexual question comes after the question of color; it’s simply one more aspect of the danger in which all black people live.”

Baldwin concluded:

“The gay world as such is no more prepared to accept black people than anywhere else in society.”

My cousin’s life and death underscored this duality for me:

“Five years after Lawrence was tied to the bed and killed, Matthew Shepard, a young, white, openly gay man, was tied to a fence and killed in a small Wyoming city. While Lawrence’s death hardly made the local papers, Matthew’s provoked an international outcry. That discrepancy would haunt me.”

My cousin’s name was Larry, and he was kind and beautiful and brave and worthy. That name, more than ever, deserves to be written, spoken, celebrated, not because he was famous or because he lived a remarkable life. It deserves to be spoken because he did not. His anonymity gives his name all the more power, because he could have been anyone.

Larry lived a kind of amplified erasure: black and nonhetero-normative. And, he lived it as boldly as he could at a time when it was dangerous to do so and in a place where there was little support or protection.

I wish that Larry had survived to see a time when the country was fighting to affirm both parts of his identity, fighting to acknowledge that his black life mattered and his love life mattered. I wish he had lived to see more people come to understand the intersectionality of oppression — that racism and homophobia are born of the same beast.

I wish he could have lived to proudly proclaim his difference and have his halves reconciled.

I wish he had lived to see the day that society — and indeed the law — didn’t attempt to diminish a person’s dignity based on how they articulated the parameters of their attraction or lived the reality of their intimacy.

I wish he had lived to see a black president eulogize a black man killed and also advocate for the full and rich lives that L.G.B.T.Q. people live. I wish Larry had lived to see Friday.",nytimes.com,True

But Justice Department and F.B.I. officials agreed that the Charleston shooting was so horrific and racially motivated that the federal government must address it, law enforcement officials said. South Carolina does not have a hate crimes law, and federal investigators believe that a murder case alone would leave the racial component of the crime unaddressed.

“This directly fits the hate crime statute,” one law enforcement official said. “This is exactly what it was created for.”

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.

The death penalty could be a factor in deciding who prosecutes; Mr. Roof faces possible execution under South Carolina law, and Gov. Nikki R. Haley has called for the death penalty. But the federal hate crime law carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.

Federal and state prosecutors could both bring charges, and in such instances, they typically coordinate so one case does not undermine the other. Officials said no decision had been made on the timing of charges because many details remained unresolved.

Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the federal investigation was continuing.

Mr. Roof has been assigned state and federal public defenders. In his sole court appearance since the shooting, in Charleston on Monday, bond was set at $1 million, which he has not posted.

“I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight,” read part of the 2,500-word online screed attributed to Mr. Roof. “I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the Internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.”

The F.B.I. laboratory in Quantico, Va., was analyzing a computer and phone that he used, the officials said, piecing together his communications and trying to recover any deleted information.

The killings took place on the night of June 17, when witnesses said Mr. Roof sat with a group of black people in a Bible study group at the church for almost an hour, then drew a .45-caliber pistol and fatally shot nine of them. “You are raping our women and taking over the country,” he reportedly said.

Among the dead was Mr. Pinckney, the church’s widely respected pastor. His body, clad in a dark suit and red tie, lay Wednesday in an open coffin between the House and Senate chambers, near a statue of John C. Calhoun, a staunch 19th-century defender of slavery and secession.

The line of mourners stretched from the domed lobby of the blue granite State House, down the green and gold stairway, around the marble floor, out a side door into the stifling heat, past the still-flying Confederate battle flag, around the grounds and up Sumter Street.

The viewing came two days after Ms. Haley, a Republican, called on lawmakers to remove the battle flag from the Capitol grounds. Both houses of the Republican-controlled General Assembly voted Tuesday to take up the matter.

Southern conservatives have often defended symbols of Confederate pride as emblems of heritage, not bigotry. But this week, conservatives like Ms. Haley have joined a sudden groundswell of officials calling for removal of Confederate flags and statues, and the rechristening of places named for Confederate heroes.

South Carolina moved the Confederate banner in 2000 from atop the Capitol dome to a pole near the building. That change was enshrined in law, so a new law would be needed to move it again.

But Mr. Bentley, Alabama’s governor, concluded that he could act on his own authority to remove the flags flying beside a Confederate memorial outside the Capitol building in Montgomery.

“He does not want the flags to be a distraction from other state issues, so he ordered them removed,” said Yasamie R. August, the governor’s press secretary.

In Mississippi, the Republicans who control state government have been split, with some saying voters should decide whether to keep the flag and others, including the United States senators from the state, supporting change.

“As the descendant of several brave Americans who fought for the Confederacy, I have not viewed Mississippi’s current state flag as offensive,” one of those senators, Mr. Wicker, said Wednesday. “However, it is clearer and clearer to me that many of my fellow citizens feel differently and that our state flag increasingly portrays a false impression of our state to others.”",nytimes.com,True

Lawmakers in South Carolina who voted against opening the placement of the flag to debate said they were concerned that the flag’s rushed removal would lead to the renaming of countless streets and the destruction of Confederate monuments that are strewn across the state.

“We want to proceed and make sure that we’re doing it properly and we don’t have unintended consequences,” said State Representative Craig Gagnon, who is originally from Lowell, Mass. — with forebears who fought for the Union — but represents a conservative district. “We don’t want to just trash everything and take everything away.”

He thought a good compromise would be to replace the battle flag at the State House with another flag from the Confederacy, one that had not become so associated with contemporary racist movements. Others were not inclined to talk compromise at all.

“You’re asking me to agree that my great-grandparent and great-great-grandparents were monsters,” said Greg Stewart, a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the executive director of Beauvoir, the last home of Jefferson Davis.

Mr. Stewart was livid at the “reckless and unnecessary” statement by Philip Gunn, the Republican speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives, that the Confederate battle saltire needed to be removed from the Mississippi state flag.

Here in South Carolina, members of the state division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans were not as fervent in opposition to their political representatives, but they did maintain that now was not the time to discuss moving the flag. While he insisted that hatred and racism had no place in the organization, Kenneth Thrasher, the lieutenant commander for the division, said in an interview that he could understand taking down the flag while the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a state senator and one of the nine killed in Charleston, was lying in state.

“But to permanently decide today is a little too fast,” he said. “The flag didn’t kill anybody. It was a deranged young man who did.” Mr. Thrasher said he could be agreeable to a compromise, like allowing the flag to fly in front of the state museum.

This sentiment was not universally well received among the membership.

“He should be knocking heads together instead of just laying down and rolling over,” said Harris Dail, a member who lives in Topeka, Kan., and who accused Mr. Thrasher of having “caved in with the rest of these brainwashed people” in a comment on the division’s website.

Those who sold Confederate goods said efforts to remove the flag from stores were based on a misunderstanding of its current meaning to many Southerners. Freddie Rich, the owner of RebelStore.com from Kings Mountain, N.C., which sells Confederate flags and bumper stickers (including one that reads, “I Believe the South Was Right, and I Don’t Believe in Slavery — Then or Now”) said his customers bought Confederacy-themed merchandise as an expression of regional pride and admiration for Civil War veterans.

“There’s nothing racial about it,” he said of the flag. “This is history to us.”

Still, it was a mixed day. With Walmart and Sears ceasing to sell Confederate merchandise, Mr. Rich said his store had around a 2,000 percent increase in sales in the last 24 hours. Told that eBay had also announced a ban, he let out a whoop.

Finally, there were some who were resigned to surrender.

In Austin, Tex., a tall bearded man went into the tattoo parlor where Kelly Barr works with a request: the removal of a 10-year-old tattoo of the Confederate flag.

He told Mr. Barr that he had decided to get the flag removed when he saw the pained look on a middle-aged black woman at his gym on Monday.

At times, she had defended the flag’s presence. During her initial run for governor, she said the flag was “not something that is racist,” but rather, “a tradition that people feel proud of.”

Ms. Haley was elected in 2010 on a cresting wave of Tea Party sentiment, and despite all of her firsts, she is more a product of American conservatism than the civil rights movement. Her focus as governor has been on aggressively promoting economic development more than addressing historical racial wrongs — although her supporters argue that her job-creation efforts have helped all people.

But last week’s killings have, at least for now, upended the political status quo in South Carolina. They have thrust Ms. Haley into the national spotlight, and into uncharted political territory here at home, where she now finds herself leading her party to align, on the matter of the flag, with liberals and blacks with whom she has clashed over many policy issues.

Ms. Haley said her decision to take a stand on the flag was an “emotional” one that she hoped would help heal her state. She spoke of her pride in the way South Carolinians have rallied across the racial divide.

“The South Carolina I am privileged to lead today is not the South Carolina I grew up in,” she said. “It has continued to change and it has continued to evolve. It is the people who have done that.”

In the hours before the interview, the Legislature passed a procedural measure that will allow it to consider removing the flag from the State House grounds while lawmakers meet in special session this week.

But victory is not assured. In her news conference Monday, Ms. Haley, who was elected to a second term last year, said the flag was a “deeply offensive symbol” for some. She was also careful to acknowledge the many whites here who view the flag as means of honoring the Confederate dead. “That is not hate,” she said, “Nor is it racism.”

Her language demonstrated the delicate political balance that she and other Republicans navigate in a state where the flag is still revered in some circles.

Yet as the drama unfolds on shifting political terrain, Ms. Haley finds herself in a familiar place: somewhere between the Southern binary of black and white.

She was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa in Bamberg, S.C., a small city between Columbia, the capital, and Charleston. Her parents were immigrants from India’s Punjab State. She has said the locals often did not know what to make of the family’s Indian heritage. When she was about 5, Ms. Haley and her sister entered a “Little Miss Bamberg” pageant, where, traditionally, a black queen and a white queen were crowned. The judges decided the sisters fit neither category, so they disqualified them.

Ms. Haley began working for the family clothing business at an early age, and eventually received an accounting degree from Clemson University. She was elected to the state House in 2004, defeating Larry Koon, a longtime incumbent and fellow Republican. Ms. Haley was the subject of racial attacks during the campaign. Even her name became an issue, with Mr. Koon pointing out that she was enrolled to vote as Nimrata Randhawa.

In the House, she earned a reputation as a fiscal hawk. In 2009, she declared she was running for governor, winning an endorsement from Sarah Palin, the former Republican vice-presidential candidate and Alaska governor. In the midst of the primary, two Republicans operatives emerged, making separate and unproven accusations that they had had sexual encounters with her. Ms. Haley, who was by that time married, strongly denied the assertions.

A Republican state senator, Jake Knotts, also went on a radio show and called her a “raghead.” The governor said Democrats, too, dealt insensitively with her, noting that State Representative Gilda Cobb-Hunter once said that voters did not think of her as a minority, but as “a nice conservative woman with a tan.”

Ms. Haley handily won the primary and went on to defeat her Democratic challenger, State Senator Vincent Sheheen, 51 percent to 47 percent.

In office, Ms. Haley focused squarely on efforts to recruit companies to South Carolina, luring them with a combination of tax incentives, the state’s anti-union environment, and a willingness, her admirers say, to work the phones like a telemarketer and sell South Carolina to out-of-state chief executives.

But some of Ms. Haley’s positions angered many African-American leaders, including her support of a law requiring voters to show identification cards at the polls, and her refusal to expand Medicaid under President Obama’s health care law. In 2013, Ms. Haley removed a member of her re-election campaign’s advisory committee after it was revealed that the member had ties to the Council of Conservative Citizens, a group that opposes “all efforts to mix the races,” and whose writings resonate in an online manifesto apparently written by Dylann Roof, who has been charged in the killings at Emanuel A.M.E. Church.

During her 2014 re-election bid, her team said that more than 56,000 jobs had been created in, relocated to, or promised for South Carolina since she took office. When asked about the Confederate flag at the time, she said that the chief executives she spoke with did not think it was really an issue.

Ms. Haley’s new stand on the flag may raise her national stature, allowing her to distance herself from a symbol that many are finding increasingly indefensible. Bakari Sellers, a former Democratic state representative who is African-American, said the governor’s national profile had waned somewhat after her election in 2010, but that her stand on the flag had “catapulted her back into a national discussion.”

The governor is often mentioned as a potential presidential running mate or future cabinet member. But Mr. Sellers said he did not think politics motivated her on Monday.

Whereas the previous government sought a widespread ban on the wearing of all religious symbols by public servants, the premier said, the so-called religious neutrality bill now under consideration would be much narrower. It would only prohibit female civic or provincial employees who have face-to-face dealings with the public from wearing the conservative Muslim attire that covers faces.

“The role of the government is to draw a line in the sand,” Mr. Couillard said. “This issue of face covering for me has very little to do with religion, and a lot to do about the image of women, the status of women in our society. Showing your face is the essence of communication.”

He said the other proposed piece of legislation in Quebec, concerning hate speech, was necessary to strengthen legal protections against the targets of violence incited by words.

A draft of the legislation would assign powers of investigation and punitive action, including fines and identification on a publicly available list, to a Human Rights Tribunal, which would determine whether a person had engaged in or disseminated hate speech that incited violence.

The premier said refinements in the bill would be worked out in Quebec’s legislature.

“You can say you don’t like this community, don’t like this people, but there’s a limit that can be reached in society,” he said. “There is no such thing as an absolute right. Calling people to violence is something that cannot be accepted.”

Mr. Couillard, who is also a neurosurgeon, was visiting New York as part of a mission promoting Quebec as an environmentally progressive place to do business, with enormous hydropower resources.

The province has been a leader in the so-called cap-and-trade system for emission allowances, which began two years ago. It basically sets a price on carbon emissions in a way that creates a market of buyers and sellers of credits for low emissions and encourages reductions. Last year, Quebec linked its system with California’s.

An outspoken supporter of efforts to combat global warming, Mr. Couillard acknowledged his differences on the issue with Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Mr. Couillard said the federal authorities had not impeded Quebec’s policies.

Haley’s call on Monday to have the Confederate battle flag removed from the State House grounds. But also skepticism — Ms. Lee, for one, says she doubts whether the Republican-led legislature will indeed vote to remove the flag.

What is clear to most is that the everyday issues that most affect people’s lives go far beyond what happens with a flag.

The complications of race in Charleston are all around Ms. Lee’s neighborhood, where small, peeling clapboards quickly give way to polished, towering Craftsman-style homes, and hipster restaurants sit near simple corner stores.

About a block from Ms. Lee’s home is Burke High School, the only public high school in downtown Charleston that is not a magnet or charter. Founded in 1894 as a vocational training school for Charleston’s black children, Burke has a proud history as a bastion of African-American learning through the days of Jim Crow. The oldest victim of last Wednesday’s massacre, Susie Jackson, 87, was a Burke graduate.

But even after desegregation came in the 1960s, and even as the community around Burke has changed over the past quarter-century — the city went from 41 percent black in 1990 to 25 percent in 2010 — the school has remained 98 percent black. About 85 percent of its students are eligible for free or reduced lunch.

It is struggling academically — a state report card ranked it below average last year (though supporters note that its students tested better than those at most other schools in the county with similar demographics). The school’s population in grades seven to 12 has dwindled by about 200 over the past five years to 446, even though its massive modern building can hold roughly three times as many students.

Now the future of the school is at the center of a fierce debate caught in racial crosscurrents. While most agree that the academics need to be bolstered, there are divisions over how to go about doing so.

At a recent forum to discuss Burke’s future, Ms. Lee, a medical records supervisor, said some black families expressed a fear of the motives of new white residents and what the changes could mean for the school’s rich African-American heritage. “They’re in the neighborhood,” she recalled people saying. “They want to change the school.”

Todd Garrett, a Charleston County School Board member who lives near Burke, said it seemed that some advocates thought that Burke was a school exclusively for the African-American community.

“As long as the leadership and the faculty have that belief or attitude that anybody else coming in is an outsider and is trying to take our school, there’s not a lot of hope in it ever changing,” he said.

Mr. Garrett, who is white, said there was “absolutely no racial component to not wanting to send our kids to Burke.” Rather, he said, he was concerned with the school’s academic performance.

But Barbara Dilligard, the president of the Burke High School Foundation, said that misperceptions about the quality of the school and its students had scared away not only new white families, but also middle-class minorities. Ms. Dilligard said she wanted the school to become more diversified while maintaining its legacy with the black community. She said she hoped that the racial unity in the wake of the shooting would help bridge some of that divide.

“But what we also have to recognize is that while we do the things we are doing now because of a tragedy, let’s not forget that when the tragedy is over, the problems that created that tragedy still exist,” she said.

Several Charlestonians said they were skeptical about whether the shooting would spur meaningful action to address racial disparities in things like housing, education and police treatment.

“Next year’s an election year — of course it’s going to seem as though it’s a wake-up call,” said Antoine, a 32-year-old black convenience store owner here who asked that his last name not be used so as not to attract unwanted attention. “But is it really? Why did it take this to be a wake-up call? Why couldn’t it be a wake-up call when that bombing happened in ’63? When something else happened prior to that? Or at the end of slavery, why wasn’t it a wake-up call then?”

Wearing a T-shirt that read “Stop Killing Us” on the front and “Black Lives Matter” on the back, Bianca Green pondered where this city was going as she stood on the porch of the squat low-rise apartment where her friends live, part of a predominantly black complex across the street from Burke.

“This is going to wake everybody up,” said Ms. Green, 24, who works at a McDonald’s. “Life is too short. What you going to do? Either we going to hate each other or love each other. I’d rather everybody love each other because too much things happening, too much people dying. It’s senseless.”

This is the kind of city that responds to tragedy in ways that outsiders might not expect, she said. People actually started coming together a couple of months ago after Walter Scott, a black man, was fatally shot in the back by a white police officer in North Charleston, Ms. Green said.

“Us down here, this is not a state that we start riots and all kinds of things,” she said. “This is a peace-loving state.”

Still, there are challenges that disproportionately affect minorities, as Ms. Green has experienced firsthand. About six months ago, she moved out of her apartment in West Ashley, a community west of downtown, as the landlord was roughly doubling the rent to $900 a month. The landlord was making improvements like repainting the buildings, installing air conditioning and fixing the roof, Ms. Green said. But there were a lot of older adults on fixed incomes who would not be able to afford the change, she said.

Ky Coffman and Will Allport, a white couple who moved into a duplex near Burke four years ago, said that it was difficult to see people getting displaced and that it was probably contributing to tensions in the neighborhood. But with the shooting touching on issues of race, guns and religion, they said they were hopeful that it would start a meaningful conversation.

“I don’t think that there’s one thing that can fix it,” said Ms. Coffman, 27, as the couple walked their beagles, Effie and Lola. “I think there’s gun control, there’s mental health laws, there’s community development, funding for schools in underprivileged neighborhoods. All these things, I think, are going to play a factor, and I think that’s why it is such a complex issue, that there’s probably not going to be one thing that fixes it.”

The Rev. Alonza Arthur Washington, a community activist, said he thought that people would be drawn to the ballot box as the shooting and other episodes raised issues of racial disparity. It was time, he said, to work on closing the gap between rich and poor, through measures like expanding Medicaid and paying low-wage workers more. He also said he hoped that gun control would be addressed.

“We must always remember our past, but that does not mean we must let it define us,” Mr. Gunn said in a statement that stunned many in Jackson, the capital, and was seen as adding a highly fraught issue with statewide elections there this year. “As a Christian, I believe our state’s flag has become a point of offense that needs to be removed,” Mr. Gunn said.

For decades, images of the Confederacy have been opposed by people who viewed them as painful symbols of slavery, racism and white dominance, and supported by those who saw them as historical emblems from the Civil War, reminders of generations-long Southern pride. Yet the new calls, after the church massacre last week, came with surprising force and swiftness. The demands straddled lines of partisanship and race, drawing support even from Southern conservatives who for years had defended public displays of the flag as a matter of regional pride. The movement also reached far beyond the political sphere, and beyond the South itself.

In Minnesota, activists demanded that a lake named after John C. Calhoun, a senator and vice president from South Carolina who was a proponent of slavery, be renamed. Amazon and eBay announced on Tuesday that they would no longer allow the sale of Confederate flags and similarly themed merchandise, joining Walmart and Sears, which had already done so. And messages were painted on Confederate statues in Charleston; Baltimore; and Austin, Tex., that read: “Black Lives Matter.”

“To see all of this happening, all of a sudden, it speaks of some fundamental change in the country,” said Kerry L. Haynie, a political scientist at Duke University. “It is surprising in the sense that there have been calls for this for years. But it took this tragedy to spur this type of change.”

Dylann Roof, 21, the white man from South Carolina charged in the shootings during a Bible study last Wednesday inside Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, had espoused a white supremacist philosophy, his friends said, and posed for photographs with the Confederate battle flag. The massacre combined with those images of Mr. Roof helped set off the nationwide re-examination of Confederate symbols.

On Tuesday, the vote in the South Carolina legislature was procedural, allowing lawmakers to consider a bill, not yet introduced, in the coming weeks. But in a legislature that had previously resisted passionate calls to remove the flag, its passage by huge margins was a watershed. Senator after senator invoked the memory of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, a pastor and state senator who was killed in the church. His Senate desk was draped in black cloth, a single white rose atop it.

The motion to consider a bill on the flag carried by a unanimous voice vote in the Senate, though one senator, Lee Bright, a Republican, said he would vote against removing the flag. In the House, the vote to take up the flag issue was 103 to 10.

“Our ancestors were literally fighting to keep human beings as slaves, and to continue the unimaginable acts that occur when someone is held against their will,” said State Senator Paul Thurmond, a Republican, explaining that he would vote to remove the flag.

“I am not proud of this heritage,” said Mr. Thurmond, the son of Strom Thurmond, the former governor and United States senator who was a segregationist candidate for president in 1948.

Yet as proposals emerged to remove Confederate imagery in state after state, members of Confederate veterans’ organizations voiced concern about the flood of demands and said they felt misunderstood. The Confederate statues, the battle flag, even the naming of streets were a matter of remembering family members who had fought in the Civil War, they said.

“This is a feeding frenzy of cultural cleansing,” said Ben Jones, the chief of heritage operations for the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a Tennessee-based group. “It’s an hysteria — we just want to fly this flag for family, for Grandpappy. This whole thing is basically insulting and demeaning our respect for our ancestors.”

Some opponents of removing all Confederate symbols from public places also tried to draw a distinction between flying the battle flag at a capitol, and displaying a statue or naming a park to commemorate individual soldiers. “People are calling for removing monuments and boulevard names in the name of racial sensitivity? Where does this end?” said Mr. Jones, who was a member of the United States House of Representatives and an actor on “The Dukes of Hazzard” television show. “This is just dividing people like crazy.”

Efforts to remove images came from both parties, and some Republicans were among the most outspoken, including Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina. In Tennessee, Gov. Bill Haslam, also a Republican, favors ending specialty plates with Confederate symbols and would not choose to keep a statue of Forrest in the Capitol given the limited number of Tennesseans honored there, his spokesman said.

Ryan Haynes, the Republican Party chairman in Tennessee, said that if he were asked to vote on the Forrest statue, he would choose to remove it, even as he warned Democrats against using it as a campaign issue.

“But at the end of the day, there are much bigger issues in Tennessee and in the Capitol,” he said in an interview. “What’s disturbing to me is that there are members of the Democratic Party who are seeking to use a tragedy to lead to distracting issues when we have big questions like education reform and job growth.”

The president of the Kentucky State Senate, Robert Stivers, a Republican, said in an interview that in light of the Charleston killings, he believed that a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy and a native Kentuckian, should be removed from the Capitol rotunda in Frankfort. The statue is near a larger one of Abraham Lincoln, a proximity that made him uncomfortable, he said.

Leaders in Washington, too, weighed in. Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the minority leader, called for the Confederate flag to be removed from the grounds of the South Carolina State House, but declined to take a position on the mascot of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas: the rebel, whose nickname is “Hey Reb.”

“I believe that the Board of Regents should take that up and take a look at it,” Mr. Reid said at a news conference.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the majority leader, also suggested that the Jefferson Davis statue should be moved.

“I think it’s appropriate, certainly in Kentucky, to be talking about the appropriateness of continuing to have Jefferson Davis’s statue in a very prominent place in our state capital,” he said. “Maybe a better place for that would be the Kentucky History Museum, which is also in the state capital.”

In Mississippi, where Mr. Gunn, the House speaker, has called for dropping the Confederate flag from the state flag and all but one statewide elected officeholder is Republican, not everyone was lining up with him. In 2001, political leaders there led an unsuccessful effort to replace the flag, which has been in use since 1894. In a referendum, 64 percent of Mississippi voters favored keeping the flag.

On Tuesday, the state’s lieutenant governor, Tate Reeves, asserted in a statement that the violence in Charleston should not be linked to a flag. “What happened in Charleston is simply pure irrational evil,” he said. “There is no other description for this monster’s actions. He is an individual that has allowed his mind and soul to be horribly twisted and disfigured by irrational hate. No symbol or flag or website or book or movie made him evil — he was evil on his own.”

A police official identified the man as Tyrelle D. Shaw, whom detectives were seeking in connection to the assaults this month in Manhattan. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the police had not yet notified the man’s relatives.

The end of white rule in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa, they believe, foreshadowed an apocalyptic future for all white people: a “white genocide” that must be stopped before it’s too late. To support this view, they cite the murders of white farmers in South Africa since the end of apartheid.

In recent years, extremists have distilled the notion of white genocide to “the mantra,” parts of which show up on billboards throughout the South, as well as in Internet chat rooms. It proclaims “Diversity = White Genocide” and “Diversity Means Chasing Down the Last White Person,” blaming multiculturalism for undermining the “white race.” The white nationalist American Freedom Party has made the mantra’s author, a segregationist from South Carolina named Robert Whitaker, its vice-presidential candidate in 2016.

White supremacists across the country, some displaying the apartheid South African flag, have participated in “White Man Marches” to raise awareness of the so-called white genocide.

Europe has also seen the rise of a powerful, far-right political movement that rejects multiculturalism. The anti-Semitic Jobbik Party in Hungary and the neo-fascist Golden Dawn in Greece are prime examples. In Germany, there has been a series of murders by neo-Nazis. Britain, too, is experiencing an upswing of nationalist, anti-immigrant politics.

The leader of a white supremacist group that apparently influenced Dylann Roof, the suspect in the killing of nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church last week, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republican campaigns, including those of 2016 presidential contenders such as Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Rand Paul, records show.

Mr. Cruz, a Texas senator, said Sunday night that he would be returning about $8,500 in donations that he had received from the Texas donor, Earl Holt III, who lists himself as president of the Council of Conservative Citizens.

“We just learned this evening that Mr. Holt had contributed to the campaign,” a spokesman for the Cruz campaign said in an email to The New York Times. “We will be immediately refunding all those donations.”

Mr. Paul’s campaign said Monday that it planned to send $2,250 received from Mr. Holt to a victims’ fund set up in the wake of the shooting.

“RandPAC is donating the funds to the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund to assist the victims families,” said Sergio Gor, a spokesman for the campaign. Mr. Holt made four separate donations to the Paul campaign last year, records show. The campaign could not confirm the total received but said that all the money it identified from the white supremacist leader would be donated to the fund.

The Guardian first reported on Mr. Holt’s donations to the Republican contenders.

A manifesto that appeared on a website registered to Mr. Roof said that the manifesto’s author had first learned of “brutal black-on-white murders” from the Council of Conservative Citizens’ website.

Mr. Holt, in a statement posted online in his name, said he was not surprised to learn that Mr. Roof had found out about “black-on-white violent crime” from his group because, he said, it was one of the few that had the courage to disclose “the seemingly endless incidents involving black-on-white murder.” But he said his group does not advocate violence and should not be held responsible for the shootings.

Spokesmen for Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, and Mr. Paul, a senator from Kentucky, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the donations.

This was a savage act of barbarism by a young man baptized in a theology of race hate.

There are so many threads to pull on this story that one hardly knows where to begin, but let’s begin here: Roof was only 21 years old. He is a millennial race terrorist. Roof was born in 1994, 30 years after President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law.

He had a white power flag fetish. He was once pictured wearing a jacket emblazoned with an apartheid-era South African flag and another flag of “Rhodesia, as modern-day Zimbabwe was called during a period of white rule,” according to The Times. Apartheid ended the year Roof was born, and Rhodesia became Zimbabwe long before that.

Who radicalized Roof? Who passed along the poison? We must never be lulled into a false belief that racism is dying off with older people. As I’ve written in this space before, Spencer Piston, an assistant professor of political science at Syracuse University, has found that “younger (under-30) whites are just as likely as older ones to view whites as more intelligent and harder-working than African-Americans.”

Racism is to social progress what cockroaches are to nuclear fallout — extraordinarily resilient.

Furthermore, there is a widely published photo of Roof sitting on his car with an ornamental license plate with Confederate flags on it. That is the same Confederate flag that flies on the grounds of the state Capitol. What signal is South Carolina sending?

There is the thread of couching his cowardice as chivalry, framing his selfish hatred as noble altruism in defense of white femininity from the black brute. So much black blood has been spilled and so many black necks noosed in the name of protecting white femininity, and by extension, white purity. Roof is only this trope’s latest instrument.

Then there is the question of whether to call this terrorism. Terrorism, as commonly defined, suggests that the act must have some political motivation. (By defining it this way, we conveniently exclude that long legacy of racial terrorism as a political tool of intimidation and control in this country.) And yet, this case may even reach that bar.

Reuters reported Friday that the case “is being investigated by the Justice Department as a possible case of domestic terrorism.” But whether it reaches the legal definition of domestic terrorism (it has already passed the common sense definition), some conservatives have even been reticent to call it a hate crime, which it surely is, rather preferring to twist this massacre into their quixotic crusade to establish evidence of a war on Christianity in this country.

On Fox News’s “Fox and Friends,” one host called the killings “a horrifying attack on faith.”

Another anchor on the show chimed in, responding to the comments of a guest: “Extraordinarily, they called it a hate crime. Uh, and some look at it as, ‘Well, it’s because it was a white guy, apparently, and a black church,’ but you made a great point just a moment ago about the hostility towards Christians. And it was a church! So, maybe that’s what they’re talking about. They haven’t explained it to us.”

Oh Fox, there is so much that needs explaining to you. First, Roof was a member of a Lutheran church in Columbia, S.C. As Rev. Tony Metze of St. Paul’s Lutheran Church confirmed to the Huffington Post, “He was on the roll of our congregation.” Lutheranism is one of the branches of Protestant Christianity.

Mr. Roof’s friends say that he only spoke of his murderous plans once — when he recently warned that he planned to do something crazy with the gun he had purchased with the money he got from his parents for his 21st birthday.

The website, the lastrhodesian.com, which was not working by Saturday afternoon, featured a photo of a bloodied dead white man on the floor. The picture appears to be an image from “Romper Stomper,” an Australian movie about neo-Nazis. The domain name is a reference to the white minority of what is now Zimbabwe, where whites fought blacks for 15 years and enlisted white supremacists as mercenaries.

The site was first discovered by a blogger who goes by the pen name Emma Quangel, who paid $49 for a reverse domain search that turned up the site.

According to web server logs, the manifesto was last modified at 4:44 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, the day of the Charleston shootings, and the essay notes, “at the time of writing I am in a great hurry.”

In the manifesto, Mr. Roof writes: “The event that truly awakened me was the Trayvon Martin case. I kept hearing and seeing his name, and eventually I decided to look him up. I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was. It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right. But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words ‘black on White crime’ into Google, and I have never been the same since that day.”

The manifesto also says he learned from the website of the far-right Council of Conservative Citizens. The council is an offshoot of a 1950s-era organization that fought school desegregation. A message on its website says the group is “deeply saddened by the Charleston killing spree.”

A friend of Mr. Roof’s, Jacob Meek, 15, said the references to the Trayvon Martin case made it clear that Mr. Roof had written the essay. “That’s his website,” he said. “He wrote it, and I just can tell.”

Watchdog groups that track right-wing extremism say the manifesto reflects the language found in white supremacist forums online and dovetails with what has been said about Mr. Roof thus far — that he had self-radicalized, and that he did not belong to a particular hate group. “It’s clear that he was extremely receptive to those ideas,” said Mark Pitcavage, the director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. “At the same time, he does not have a sophisticated knowledge of white supremacy.”

Mr. Roof was the latest in what watchdog groups say is a growing group of lone-wolf extremists. According to a study released in February by the Southern Poverty Law Center, about 70 percent of the 60 recent domestic terrorism attacks reviewed were conducted by people acting alone.

The writings on Mr. Roof’s website show a fixation with black-on-white crime, which is common on white supremacy sites, said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project.

“They demonize blacks to position themselves as victims, and offer that as proof of why they need their own state,” she said.

In one photograph posted on the website, Mr. Roof is shown posing with wax figures of slaves. In others, he posed with a handgun that appears to be a .45-caliber Glock. He had a .45-caliber Glock in his car when he was arrested Thursday, the police said.

The website’s links contain several passages of long racist rants, in which he said Hispanics are enemies, and “Negroes” have lower I.Q.s and low impulse control. The manifesto praises segregation and says the author’s reading of “hundreds” of slave narratives indicates that almost all slaves gave positive accounts of their lives. The manifesto uses defamatory terms for blacks, whom he accused of being “stupid and violent” with “the capacity to be very slick.” It laments white flight, and suggested that the whites should instead stay behind in cities and fight.

Criticisms are also levied at Jews, but Asians are praised for being racists and potential allies.

To the Editor:

Re “Charleston Massacre Suspect Held as City Grieves” (front page, June 19):

I wept as I read about the events in Charleston. And now young Dylann Storm Roof, who sports the predictable white-supremacist insignia and paraphernalia, has been captured. He will presumably stand trial.

But I want to know: Who taught him to believe that members of a certain group are justifiable targets of an irrational rage? Who taught him that a gun and a pocket full of bullets can ever resolve anything?

How many of our country’s proud Confederate flag flyers will own up to their part in creating a climate of racial intolerance? How many of our uncompromising Second Amendment supporters will stand with him and own up to their responsibility?

To the Editor:

The shooting of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney and eight others in the sacred place that is the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is shocking beyond belief. While I am certain that most of the good white folks of Charleston will apologize for a heinous act that they had nothing to do with, I remember a time of fear and cross burnings in the South Carolina of my youth when the same people also apologized.

The problem is not with the apologist. It is with us. All of us. How is it that with all of the racial progress we have seen in South Carolina, and in America in general, racism is alive and in our midst? How do we get past it?

The A.M.E. Church was founded in 1816 by the Rev. Richard Allen, who sought to create a place where free blacks could worship and where slaves could find a measure of dignity. The assailant in Wednesday’s massacre deprived those killed of the sanctuary for blacks that the church’s founder had worked so hard to establish.

Belin III heard about the mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S. C., he felt heartbroken. But he was not surprised that a racist gunman had set his sights on a historic black church.

“You attack the center, whatever you think is going to hit at the heart,” said Mr. Belin, the pastor of the Bethel First A. M .E. Church in Harlem, who rallied several hundred mourners this week for an evening prayer vigil in solidarity with the parishioners. “The black church has been the heart.”

All across the country, black congregations of all sizes mourned this week, communing in impromptu prayer services, in phone calls and on Facebook and on Twitter where people regardless of religious affiliation declared, #IamAME.

“It’s like a jog of the memory of how our sacred places have become places of violence toward us,” said Juone Darko, an adjunct professor at George Mason University, who grew up in Birmingham and attended a memorial service at Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington on Friday.

“They are sacred to us, but they aren’t seen as sacred to people who want to do us harm,” she said.

Even at a time of waning attendance, the church remains an important institution for African-Americans. In 2014, 79 percent of African-Americans identified themselves as Christian, a religious-affiliation rate that has dipped in recent years but remains higher than that of any other ethnic group, according to the Pew Research Center.

In Pew’s most recent study of church attendance, which was conducted in 2009, 53 percent of African-Americans reported attending religious services at least once a week, compared with 39 percent of Americans overall.

And churches continue to extend their mission beyond Sunday services, as they have since their founding.

In the 19th century, these centers of worship, small and large, rural and urban, stone and ramshackle, became vital community engines. More than 100 of the first black men to be elected to legislative office in the United States were ministers, according to Eric Foner, a Columbia University history professor known for his expertise in the Reconstruction era.

During segregation, churches became places where black men and women found leadership opportunities denied to them by white society. Some, though not all, became springboards for politicians and headquarters for protest movements, most recently in connection with the issue of police brutality.

That churches may not be vociferously political today does not mean that they are not doing the daily work of sustaining black people within their communities, said Barbara D. Savage, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “Your Spirits Walk Beside Us: The Politics of Black Religion.”

She pointed to large suburban megachurches, with middle-class memberships that form investment clubs and engage in small-scale economic development projects, and older urban churches that raise money for school uniforms and scholarships for young people.

The deacons of small clapboard churches that dot the Southern countryside have become soldiers in the fight to improve public health, organizing walking clubs and healthy potlucks in places ravaged by heart disease and diabetes. And churches still serve as efficient communications hubs, as evident from the political figures who shuffle in an out of pews at election time. In New Orleans, black churches became channels to share information when residents were scattered and their homes destroyed by the floodwaters after Hurricane Katrina.

“It’s not just African, it’s not just American, it’s not your run-of-the-mill religious experience,” said the Rev. Dwight Webster, of the Christian Unity Baptist Church in New Orleans, who lamented what he described as the falling away of young people. “It’s what was needed to help a people survive.”

Heidi Beirich, director of the intelligence project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said hate groups remained keenly aware of the church’s significance.

“It’s a symbol of the black community,” she said. “If you want to harm black folks, it’s an obvious easy target.”

Even as the church has evolved, racial violence has been a perennial companion. The killing of the four girls in Birmingham still lingers in memories. But it was only one of more than 300 such church bombings in the 1960s, according to “Black Church Arson in the United States 1989-1996,” which appeared in The Journal of Ethnic and Racial Studies in 1999.

The violence continued. From 1989 to 1996, more than 200 black and multiracial churches in the country were burned, according to a congressional hearing held in 1997, the article said.

“What is beyond question is that we are facing an epidemic of terror,” Deval Patrick, who was then an assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said in 1996.

The shooting in Charleston this week has resurrected some of those fears. On Friday, church leaders reported a bomb threat at Metropolitan A. M. E. Church in Washington. Other pastors said they were contemplating hiring security guards.

That Dylann Roof, the accused gunman, was welcomed at one of the church’s small informal gatherings — a midweek Bible study — and that some relative of the victims offered him forgiveness afterward is part of what makes the tragedy so searing.

“I think it’s a conversation that we’re going to have,” said State Senator Tom Davis, a Republican who represents Beaufort County in the Legislature. But he added: “Nothing is going to happen simply within the walls of that chamber without the people making their voice heard. There’s a sense in the institution itself that this issue was resolved.”

For years, the flag flew above the State House dome. In 2000, state officials, pressured by a business boycott led by the N.A.A.C.P. and large protests in Columbia, decided that only the American and South Carolina flags would fly above the State House, while the Confederate battle flag would be placed in front of the building.

This week, after the killings of nine people at a Bible study class at the Emanuel church, Gov. Nikki R. Haley ordered the American and South Carolina flags lowered for nine days — one day for each of the victims — but could do nothing about the height of the Confederate standard.

South Carolina law gives only the Legislature power to make changes to the Confederate battle flag display, and they must be approved by supermajorities in both the House and the Senate.

After years of being thwarted, opponents of flying the Confederate battle flag said this time there may be enough public outcry and rage to compel legislative action.

“I think that what we’ve seen in South Carolina is another act of terrorism, and this act of terrorism reminds us of a history of terrorism enacted against African-American people, particularly in the South,” said Russell Moore, a descendant of Confederate veterans who heads the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. “I think there’s momentum now to say we’re going to do everything we can to love each other and to work together, and that means getting rid of images of division. I do think the flag will come down.”

But even as Mr. Moore expressed confidence and lawmakers discussed plans to file legislation seeking to remove the flag from the State House’s grounds, many others cautioned that any shift in policy faced difficult odds in the Legislature.

“It’s a total lose-lose issue,” said David Woodard, a political science professor at Clemson University and a longtime Republican consultant. “You’re not going to make any friends by doing it, so you just leave it be.”

He added: “That’s a sad thing, but that’s the way it will have to be because I don’t see anyone who’s willing to take it on. There’s no politician who’s powerful enough to take it on.”

That included, he said, Ms. Haley, who told CBS on Friday that she expected a new round of debate in Columbia, the capital.

“I think that conversation will probably come back up again,” the governor said. “What we hope is that we do things the way South Carolinians do, which is have the conversation, allow some thoughtful words to be exchanged, be kind about it, come together on what we’re trying to achieve and how we’re trying to do it. I think the state will start talking about that again, and we’ll see where it goes.”

Senator Lindsey Graham told CNN that he would support a move to “revisit” the flag’s status, but he added that the flag was part of the state’s identity.

A Winthrop University poll last fall found that 62 percent of South Carolina residents had positive or neutral feelings toward the flag. But the poll’s director, Scott H. Huffmon, said Friday that he expected to see the results change in the future.

“Most people, based on past numbers, just want to put it behind them,” Dr. Huffmon said. “But given what has happened this week, I think people that are completely O.K. with the flag would likely — and I have no data to prove this — be O.K. with taking it down given the impact it has on others.”

Supporters of the Confederate battle flag display signaled Friday that their position had not changed. In a commentary on Friday, Michael Hill, the president of the League of the South, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has listed as a hate group, said that the Confederate battle flag should remain at the State House but that the American flag should be removed.

The American flag, Mr. Hill wrote, “now stands for multiculturalism, tolerance and diversity — the left’s unholy trinity.” In “sharp contrast,” he wrote, the Confederate battle flag “stands for the heroic effort our people made 150 years ago to avoid the fate” of contemporary America.

Other supporters of the flag said they view the two issues — the mass shooting and the flag — as unrelated. Dan Coleman, a spokesman for the Georgia division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, said the attack had more to do with “one very troubled young man” than the flag.

“It’s a shame that those people were killed, and we all greatly regret that incident, and we were upset that anybody would try to tie people who are proud of their heritage to an act like that,” he said.

Still, in Charleston, much of the talk was about change, even if it was unclear whether the conversations would bring it about.

“Surely, this is the time that that discussion needs to be had and had at a much higher octave than it’s been done in many years,” Dot Scott, the president of the Charleston chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. said before Mr. Brooks spoke here. “There’s been a renewed time and an opportunity to have that discussion.

“Even the crazy people, they don’t go into church,” he said.

Mr. Graham visited the church Thursday evening, quietly making his way there with a bouquet of lilies, bowing his head, and offering a short prayer. “For comfort and healing and understanding to those who have suffered in a way that most of us can never imagine,” he said.

He spent Friday morning shuttling around town for television interviews, making himself a presence on screens throughout the city. Later, his aides sent him a list of the victims’ families for him to call. And Friday evening, he arrived at a prayer vigil here, greeting residents who had come to mourn with handshakes and hugs.

In the process, he also grappled with the racial history of his state, which in many ways he himself embodies. He did not have an African-American classmate until middle school, and said he did not experience full integration until high school.

The importance of the end of segregation, he said, could not be overstated: “It’s not just for a black family to go to a better school,” he said. “It’s for white kids at an early age to understand that merit and leadership are not unique to one group.”

And in an e-book he recently released, he recalled growing up underfoot at his parents’ bar, which sold beer to anyone of legal age but for many years expected black patrons to drink it off premises. “That eventually changed, but not until the early seventies, much later than it should have,” he wrote.

He said he thinks he has earned some credibility among South Carolina’s black communities by being open to working with Democrats, and supporting some of Mr. Obama’s nominees, like Loretta E. Lynch, a black woman, who is now attorney general. Yet during his Senate re-election campaign last year, he won just 6 percent of the state’s black vote.

On Thursday, Mr. Graham set off a social media firestorm when he said during an interview on “The View” that 21-year-old Dylann Roof, the accused gunman, had been targeting Christians, rather than black Americans.

But on Friday morning, he clarified when asked, saying he believed it was a racially motivated hate crime. “The only reason these people are dead is because they’re black,” he said.

Later, Mr. Graham described Mr. Roof as “a racial jihadist.”

He also fielded questions about the Confederate flag, demurring when asked if he believed it should continue to fly on the grounds of the State Capitol. He was fine revisiting the issue, he said, but it was a decision for the State Legislature.

Pressed as to whether he viewed the flag as a symbol of hate and racial intolerance, as many do, Mr. Graham referred to Mr. Roof and said, “When I see it on that guy’s car, I do.”

On the question of gun control, he said he welcomed a debate on background checks for guns, but that the current background check system was broken.

“We’ll talk about guns, we’ll talk about the flag, we’ll talk about anything you want to talk about, but we’re going to bury these people with dignity, we’re going to honor their memory,” Mr. Graham told one television reporter.

But throughout it all, Mr. Graham could not seem to shake the question: How could someone enter a church, attend a Bible study, an then open fire, killing nine people?

He kept coming back to it — when former Senator Saxby Chambliss called him to offer condolences and when he set out Friday morning, the temperature sliding past 80 degrees before the sun was even ripe in the sky.

The night before, over dinner — his usual fried green tomatoes and fried chicken livers at Magnolias— Mr. Graham wondered again and again, what it must have been like to learn that your loved one had gone off to Bible study and was not coming home.

The horrific church shooting in Charleston, S.C., leaves the nation at an all too familiar juncture — uncertain whether to do something positive to repair society’s vulnerabilities or to once again absorb an intolerable wound by going through what has become a woeful ritual of deep grief followed by shallow resolve to move on toward … what? Toward the inevitable carnage next time.

The factors emerging in the mass murder of the nine churchgoers, who took the shooter into their prayerful midst, are a confluence of some of the nation’s most glaring problems: the empowerment of a steady stream of enraged people exercising their easy right to bear arms; the odious racism that haunts society’s darkest corners; and the public’s general sense of impotence, as needed solutions are left up to a political system undermined by retrograde and timorous officials more interested in their own survival than in the broader welfare.

The details emerging on how the suspected shooter might have been inspired by the white supremacy movement are another warning that the nation’s long history of racial brutality is far from healed. How much black lives matter was the question posed during the recent police shootings of African-Americans. This question is posed anew, in most grotesque fashion, in Charleston. Honest and creative answers are possible, but only if the American people — white and black — are galvanized to force politicians to make tangible improvements that go beyond vigils and speeches.

Anyone who has been to modern, progressive Charleston would be struck by a visit to its old slave market. This museum, which recounts historic abuses from a time when black people were chained as chattel, rings with the truth of how elusive full racial accord remains in America. The state’s nostalgic but poisonous flaunting of Confederate flags from a war that was waged over the issue of human bondage adds insult to the historic injuries still felt.",nytimes.com,True

The statements offered a moment of grace in a day when new details emerged about a massacre that has stunned the nation, echoing a long history of racial violence.

“All the victims were hit multiple times,” the Charleston Police Department wrote in an arrest warrant released Friday. The gunman walked in wearing a fanny pack, the statement said, and sat with the group talking Scripture for nearly an hour before he drew a gun and began firing — and on his way out, stood over a surviving witness “and uttered a racially inflammatory statement.”

After the police released security camera images of the suspect outside the church, Mr. Roof’s father and an uncle contacted the Charleston police and positively identified the defendant and his vehicle as those they saw in the photographs, the warrant revealed.

Charleston’s Shifting Population The racial makeup of Charleston shifted drastically over the last three decades. In 1980, blacks made up nearly half of the city’s population.

Mr. Roof, 21, who is white, was charged Friday with nine counts of murder, punishable by death, and one count of criminal possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. Law enforcement officials said that after he was arrested on Thursday in Shelby, N.C., he told investigators he had just done something big in Charleston, and the pistol believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered from his car.

Joseph Meek, a friend of Mr. Roof’s, said that his parents each gave him $350 toward the purchase of the gun, which he bought this spring, and that at some point they took it away from him. There have been reports that his parents gave him the gun directly, as a 21st birthday present, but Mr. Meek said Mr. Roof made a point of buying it himself so that his parents would not be implicated in any trouble he might get into.

Friends said Mr. Roof voiced virulently racist views and had talked recently about starting a new civil war — even about shooting black people. Photographs of him wearing patches with the flags of the former white supremacist governments of South Africa and Rhodesia, and leaning against a car with Confederate States of America on its license plate, drew millions of views online.

Gov. Nikki R. Haley, a Republican, was one of many officials to label the shootings a hate crime, and called for the death penalty in the case.

Laws in South Carolina and other states allow victim statements in certain criminal court proceedings, a product of the victims’ rights movement of recent decades. But it is unusual for that right to be invoked in something as mundane as a bail hearing, and the words spoken Friday by the survivors were rarer still.

Thousands of Charleston residents filled the TD Arena at the College of Charleston for an interfaith evening prayer vigil, suffused with expressions of Christian faith, the history of slavery and civil rights in the city and the state, and a collective resolve.

But the evening was also about the families of the victims, who were asked to stand and receive applause from the audience. Mr. Riley announced that funds were pouring in to help families with funerals, for maintenance of the historic Emanuel A.M.E. Church and to help low-income people living in South Carolina’s Lowcountry region.

Mr. Riley did not speak directly about gun control, but he said, “We do not want to live in a country where we need a security guard for Bible study.”

Smaller expressions of grief, both organized and impromptu, played out across the city.

In court on Friday, Magistrate Judge James B. Gosnell Jr. set Mr. Roof’s bail at $1 million on the gun charge, but explained that he did not have the authority to set bail on the murder charges, which would be handled by the state’s Circuit Court. The defendant watched impassively on a video link from a nearby jail.

The judge drew mixed reactions for another statement from the bench when he stated that Mr. Roof’s family were also victims in the case. The family released a statement Friday saying, “Words cannot express our shock, grief, and disbelief as to what happened that night,” but gave no insight into the defendant’s state of mind or racial views.

Witnesses said the gunman specifically asked for the church’s well-known pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was also a state senator, and sat next to him in the Bible study. First he listened, they said, then he argued, and eventually he began ranting against black people, until finally, he stood, drew a gun and fired, reloading as many as five times.

He fatally shot six women and three men, ranging in age from 26 to 87. Among the dead was Mr. Pinckney.

Mr. Roof had an unsettled personal life — he had been arrested twice this year, and friends said he sometimes slept in his car — and a recent history of antiblack views. But law enforcement officials said he was not on their radar as someone who posed a serious threat of violence.

In downtown Charleston, there was talk of the long-term anxiety the shooting might stir.

“The question that I have is, is it going to happen again?” said Jeremy Dye, 35, a taxi driver and security guard from North Charleston who said he knew three of the nine victims of Wednesday’s shootings. “It’s always going to be fear.

Conservatives would caw — they always do — and say, get over it, don’t play the race card. Liberals would complain that a simple apology did not go far enough, unless it entailed reparations for the descendants of slaves. But words of contrition — a formal acknowledgment of a grievous wrong by a great nation — have a power all their own.

The British, the Vatican, the Germans and the South Africans have all issued formal apologies for their official cruelties, and each case has had a cleansing, even liberating effect. The United States Congress apologized to African-Americans for slavery in 2009, though it came with a caveat that the mea culpa could not be used as legal rationale for reparations.

And President Bill Clinton, while in Africa in 1998, apologized for the slave trade, but not for a government that institutionalized white supremacy during its first four score and change.

He could also elevate the current discussion on race, which swirled earlier this week around the serial liar Rachel Dolezal, and the race-baiting billionaire vanity blimp of Donald Trump.

The slaughter of worshipers in a church with long ties to fighting slavery and Jim Crow “raises questions about a dark part of our history,” President Obama said Thursday.

From the time the first Africans arrived as slaves in Jamestown in 1619 through the codification of blacks as three-fifths of a person in the Constitution and up to the eve of the Civil War, when four million people were held in bondage, slavery has been the most incongruent element of a people proclaiming to be enlightened.

The definition of terrorism is a shifting and contentious subject, usually with political overtones. The antagonists in the Syrian war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for example, routinely accuse each other of terrorism. Militant organizations such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, which consider themselves liberators, are officially regarded by the United Nations, among others, as terrorist groups.

Webster’s New World College Dictionary defines terrorism as “the use of force or threats to demoralize, intimidate and subjugate, especially such use as a political weapon or policy.”

Civil rights advocates said the Charleston attack not only fit the dictionary definition of terrorism but reflected a history of attempts by the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups to terrorize African-Americans.

To the Editor:

As someone who has frequently visited Charleston, I am devastated by the killings at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Any mass shooting brings revulsion and anger, but the people killed Wednesday night, particularly the pastor of this church, represent the best of Charleston.

They were people who, through their church and its history, helped lead the city, and by extension our nation, away from racism and toward a better future for everyone, black and white. These are losses that cannot be made up. These are people who cannot be replaced.

It looks to be a random hate crime, and whether that turns out to be the case or not, it is still a tragedy. We should wait, however, before making judgments until more facts come to light.

The church where these shootings took place was burned to the ground in the pre-Civil War era and then met in secret for years because of white hostility toward it and black-oriented churches in general. Many major civil rights leaders of the 20th and 21st centuries have spoken there, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It stands as a symbol of survival through the long period when racism was not merely tolerated, but also part of official government policy.",nytimes.com,True

LEXINGTON, S.C. — The Facebook profile picture chosen by Dylann Storm Roof in May is thick with symbolism. It shows Mr. Roof, a scowling young white man, wearing a black jacket adorned with two flags — one from apartheid-era South Africa, the other from white-ruled Rhodesia — that have been adopted as emblems by modern-day white supremacists.

Mr. Roof, 21, was arrested Thursday in North Carolina after law enforcement officers identified him as the suspect in the mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, S.C., on Wednesday night. The shooting left nine dead, including the pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney.

Officials said the shooting was being investigated as a hate crime. Although it was not clear if Mr. Roof had actually joined any organized white supremacist groups, people who knew him said that in recent months, a young man they described as extremely shy had begun to harbor racist views and make increasingly violent statements about attacking black people.

Joseph Meek, 20, a childhood friend who reconnected with Mr. Roof this year, said Mr. Roof had changed, spewing racist ideas and talking about wanting “to hurt a whole bunch of people.”

“He was saying all this stuff about how the races should be segregated, that whites should be with whites,” Mr. Meek said. “I could tell there was something inside him, there was something he wouldn’t let go. I was trying to tell him, ‘What’s wrong?’ All he would say was that he was planning to do something crazy.”

Video

At first Mr. Meek said he did not take Mr. Roof seriously. But he became worried enough that several weeks ago he took away and hid Mr. Roof’s .45-caliber handgun, which Mr. Roof had bought with money given to him by his parents for his 21st birthday. But at the urging of his girlfriend, Mr. Meek returned the weapon because he was on probation and did not want to get into trouble.

Now Mr. Meek and his girlfriend, Lindsey Fry, both of whom are white, say they feel guilt about the shooting. “I feel we could have done something and prevented this whole thing,” Ms. Fry said.

Asked why Mr. Roof picked that particular church, Mr. Meek replied, “Because it was a black church.”

Another friend, Dalton Tyler, said that Mr. Roof had begun talking about wanting “to start a civil war.” But like Mr. Meek, he did not always take Mr. Roof seriously.

Mr. Tyler said on another occasion, the two were driving to a strip club by the zoo when Mr. Roof saw a black woman, used a racist word and said, “I’ll shoot your ass.”

“I was just like, ‘You’re stupid,’ ” Mr. Tyler said. “He was a racist; but I don’t judge people.”

Video

Mr. Roof has had two previous brushes with the law, both in recent months, according to court records. In February, he attracted attention at the Columbiana Centre, a shopping mall, when, dressed all in black, he asked store employees “out of the ordinary questions” such as how many people were working and what time they would be leaving, according to a police report.

When a police officer questioned Mr. Roof, he “began speaking very nervously and stated that his parents were pressuring him to get a job,” but then admitted that he had not asked for applications at any of the stores, the report said.

Asked if he had any contraband, Mr. Roof said no, according to the report, but the officer searched him and found Suboxone, a prescription drug used to treat opiate addiction and frequently sold in illegal street transactions. Mr. Roof admitted that he did not have a prescription for the drug, the report said, and he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor drug possession. The case is pending.

In April, Mr. Roof was charged with trespassing at the same mall. The police report said he had been barred from the mall for a year after the drug arrest. Mr. Roof was convicted on that charge, a misdemeanor.

Mr. Roof’s current address is listed in public records as being in this rural speck of a town southeast of Columbia with an overwhelmingly black population. On Mr. Roof’s Facebook profile, which was taken down Thursday, many of his 88 friends were black. More than half a dozen cars from the Richland County sheriff’s office were parked along the dusty driveway outside the two-story wood-frame home in Eastover. A man in a straw hat came out of the house and told a reporter: “Make your way right back where you came from. Get off the property now.”

From school records, Mr. Roof appears to have moved back and forth as a child between Richland County, which includes Columbia and Eastover, and nearby Lexington County to the west. He attended ninth grade twice: at White Knoll High School in Lexington in the 2008-9 school year and, the next school year, at White Knoll until February 2010, when he transferred to Dreher High School in Columbia. Neither school district had records of his finishing high school.

A neighbor in Eastover, Debra Scott, 50, said that she had seen Mr. Roof walking to and from a nearby market but that she knew very little about him or anyone else who might live in his house. She described the house as “very quiet” and said Mr. Roof “seemed like a normal kid.”

But Ms. Scott, who is black, said she was “scared to death” after hearing news reports that Mr. Roof wanted to kill black people. “My concern is that he’s saying he’s out to kill black people,” she said, unaware that he had been arrested. “We’re the closest ones to him.”

She added that her grandmother had called her Thursday morning and told her: “Get out of that bed. That boy was from Garners Ferry,” the name of the street where she and Mr. Roof lived.

Mr. Meek said that as a child, Mr. Roof would sometimes sleep over at his house. He described Mr. Roof as so quiet and shy that “his mom pushed him out of the house and told him to make friends.” He added, “Every friend he made, I made for him.”

Mr. Roof dropped out of high school after the ninth grade, Mr. Meek said, and the two fell out of touch. But this year, Mr. Roof sent him a Facebook friend request and the two got together again, often to go drinking or to strip clubs. Mr. Roof liked vodka and water, Mr. Meek said, adding, “I never saw him with a girl.”

He said Mr. Roof worked in landscaping and seemed to live an itinerant life, sometimes sleeping in his car. In recent weeks his behavior turned more bizarre, as he talked about wanting to burn an American flag and get his neck tattooed with the word “dagger.”

The friends last saw Mr. Roof on Tuesday when Ms. Fry found him sleeping in his car parked on a sandy patch in front of Mr. Meek’s house. Asked if she considered that odd, Ms. Fry replied, “He does weird things all the time.”",nytimes.com,True

Israeli leaders condemned the attack. “Such terrible desecration of an ancient and holy place of prayer is an attack on the very fabric of life in our country, where people of different faiths seek to live together in harmony and mutual tolerance and respect,” President Reuven Rivlin told the Rev. Gregory Collins, the leader of the Order of St. Benedict in Israel, which runs the church, according to a statement from Mr. Rivlin’s office.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, “This morning’s outrageous arson attack on a church is an attack on us all. In Israel freedom of worship is one of our core values and is guaranteed under the law.”

One of the monks assigned to the church, the Rev. Matthias Karl, said there had been more than 50 attacks against Christian institutions in Israel over the past three years, including damage to cars and cemeteries. “There is somebody, or a group of extremists — a small group, but an active group — who work against Christian people,” he told Israel Radio.

Mosques in Palestinian villages in the West Bank have also been the target of arson attacks by Jewish extremists in recent years.

CHARLESTON, S.C. — The mass murder of nine people who gathered Wednesday night for Bible study at a landmark black church has shaken a city whose history from slavery to the Civil War to the present is inseparable from the nation’s anguished struggle with race.

Fourteen hours after the massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, in which the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the church pastor and a prominent state senator, was among the dead, the police in Shelby, N.C., acting on a tip from a motorist, on Thursday arrested Dylann Storm Roof, a 21-year-old white man with an unsettled personal life and a recent history of anti-black views.

The killings, with victims ranging in age from 26 to 87, left people stunned and grieving. Witnesses said Mr. Roof sat with church members for an hour and then started venting against African-Americans and opened fire on the group.

At Morris Brown A.M.E. Church here, blacks, whites, Christians and Jews gathered to proclaim that a racist gunman would not divide a community already tested by the fatal police shooting in April of an unarmed African-American, Walter Scott.

“We cannot make sense of what has happened, but we can come together,” declared the Rev. George Felder Jr., pastor of New Hope A.M.E. Church.

Gov. Nikki R. Haley fought back tears, her voice trembling and cracking, at a news conference here. “We woke up today, and the heart and soul of South Carolina was broken,” she said. “Parents are having to explain to their kids how they can go to church and feel safe, and that is not something we ever thought we’d deal with.”

President Obama, once again having to confront the nation’s divisions, saw systemic issues of guns, violence and race in the tragedy in Charleston.

“We don’t have all the facts, but we do know that, once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun,” he said at the White House.

Video

And quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. after four black girls were killed in the bombing of a black church in Birmingham, Ala., 52 years ago, he said the lessons of this tragedy must extend beyond one city and one church. He cited Dr. King’s words that their deaths were a demand to “substitute courage for caution,” and urging people to ask not just who did the killing but “about the system, the way of life, the philosophy which produced the murderers.”

Even amid calls here for calm and compassion, at least three bomb threats were made Thursday that forced the evacuation of buildings around Charleston, including churches where prayer vigils were being held for the shooting victims. And while the racially mixed crowds inside those churches linked arms and appealed for harmony, the tone among some black people gathered on the city’s streets was not so conciliatory.

Jareem Brady, 42, said the shooting was only an extension of what black people face daily. “We’re not worth the air they don’t want us to breathe,” he said of Charleston’s white citizens.

The church holds a special place in the history of Charleston and particularly of its African-American population. It has the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore, according to the National Park Service, and its website calls it the oldest A.M.E. church in the South. The church’s current Gothic Revival building was completed in 1891, but the congregation dates to before 1820.

Of those killed, the most prominent was the church’s leader, Mr. Pinckney, 41.

“He was very gentle,” Mayor Joseph P. Riley said. “He spoke thoughtfully and deliberately. He had a big job, because that’s a big, important church.”

Mr. Pinckney was holding a Bible study session with a small group on Wednesday when, surveillance video shows, the suspect arrived after 8 p.m. — a slight, blond man with a bowl haircut and a gray sweatshirt. He sat down with the others for a while and listened, then began to disagree with others as they spoke about Scripture, said Kristen Washington, who heard the harrowing story from her family members who were at the meeting and survived.

Witnesses to the killings said the gunman asked for the pastor when he entered the church, and sat next to Mr. Pinckney during the Bible study.

They said that almost an hour after he arrived, the gunman suddenly stood and pulled a gun, and Ms. Washington’s cousin Tywanza Sanders, 26, known as the peacemaker of the family, tried to calmly talk the man out of violence.

“You don’t have to do this,” he told the gunman, Ms. Washington recounted.

The gunman replied, “Yes. You are raping our women and taking over the country.”

The gunman took aim at the oldest person present, Susie Jackson, 87, Mr. Sanders’s aunt, Ms. Washington said. Mr. Sanders told the man to point the gun at him instead, she said, but the man said, “It doesn’t matter. I’m going to shoot all of you.”

Mr. Sanders dived in front of his aunt and the first shot struck him, Ms. Washington said, and then the gunman began shooting others. She said Mr. Sanders’s mother, Felicia, and his niece, lay motionless on the floor, playing dead, and were not shot.

The gunman looked at one woman and told her “that she was going to live so that she can tell the story of what happened,” said City Councilman William Dudley Gregorie, a friend of the woman and a trustee of the church.

“She is still in shock, the carnage was just unbelievable is my understanding,” he said. “One of the younger kids in the church literally had to play dead, and it’s my understanding that my friend might have also laid down on top of him to protect him as well.”

The gunman left six women and three men dead or dying, including a library manager, a former county administrator, a speech therapist who also worked for the church, and two ministers. Greg Mullen, the Charleston police chief, called it a hate crime, and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said the Justice Department was investigating that possibility.

In a photo on his Facebook page, a glowering Mr. Roof wears symbols of two former white supremacist governments — the flags of apartheid-era South Africa, and of Rhodesia, the nation that became Zimbabwe. Other photos, posted by a Facebook friend of his and widely circulated online, show Mr. Roof leaning against a car with a license plate that reads, Confederate States of America.

The tragedy had a particular resonance in a city that offers perhaps the sharpest contrast in the South between its cosmopolitan, tolerant present and its antebellum past, when Charleston was the capital of the slave trade. It was in Charleston that a state convention adopted the “ordinance of secession” in December 1860, putting South Carolina on a path to become the first state to leave the Union, and the first shots of the Civil War were fired four months later at Fort Sumter.

The shooting reignited demands that the South Carolina Legislature end its practice of flying the Confederate battle flag on the grounds of the state Capitol in Columbia.

But if the church shooting prompted comparisons to the 1963 bombing of a black church in Birmingham by white supremacists that killed four girls, it also illustrated how much has changed. The earlier bombing took place as black people struggled to secure basic civil rights, at a time when many were barred from voting, much less holding office. Alabama’s governor at the time, George C. Wallace, was the public face of white resistance, and no one was charged with the crime until 12 years later.

The shooting Wednesday took the life of a black state legislator, an arrest was made in hours, and some of the most emotional expressions of mourning came from Ms. Haley, whose parents are from India and who is the state’s first female governor and the first not of European descent.

Local, state and federal law enforcement officials started a manhunt for the suspect, distributing pictures of him entering the church, and asking people to be on the lookout for him or his 2000 Hyundai sedan. By midmorning Thursday, he had been identified as Mr. Roof, described as 5-foot-9 and weighing 120 pounds.

The police said it was a tip from a commuter that led to the arrest.

Deborah Dills was traveling along Highway 74 on Thursday morning from her home in Gastonia, N.C., to her part-time job at a florist in Kings Mountain, N.C., when she spotted a dark Hyundai Elantra with South Carolina plates. The car — and its driver, Ms. Dills, 51, soon thought — matched the descriptions in the police alert she had heard on the morning news.

“I thought oh no, Debbie, you’re just paranoid, you’ve had this on your mind so strong. This is not happening here. What would he be doing here?” Ms. Dills said in an interview.

Unsure of what to do, she called Todd Frady, the owner of the florist shop.

“She got kind of nervous and pulled off,” Mr. Frady said. He insisted she follow the car, while he called the Kings Mountain police.

Ms. Dills rushed back onto the highway, lined with stores and fast-food restaurants in a chain of suburbs west of Charlotte, in pursuit of the Hyundai. Finally at a stoplight near a Walmart in Shelby, N.C., she pulled up behind the car and read its license plate number to Mr. Frady, who relayed it to the police.

“That’s it,” he told her. “That’s him.”

A short time later, at 10:43 a.m., the police in Shelby, 250 miles north of Charleston, pulled over the Hyundai and arrested Mr. Roof. He waived extradition and was flown to South Carolina on Thursday evening and, amid extraordinary security, walked into the jail in Charleston County at 7:25 p.m.

As Mr. Roof, who was wearing a striped jail jumpsuit, entered the jail through a secured entrance, a police dog barked, cameras clicked and one woman muttered, “The bastard’s here.”

Nearby, a 15-year-old boy from North Charleston held a handwritten sign: “Your evil doing did not break our community! You made us stronger!”

The boy, Hikaym Rivers, said that he doubted Mr. Roof saw his message — and he questioned whether the suspect would have cared if he noticed the sign — but he said it was important to make a public statement one night after the shooting in Charleston.

“We’re supporting our community, and we’re taking a stand that no one can just take this away from us,” he said. “It’s our peace of mind.”

Jail officials said that Mr. Roof would make a court appearance on Friday afternoon.

In Charleston, nicknamed the Holy City for its large number of churches, many houses of worship held prayer vigils, for the dead and for survivors, that drew people from different communities, races and denominations together.

At Morris Brown A.M.E. Church, just a few blocks from Emanuel, the mood of a packed house alternated between grief, hope and resilience. Calls of “enough is enough” echoed as the Rev. John Richard Bryant called for an end to gun violence.

“You look like a quilt, you look like patches,” Mr. Bryant said. “You all fit somewhere.”

Hundreds of people packed the pews of the white-columned Second Presbyterian Church on Thursday evening in a vigil to remember the victims of the shooting. Pastors read Scripture, the congregation sang and the Rev. Sidney Davis delivered a rousing sermon, his voice cracking at times. After reading a passage from the Bible, he said, “Last night, Satan came again. Satan came to say white and black cannot raise God.”

Later, he told the racially mixed congregation that the bullets were not simply penetrating the people who died in the church. “It was all of us dying last night,” he said.",nytimes.com,True

A 21-year-old white man is suspected of opening fire on a prayer meeting he had been attending at an African-American church in Charleston, S.C., on Wednesday night. Nine people were fatally shot before he fled in a black sedan. (Our live blog has the latest.) This is security footage of him entering the church.

After an intense overnight manhunt, the authorities said they had arrested the suspect, identified as Dylann Storm Roof, 200 miles away in North Carolina.

The case was being handled as a hate crime. A cousin of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was one of the victims, said in an interview with NBC that a survivor had heard the gunman saying: “I have to do it. You rape our women, and you are taking over our country. And you have to go.”

The Victims

Among the dead was Mr. Pinckney, the church’s pioneering pastor and a state senator. “He was my friend, he was my colleague, but he was also my brother in Christ,” a fellow state senator said.

Two other men and six women, including Mr. Pinckney’s sister, were also killed, plunging the community into shock and mourning.

Where It Happened

The church is one of the nation’s oldest black congregations, with a history dating to the slavery era. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke there in 1962, when it was a center of civil rights organizing.

The Suspect

The F.B.I. said Mr. Roof had never been on their radar. His uncle said he received a gun for his birthday in April, and his Facebook photo shows him in a jacket bearing the flags of two former white supremacist regimes, in apartheid-era South Africa and the former Rhodesia.

City officials did not release information about the victims and did not say how many people were in the church during the shooting. Hospital officials declined to comment.

Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said the city was offering a reward for information leading to the arrest of the gunman, whom the police described as a clean-shaven white man about 21 years old who was wearing a gray sweatshirt, bluejeans and Timberland boots. Chief Mullen described him as “extremely dangerous.”

In the first hours after the shooting, the police blocked reporters and passers-by from approaching the church, opposite a Marriott Courtyard hotel, because of a bomb threat. Many among the cluster of media workers were political reporters in town to cover campaign events of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jeb Bush.

Helicopters with searchlights circled overhead, and a group of pastors knelt and prayed across the street.

“The question is, ‘Why God?’,” a man wearing a shirt bearing the name of the Empowerment Missionary Baptist Church said during the prayer.

Mr. McLaughlin has not attempted to defend his so-called Sodomite Suppression Act in court. Another Sacramento County judge previously gave Ms. Harris until June 25 to prepare an official title and ballot summary for the initiative, which would amend the California penal code to make sex with a person of the same gender an offense punishable by “bullets to the head or by any other convenient method.” Issuing the title and summary would let Mr. McLaughlin start gathering the 366,000 signatures needed to put the law before voters in November 2016.

It took 16 years of legal battles before Mr. Norris ultimately succeeded in decriminalizing homosexuality in 1993, and only after the Irish government had been dragged before the European Court of Human Rights.

The next major step toward the successful referendum came in 2003 when a lesbian couple, Catherine Zappone and her partner, Ann Louise Gilligan, began a legal action to force the state to recognize the marriage vows they had taken three years earlier in Canada. Despite legal reversals, the case galvanized support for same-sex marriage, putting it on the agenda for the first time.

“Initially, we were a small determined group, but we grew to be a large determined group,” Mr. O’Gorman said.

Re “Free Speech vs. Hate Speech” (editorial, May 7), about freedom of expression issues raised by a Muhammad art contest in Texas:

In the wake of the latest effort to kill people for their speech, this newspaper’s response was to focus on the bad motives of the purported “hate” speakers, assailing them for “inflicting deliberate anguish.” Yet as another editorial observed, it is “hateful” speech that requires the most vigilant protection: “If the rights of those whom civil libertarians have most cause to despise are slighted, then everyone’s rights are placed in jeopardy.”

That quotation comes from a 1978 New York Times editorial, which defended neo-Nazis’ right to “flaunt their hated symbols in the faces of people who survived the gas ovens” by marching through Skokie, Ill., a community heavily populated by Holocaust survivors.

In a world in which violence is increasingly being deployed to censor disfavored speech, defending the principles of civil society that this newspaper advocated over three decades ago is all the more important.

To the Editor:

Pamela Geller is an Islamophobe whose public remarks about Muslims have rightly been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center as hate speech. But she has the last word in your article (“Organizer of Cartoon Contest Trumpets the Results,” news article, May 5), wrapping herself in the mantle of the First Amendment as if she had made a useful contribution to a public dialogue about Islam.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/opinion/free-speech-vs-hate-speech.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"There is no question that images ridiculing religion, however offensive they may be to believers, qualify as protected free speech in the United States and most Western democracies. There is also no question that however offensive the images, they do not justify murder, and that it is incumbent on leaders of all religious faiths to make this clear to their followers.

But it is equally clear that the Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest in Garland, Tex., was not really about free speech. It was an exercise in bigotry and hatred posing as a blow for freedom.

That distinction is critical because the conflicts that have erupted over depictions of the Prophet Muhammad, most notably the massacre of staff members at the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo in January by two Muslim brothers, have generated a furious and often confused debate about free speech versus hate speech. The current dispute at the American chapter of the PEN literary organization over its selection of Charlie Hebdo for a freedom of expression courage award is a case in point — hundreds of PEN’s members have opposed the selection for “valorizing selectively offensive material.”

Investigators believe Mr. Israel robbed five women and tried to rob a sixth in the Borough Park neighborhood from March 21 to April 6.

Mr. Israel targeted Asian women walking alone because he believed he could overpower them, Mr. Thompson said. The victims were ages 21 to 43.

He told other Hebrew and Arabic news outlets that he would rather be able to hang a large portrait of his son outside his house in the Shuafat district of East Jerusalem, in territory that Israel captured from Jordan in 1967 and that the Palestinians claim as part of a future state.

“The occupation authorities are trying to improve their image in the world,” Mr. Abu Khdeir told Maan, an independent Palestinian news agency. Including Muhammad’s name on the state memorial, he said, “would not change the racist reality of the Israeli occupation.”

When those suspected of killing Muhammad were indicted, Israel’s Ministry of Defense said that it recognized Muhammad as a “victim of terrorism” because of the “nationalistic motive” for the attack. The designation entitled Muhammad’s family to the same compensation and benefits that Israeli victims of Palestinian terrorism receive. It also placed him in the same category as the Israeli victims whose names are listed on the official memorial.

The Abu Khdeirs are not citizens of Israel. Like most Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, they have permanent resident status, which affords them social welfare benefits and the right to work in Israel, but not an Israeli passport or the right to vote in national elections.

The Israeli authorities said it was not the first time Israel had memorialized Palestinian victims of Jewish violence in that way.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/us/mississippi-man-charged-in-noose-display.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"A former University of Mississippi student has been indicted on federal charges in connection with a noose put on a statue of James Meredith, the student who integrated the campus, the Justice Department said Friday. The former student, Graeme Harris of Alpharetta, Ga., faces one count of conspiracy to violate civil rights and one count of using a threat of force to intimidate black students because of their race. The noose and a former Georgia flag that prominently featured the Confederate battle emblem were placed on the statue on the Ole Miss campus in Oxford in February 2014. Mr. Harris, who is white, is no longer enrolled. The campus was the scene of anti-integration protests that erupted into violence, and Mr. Meredith had to be escorted by armed federal agents as he enrolled under court order as the first black student at the university in 1962. Mr. Meredith, now 81, said Friday that it is a shame that Mississippi had to rely on federal authorities to prosecute the case. “What it is saying is that the only possible justice for a black in the state of Mississippi is the federal government and if there’s anything that we don’t need it’s that being our only means of expecting justice,” he said. The local district attorney said in 2014 that state charges would not be filed because no state laws had been broken.

The language on bias intimidation was the cornerstone of the prosecution of Dharun Ravi, the Rutgers student who was convicted in 2012 of using a webcam to spy on his roommate having sex with another man. His roommate, Tyler Clementi, jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge a few days after discovering posts about the webcam on Twitter, and his suicide became a rallying point against the bullying of gay teenagers.

Defense lawyers said on Tuesday that the Supreme Court’s decision could affect the appeals in that case, because the judge allowed evidence of Mr. Clementi’s state of mind.

The jury found that Mr. Ravi had knowingly harassed Mr. Clementi because he was gay. But it also convicted him based on Mr. Clementi’s “reasonable belief” that he was being harassed because he was gay.

Jurors said after the conviction that some of the most convincing evidence of Mr. Ravi’s guilt came from Mr. Clementi’s own complaints and online posts after he learned that he had been spied on.

The bias-intimidation statute itself was debated during and after the trial.

In his instructions to the jury, the judge criticized the Legislature for the “muddled” language of the statute. And he declined to add the penalties for bias intimidation when he sentenced Mr. Ravi. (Bias intimidation generally elevates a crime, and punishment, by one degree, typically adding months of incarceration.)

The judge sentenced Mr. Ravi to 30 days in a county jail, and he was released on good behavior after 20 days. The state appealed, arguing that the bias-intimidation conviction merited at least a prison sentence.

But Mr. Ravi’s lawyers argued the bias statute was flawed.

“To criminalize a defendant for a victim’s mistaken belief about the defendant’s motive would turn the bias-intimidation statute into a mockery of itself,” they wrote in their appeal.

“The Supreme Court agreed with me,” Mr. Ravi’s lead lawyer, Steven D. Altman, said Tuesday. “Now it’s a question of to what extent that affects the rest of the jury verdicts. You’re sitting there hearing testimony about a victim’s state of mind. It’s sympathetic. Isn’t it going to taint and affect how you view the rest of the proofs?”

Lawrence S. Lustberg, who argued the case for the state’s Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said the statute was arbitrary because it could mean that even if two defendants committed the same crime, one could be found guilty and the other not depending on what the victim thought.

“The whole idea is that when you commit an act, you’re supposed to know, ‘Am I committing a crime or not?’ ” he said on Tuesday. “If criminal liability depends on another person’s idiosyncratic point of view, the defendant can’t possibly be on notice.”

The case involved employees in the public works department in the town of Gloucester, in South Jersey, who were in a garage with a 16-by-8-foot steel storage cage in 2007. A white employee locked a black worker, Steven Brodie Jr., inside the cage. Mr. Brodie said he heard the defendant, David Pomianek Jr., say, “Oh, you see, you throw a banana in the cage and he goes right in,” to which the other white employees laughed. The men unlocked the door after a few minutes, and asked Mr. Brodie if he was O.K., saying they were “just joking around.”

Mr. Brodie said the episode left him feeling humiliated, and that the comment had been “racial.”

The jurors found that Mr. Pomianek had not known that his conduct would cause offense to Mr. Brodie. But they convicted him because they found that Mr. Brodie reasonably believed that he was purposely intimidated because of his race.

“With this plea and her waive of appeal,” he continued, “we are assured that she will serve substantial time behind bars.”

Ms. Menendez, who has a history of violent confrontations, was arrested after the attack and charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, which carries a possible sentence of 25 years to life. She chose Mr. Sen as her target because she believed he was Muslim or Hindu, prosecutors said.

According to the district attorney’s office, Ms. Menendez told the police that she “pushed a Muslim off the train tracks because I hate Hindus and Muslims ever since 2001 when they put down the twin towers I’ve been beating them up.” According to a roommate, Mr. Sen, who lived in Elmhurst, was born in India and was raised Hindu. He had opened up a small business on the Upper West Side the same year he was killed.

The groups walked south together and a shouting match erupted between them.

Mr. Viorst said Mr. Dixon “abruptly struck” Ms. Nettles in the face with a closed fist, knocking her to the ground and slamming her head on the pavement. He then leaned over her and pounded her head with his fist, ramming her head repeatedly into the pavement, the prosecutor said.

Ms. Nettles, 21, an assistant at a fashion company who aspired to become a clothing designer, was battered beyond recognition. She lingered in a coma for less than a week before being taken off life support.

Hours after the attack, the police arrested Paris Wilson, 20, of Harlem, who wore similar clothes and bore a resemblance to Mr. Dixon, Mr. Viorst said. Both men had been in the group.

Three days later, Mr. Dixon visited Mr. Wilson at his home and promised to take responsibility for the assault, Mr. Viorst said. Then Mr. Wilson’s mother escorted Mr. Dixon to a police station, where he made statements acknowledging it was he who had assaulted Ms. Nettles, Mr. Viorst said.

Those statements, though incriminating, did not immediately clear up the matter, prosecutors said. Witnesses had identified Mr. Wilson as the attacker and no surveillance cameras captured the crime, law enforcement officials said.

Charges were eventually dropped against Mr. Wilson in November 2013, and investigators continued to look for evidence, prosecutors said.

The case was presented last week to a grand jury, which voted to indict Mr. Dixon on first- and second-degree manslaughter charges, as well as first-degree assault. The jury did not charge Mr. Dixon with murder, which would have required proving he intended to kill Ms. Nettles.

A hate-crime indictment would have required the prosecution to prove Mr. Dixon’s motive for killing Ms. Nettles was that she was transgender. Investigators have not been able to determine what was said before the first blow was struck, law enforcement officials said.

Ms. Nettles’s killing incensed the transgender community in New York and prompted vigils, protests and the formation of an advocacy group, the Trans Women of Color Collective. For many, Ms. Nettles’s death became emblematic of violence against transgender people, who are often the targets of beatings, and what many of them see as the indifference the authorities show across the country to the killings of men transitioning to women.

Lourdes Hunter, the director of the Trans Women of Color Collective, said the long delay in bringing charges against Mr. Dixon reflected the low priority such cases have among the police and prosecutors. Ms. Hunter also questioned why the attack was not treated as a hate crime, because no motive other than Ms. Nettles’s sexual orientation had been suggested. She also wondered why Mr. Dixon was not charged with murder.

Mr. Mullet’s sentence was scaled back to 10 years and 9 months, from 15 years. The seven-year sentences given to four other men were reduced to five years, while three other followers saw sentences cut to three years, seven months from five years.

Six women and two men were sentenced to one or two years each and have already been released.

Steven M. Dettelbach, the United States attorney in Cleveland, said, “We’re gratified that there are significant terms of incarceration for what we feel was repeated and violent conduct.”

But Mr. Mullet’s defense lawyers said the new sentences, particularly that for Mr. Mullet, who is 69, were clearly excessive and vowed to appeal.

Mr. Mullet is the bishop and patriarch of a community of about 18 families in Bergholz, Ohio, that combined religious fervor with stringent discipline.

In 2011, groups of his followers carried out a series of bizarre nighttime attacks on Amish critics, who had called Mr. Mullet a cult leader and refused to honor his shunning decrees. His followers jumped victims in their homes, shearing off the men’s beards and the women’s waist-length hair, which are central to Amish identity.

The application of the 2009 federal hate crimes law to the case was unusual and was appealed by the defendants. In August, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that Judge Polster’s instruction to the jury had been too broad.

Judge Polster had told the jury that the religion of the victims must be one “significant factor” motivating the assaults. But the appeals panel ruled that, for the attacks to be a hate crime, the religion of the victim must be the main motivation.

“When all is said and done, considerable evidence supported the defendants’ theory that interpersonal and intrafamily disagreements, not the victims’ religious beliefs, sparked the attacks,” the appeals court ruled.

Whenever Mr. Mullet is freed he will return to a community “forever changed,” as his defense lawyers put it. In November his wife of 49 years, Martha Mullet, died from cardiac arrest. Mr. Mullet was not permitted to attend her funeral.

DURHAM, N.C. — Prosecutors will seek the death penalty for the man charged with the killings of three Arab-American students in a Chapel Hill, N.C., apartment complex, the district attorney’s office handling the case said Monday.

The suspect, Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, turned himself into a sheriff’s office shortly after 6 p.m. on Feb. 10. That was less than an hour after police found the bodies of Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21; her husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23; and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19.

Roger Echols, the Durham County district attorney, notified Judge Orlando F. Hudson on Wednesday of his intention to seek capital punishment, according to a document filed with the Superior Court.

A hearing to determine whether there is enough evidence to pursue a death-penalty case was scheduled for Monday. That hearing was postponed because of a scheduling conflict in the district attorney’s office, said the office’s administrative assistant, Candy Clark. A new date has not been set, but is expected in early April.",nytimes.com,True

Today, when jingoism and intolerance go hand in hand in some quarters, Myrdal’s conclusions seem self-evident, and “American Denial” is largely content to let academics point out the obvious. The film, directed by Llewellyn Smith (who also produced along with Christine Herbes-Sommers and Kelly Thomson), does eventually work its way to some intriguing notions. There is, for instance, the suggestion that the present-day success of some black Americans in politics and entertainment actually reinforces entrenched racism, the example of the few giving us unconscious permission to ignore the problems of the many.

But the film doesn’t linger long on these more complex questions, and in any case the only voices we hear are those of comfortable-looking academics. “Hate in America,” the Investigation Discovery program, produced in partnership with the Southern Poverty Law Center, gets closer to the real-world consequences of intolerance and discrimination. Here, the victims of bias crimes, or their survivors, do the talking.

Mr. Harris revisits three crimes: the race-related murder of James C. Anderson in Mississippi in 2011, the shootings at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 and a homophobic attack on two men in Manhattan in 2013.

Much of Investigation Discovery’s fare is lurid and lowbrow, but “Hate in America” is an exception. Mr. Harris details the crimes and conducts sensitive, often moving interviews with those who were affected. Why didn’t you just walk away, he asks Nicholas Porto, one of the men beaten near Madison Square Garden after he responded to gay slurs being shouted at him and his boyfriend.

“Because the more you walk away,” Mr. Porto says, “sooner or later you run out of places to walk to.”",nytimes.com,True

The police initially described the shooting as stemming from a parking dispute with a white middle-aged neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, who later turned himself in and was charged in the killings. Late on Thursday, the F.B.I. said it would look into whether the shooting was a hate crime.

Still, Mahmoud Shabeeb expressed his outrage on Twitter at what he perceived to be inconsistent standards when either the suspects or the victims of a crime were Muslim.

The satirical Jordanian website Kharabeesh posted angry expressions from across the Arab world, and included a translation of a Twitter message by the CNN political commentator Sally Kohn with a hashtag, in Arabic, “#Western_Media_Standards.”

A comment to the post by Kharabeesh alleged “hypocrisy, media that sees with one eye only.”

A cartoonist for Al Ghad, Naser Al-Jafari, posted on Facebook a cartoon of Mr. Hicks, the suspect, standing beside a militant of the Islamic State who is dressed in black with his face covered. It is titled, in English, “The Visible & Invisible Face of Terror.”

Another popular Jordanian cartoonist, Osama Hajjaj, posted on Twitter a menacing depiction of Mr. Hicks in the colors of the American flag — red hair and ears, white eyes and a blue nose. His black beard and mouth resemble an Islamic State militant dressed in black. Many social media posts attempted to liken Mr. Hicks, 46, a former auto parts dealer who had been studying to become a paralegal, with Islamic extremists accused of killing Americans.

Dr. Mohammad Yousif Abu-Salha, the father of the two slain women, also questioned the attention his daughter's killing had received in comparison with crimes committed by Muslims.

“If a Muslim commits a crime, it’s on the news 24/7 for two months,” Dr. Abu-Salha, a psychiatrist in Clayton, N.C., told The Associated Press. “When we are executed in numbers, it’s on the news for seconds.”

On Friday, Jordan’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling on all Jordanians in the United States to be cautious and on alert after the shooting.

Queen Rania of Jordan, using the popular hashtag #muslimlivesmatter, sent her condolences to the victims’ families to her 3.6 million followers on Twitter.

And she said he would complain about noise — he was upset when she and her friends were playing a card game and he thought they were too noisy, and he was again upset when she pulled into the lot with music playing loudly in her car.

“He was definitely aggressive, and he spoke harshly when he was upset,” she said.

The police say they never received any formal complaints, but Mr. Hicks, a 46-year-old former auto parts dealer who has been studying to become a paralegal, appears to have functioned as a self-appointed watchman in the complex. The Chapel Hill police released a report about a 2013 incident in which he apparently called them to complain that someone had allegedly grabbed a tow-truck driver’s arm while he was trying to tow a car. And just last month, he wrote on Facebook that he had called the police because he saw a couple having sex in a car in the parking lot.

Public records reveal only the barest of details about Mr. Hicks, who turned himself in after the shooting. He appears to have moved around the country several times. He voted in two recent North Carolina elections, once as a Democrat and once on a nonpartisan ballot. He has been divorced twice. His current wife, Karen Hicks, is now planning to seek a divorce, according to her lawyer, Rob Maitland.

“She doesn’t feel safe,” Mr. Maitland said. “She is outraged and heartbroken over all of this.”

Mr. Hicks’s Facebook page suggests that he has a strong interest in atheism and is contemptuous of religion; the page is filled with posts and cartoons mocking the intelligence of people who believe in the Bible. His anger appeared to be aimed primarily at Christians — in fact, in 2010 he decried as hypocritical opposition by Christians to a much-debated proposal for a mosque to be built near ground zero in Manhattan.

He also indicated that he was proud of owning a weapon: Last month, he posted an image of a gun on a scale with the words, “Yes, that is 1 pound 5.1 ounces for my loaded 38 revolver, its holster, and five extra rounds in a speedloader.”

Yusor Abu-Salha and Mr. Barakat had also been accosted by Mr. Hicks before.

A friend of Yusor Abu-Salha’s said one of the altercations occurred last fall, after she left the apartment following a dinner and a game of Risk.

“Right after we left, Yusor heard a knock at the door, and it was Hicks,"" the friend, Amira Ata, told the media company Fusion. Mr. Hicks complained about extra cars in the neighborhood and of noise from the Risk game, she said. “While he was at the door talking to Yusor, he was holding a rifle, she told me later. He didn’t point it at anyone, but he still had it.”

The condominium complex is near the University of North Carolina, and the high number of students living in the complex contributed to parking and noise concerns. Students tend to live several to an apartment and are often out, or up, late.

Within the complex, even some residents who had not interacted with Mr. Hicks said they had heard about the confrontations over his efforts to control parking or noise levels.

“I didn’t really know him — I just saw him out when I walked my dog — but I knew he had some problems with other neighbors,” said Patricia Jordan, a resident of the complex.

Mr. Hicks’s behavior as a neighbor has become central to a debate about whether the killings were a hate crime — a possibility still being investigated by the local police. Ms. Hicks insisted that her husband’s political views showed that he was not bigoted: She has emphasized that he supports same-sex marriage, abortion rights and racial equality.

“He often champions, on his Facebook page, for the rights of many individuals,” said Ms. Hicks, who said she had been married to Mr. Hicks for seven years. “That’s just one of the things I know about him, is everyone is equal.”

Cynthia Hurley, who said she was married to Mr. Hicks years ago, said she had been unsettled by his enthusiasm for a 1993 film, “Falling Down,” which depicts a man violently lashing out at society. “That always freaked me out,” Ms. Hurley told The A.P. “He watched it incessantly. He thought it was hilarious. He had no compassion at all.”

Mr. Hicks is enrolled at Durham Technical Community College, working toward earning “multiple certifications in our paralegal technologies program,” according to a spokeswoman for the school, Carver Weaver.

There has been a pugnacious defensiveness among conservative Christians to any parallels between Christian overreach and Islamic overreach, as seen in the outraged reaction to President Obama’s acknowledgment at the National Prayer Breakfast this month that the West has plenty to regret as well.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/12/us/muslim-student-shootings-north-carolina.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Even as Chapel Hill awoke on Wednesday, frustration had already spread on Twitter throughout Europe and Asia, as Muslims as far away as Indonesia shared photographs and details of the victims’ lives.

The Chapel Hill police quickly tried to tamp down the fears, releasing a morning statement that identified parking as the cause of the dispute, without confirming whether the victims had been shot in the head. The police chief, Chris Blue, added, “We understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated, and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case.”

In the afternoon, Ripley Rand, the United States attorney for the region, said the shooting appeared to have been “an isolated incident” and “not part of a targeted campaign against Muslims.”

Friends and neighbors struggled to make sense of what had happened. Those who knew the victims — identified as Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21; her husband, Mr. Barakat, 23; and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19 — said they were all model students from well-educated, successful local families.

They had nonetheless run into previous problems over parking with the man who was arrested, Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, a former car parts salesman who was studying to be a paralegal at Durham Technical Community College.

He was one of their neighbors. They lived on opposite sides of the two-story Finley Forest complex on Summerwalk Circle, where the shooting occurred — a condominium complex tucked into the woods about a mile and a half east of the main University of North Carolina campus. Residents said Mr. Hicks’s apartment was adjacent to the main parking lot; the students lived on the other side, where little parking could be found.

Mohammad Yousif Abu-Salha, the father of the two women who were killed, said Yusor had told him that she and her husband had been harassed for their appearance by a neighbor who was wearing a gun on his belt. On his Facebook page, Mr. Hicks recently posted a photograph of what he said was his .38-caliber, five-shot revolver.

A friend of Yusor said she knew that Mr. Hicks had complained to the couple before about making noise and the use of parking spaces by their visitors, and that he once came to their door carrying a rifle.

It is not clear whether they ever called the police about the altercations.

Their Facebook pages and other material online show a cheerful threesome who were devoted to family and charitable work. Mr. Barakat was a second-year student at the university’s graduate school of dentistry, and his wife was set to enroll in the same school later this year. Her sister was an undergraduate at North Carolina State University who had recently won an award for her artistic talents.

“They were gems of their communities and left a lasting impression on the people around them,” Suzanne Barakat, a sister of Deah Barakat, said Wednesday, reading a brief statement while flanked by several tearful family members. “We are still in a state of shock and will never be able to make sense of this horrendous tragedy.”

Mr. Hicks appeared to have a deep dislike of all religion. On his Facebook page, nearly all of his posts expressed support for atheism, criticism of Christian conservatives or both.

Last month, he posted a photograph that said, “Praying is pointless, useless, narcissistic, arrogant, and lazy; just like the imaginary god you pray to.”

Mr. Hicks’s wife, Karen, insisted at a news conference that her husband was not a bigot. “I can say with absolute belief that this incident had nothing to do with religion or the victims’ faith, but it was related to a longstanding parking dispute that my husband had with the neighbors,” she said.

His wife also pointed out his support for gay rights and the right to abortion.

But her comments and the Police Department’s caution about what was behind the fatal confrontation did not convince relatives of the dead who were familiar with details of the episode. One 911 caller, at 5:11 p.m. Tuesday, said she had heard five to 10 shots and “kids screaming.” Another, calling a minute later, said she had heard about eight shots and multiple people screaming, then a pause, and then three more shots.

The victims were shot inside an apartment, according to one of the calls, and family members said the police told them they had been shot in the head.

Mr. Barakat questioned the premise that a parking dispute alone could lead to such killings. “We all know it’s about more than that, unfortunately,” he said.

Many Muslims in the area of North Carolina known as the Research Triangle, where universities and technology companies are major employers, said they had been on edge in recent weeks. Although the area is dotted with mosques and interfaith events are a staple at universities and houses of worship, tensions have been rising since the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris, according to several Muslim leaders. Last month, Duke University abruptly canceled plans to broadcast the Muslim call to prayer on Fridays, citing security concerns, after Franklin Graham, the son of the evangelist Billy Graham, raised vehement objections on Facebook.

Broadcasting the call to prayer from a church bell tower, intended as a symbol of religious inclusion, instead became a source of religious division.

“There is a tendency to say, ‘This is a nice place, these eruptions of violence don’t belong here,’ ” said Omid Safi, the director of the Duke Islamic Studies Center and a professor of Islamic studies. “And yet here we are. This is, in all of the heartbreak and violence and sadness, where we are.”

Linda Sarsour, a longtime Arab-American activist in Brooklyn, who said she was working with the family, added that for those who fear mistreatment, the episode “sends a message to other young people in the Muslim community that the fear is valid.”

Much of their rage online addressed a perceived double standard in the news media, with posts saying that the killing of three Muslims was not receiving much attention.

In fact, the police did not release the names of the victims or the accused until after 2 a.m. Wednesday; Mr. Hicks turned himself in to sheriff’s deputies in Pittsboro, a few miles away, but it was not clear when. During a court appearance Wednesday, a judge ordered him held without bond. By that point, most major American news organizations had reported the story, but that did not slow the allegations of news media neglect.

The #muslimlivesmatter hashtag echoed the #blacklivesmatter hashtag that gained popularity after the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police officers. Both tap into a sense of grievance in minority communities that feel marginalized and disrespected.

To share the achievements of the slain students, friends and family members created a Facebook page, Our Three Winners, early Wednesday. Several of the posts showed images of Mr. Barakat and Yusor Abu-Salha at their wedding.

Friends also praised Mr. Barakat’s work with a charity that provided dental supplies to the poor, and noted that he planned to travel to Turkey to provide dental care to refugees from the civil war in Syria, narrating a video to raise money.

On the U.N.C. campus on Wednesday evening, thousands packed the central plaza known as the Pit in a silent, dramatic show of solidarity. Dozens of friends and relatives offered remembrances. One, who did not give her name, concluded her speech: “Muslim lives matter. All lives matter.”",nytimes.com,True

All three men are from Brandon. They were charged in the death of James Craig Anderson. Prosecutors said the men had harassed or assaulted black people who they thought were homeless or intoxicated.

A tender reconstruction of personal loss, “Matt Shepard Is a Friend of Mine” retraces the life of the University of Wyoming student whose 1998 murder put a national spotlight on hate crimes against gay people. Variably effective, this debut feature documentary from Michele Josue seeks to restore the Matt Shepard of his friends’ and family’s memories, and in so doing return a human symbol to a state of ordinary but beloved individuality.

Ms. Josue narrates the film as a personal journey and a kind of grief circle with those who knew and loved the gregarious Mr. Shepard. That means a lot of tearful reminiscences, often of fairly routine bonding among friends, though his sense of belonging is, unusually, rooted abroad in the Swiss boarding school he attended while his father worked an oil job in Saudi Arabia. But practically any details would seem poignant in anticipation of what we know would come.

Ms. Josue pushes back those expectations somewhat in a couple of ways. A heartening undertow comes from Mr. Shepard’s parents: a mother ultimately turned activist and a father whose teary adoration is still inspiring. But there’s also an awful episode on Mr. Shepard’s high school trip to Morocco, where he was raped. Before his nationally reported death, he’d suffered hateful violence.

In lingering over moody night streets and trembling faces, Ms. Josue has brought this film to the verge of becoming a tear-jerker. But, as epitomized in an extraordinary scene with a conflicted priest, it’s all part of a shared soul-searching that still continues.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/magazine/the-fire-on-the-57-bus-in-oakland.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Crime was easy enough to understand — in 2013, Oakland had the nation’s highest robbery rate. But this was something different. An act of savage brutality had taken place in a public setting in the middle of the afternoon.

Oakland is one of America’s most diverse cities. We pride ourselves on our tolerance; this is, after all, the Bay Area. Yet for all its laid-back inclusiveness, Oakland is also a city of grim contrasts. The wealthier hills neighborhoods have good schools, low crime and views of the bay. The historic buildings downtown are filling with tech start-ups, boutiques peddling handmade jeans and nightspots with seven-ingredient cocktails. But little of this good fortune has spilled over into East Oakland, where Richard lived, a region of grinding poverty and chronic violence. Richard and Sasha lived in the same city, but their paths might never have crossed if they didn’t both ride the 57 bus.

Sasha Fleischman’s ride to and from school took an hour and involved two transfers, but Sasha used the time to nap or do homework. Maybeck High School, Sasha’s school in Berkeley, caters to bright, quirky kids interested in taking, its website says, “personal and intellectual risks.” That description certainly applied to Sasha, a skinny, intensely analytical kid with wavy, chin-length brown hair, thick eyebrows and a radiant smile, who started inventing languages at the age of 7 or 8.

After reading a web comic called “Poly in Pictures,” which explores polyamory, gender, sexuality and orientation, Sasha, then a 16-year-old boy named Luke, began an epistemological investigation of gender identity, asking friends and family how they knew what their gender was.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“At first I just assumed that I was this heterosexual man, because I didn’t have any reason to assume otherwise,” Sasha said one afternoon last year, sitting on the Fleischmans’ red sofa by a window festooned with a chain of paper cranes. “But I started thinking, Well, am I a guy?” Most people told Sasha that they just knew what gender they were, but Sasha didn’t feel that way.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“And so I started identifying as genderqueer,” Sasha said. “For me, at least, genderqueer includes an aspect of questioning. And that was a big part of it for me. The fact that I was questioning my gender meant that I was genderqueer.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Sasha’s parents, Karl Fleischman and Debbie Crandall, work in education, and their relationship with their only child has an affable ease. Karl, a college-radio D.J. turned public-school kindergarten teacher, is the shyer of the two, with a dry wit and a quick grin. Debbie, a bookkeeper at a private school, is more emotional and effusive. But while they embraced Sasha’s new name (chosen for its gender neutrality) and mostly remembered to use the preferred plural pronoun, “they,” to refer to their child, they still found Sasha’s rejection of gender a bit perplexing. (Telling Sasha’s story also poses a linguistic challenge, because English doesn’t offer a ready-made way to talk about people who identify as neither male nor female. Sasha prefers “they,” “it” or the invented gender-neutral pronoun “xe.” The New York Times does not use these terms to refer to individuals.)

“I’m trying to get my head around it,” Debbie admitted, two years into the change. “I understand coming out as gay or even trans. But this is harder for me to understand. I support them,” she said, referring to her child, “but I just don’t understand what it means.”

Because genderqueer or agender people don’t have a box to check on most questionnaires, there isn’t much data about how many people identify this way, or even what most of them mean by the term. The 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 13 percent of transgender or gender-nonconforming respondents identified as “a gender not listed here.” These respondents were more likely to be young and educated and to live in the coastal blue states than other transgender people. They were also more likely to have been harassed or assaulted.

Since preschool, Sasha had attended small, alternative schools, where challenging gender norms was unremarkable. In a Montessori middle-school grade with only 25 students, two identified as transgender, including Sasha’s best friend. Maybeck High School, with just more than 100 students, had two who were transgender and two, including Sasha, who identified as agender. Outside school, Sasha dove into virtual and real-world communities devoted to constructing alternate realities, filled with people who created new languages (known as conlangers) or who obsessed over the intricately plotted web comic “Homestuck” or who participated in Live Action Role Playing, a theatrical descendant of Dungeons and Dragons, in which costumed players acted out game scenarios in places like Tilden Park on the outskirts of Berkeley. In this world, quirkiness was not just accepted but encouraged.

Sasha started wearing a skirt in January 2013, accepting three hand-me-downs from a friend. Previously Sasha’s style tended toward steampunk — top hats, tweeds, vests and bow ties, even a pocket watch. But Sasha loved the sartorial gender-mashup that came from adding a skirt to the vest and bow tie. For Sasha’s parents, the most surprising thing about the new look was how public it was. Shy and introverted, their child had always excelled at being invisible. Now the teenager was not just visible but conspicuous — a boy in a skirt. Instead of bashfulness, Sasha exhibited a newfound confidence.

“It feels like making this discovery and coming to terms with it has really helped Sasha become themselves,” Karl mused, fiddling with the rainbow-colored friendship bracelet he wore. “Sasha seems more comfortable in the world.”

Still, Debbie and Karl worried that publicly flouting gender norms could be dangerous — even in the liberal Bay Area. Karl was once beaten up while jogging in Berkeley by some men in a pickup truck who thought he was gay. Debbie was concerned that Sasha’s skirt-wearing might attract a similar response. “I worry about how the world sees it and what the world can do — what crazy people can do,” she said.

For a long time these fears seemed to be groundless. Sasha wore a skirt every day from January to November 2013 and experienced only one negative reaction, when an older woman at a bus stop insisted, “You’re not a girl!”

And so when Sasha drifted into sleep on the 57 bus on Nov. 4, it was an untroubled sleep. As the teenager would say later: “I can sleep through anything on the bus.”

When Richard Thomas boarded the bus that day, he was a junior at Oakland High School, his third school in as many years. Located in the city’s middle-class foothills, O High, as it’s known locally, is the oldest of Oakland’s high schools (Gertrude Stein attended it). While it draws Asian, Latino and African-American students from throughout the city, the school is spurned by the white families who live nearby. Its test scores aren’t terrible, but it has a reputation as a rough place.

Like Sasha, Richard had a long commute home from school, although his began close to where Sasha’s ended. From Oakland High, he traveled to the part of town known as Deep East, where he lived with his mother, Jasmine Jackson, his mother’s fiancé, his 4-year-old brother and one of the two cousins his mother had raised ever since their mother, Jasmine’s sister Savannah, was murdered in 2006. The house, a single-story white-stucco bungalow, was clean and snug and sparsely furnished, decorated with framed photos of family.

A food-service worker at a residential care facility, Jasmine sent Richard to Oakland High because she thought it offered a better academic and social environment than the high school in her own neighborhood. Like Debbie Crandall, she worried about what the world could do to her child. She had Richard when she was only 15, splitting up with his father, Richard Sr., shortly afterward. While she was proud of always having a job, she didn’t earn much money. She wanted her son to attend college and to have a career.

These were big dreams in her part of town. An investigation by The San Francisco Chronicle found that of some 600 black male students who start at Oakland high schools as freshmen each year, only about 300 end up graduating and fewer than 100 graduate with the requirements needed to attend a California state college or university. The odds of landing in the back of a police cruiser, on the other hand, are much better. African-American boys make up less than 30 percent of Oakland’s under-age population but account for nearly 75 percent of all juvenile arrests. And each year, dozens of black men and boys are murdered within the city limits.

From a young age, Richard lost family and friends to violence. In addition to his aunt Savannah, killed in a spray of bullets while sitting in a car in San Francisco, his aunt Tish was murdered by her boyfriend in 2008. Three of his childhood friends were murdered as well, most recently his best friend, Tyronta Mickens. People used to say Richard and Tyronta were twins, because they were both handsome, light-skinned boys with a goofy sense of humor and a penchant for practical jokes. When Richard was 14, the two were sent to a group home in Redding, after they were involved in a fight with some skateboarders. (Because Richard was a juvenile, the details of the case are sealed.) Tyronta was released before Richard, but shortly after that, on Jan. 7, 2013, he was shot multiple times while sitting in a car in an East Oakland parking lot.

When Richard found out about his friend’s death, he called his mother from the group home to ask if it was true. “He just started crying and crying,” Jasmine recalled. Instead of hanging up, Richard just put the phone down and walked away.

Richard came back to Oakland that summer, heading into his junior year. He signed up for a summer-job training program conducted by the Unity Council, an Oakland nonprofit, which led to an internship. His supervisors noted how much effort he put in, sometimes redoing the sloppy work of others. But when school started, Richard struggled. He fell behind academically and began cutting school. Early in September, Oakland High’s attendance compliance officer, Kaprice Wilson, found Richard outside school in the middle of the day, about to get on a bus with a girl who had just been suspended. When Wilson told him that she had to escort him back to class, Richard came along cheerfully, peppering her with questions. Wilson explained that she ran an intervention program for students who were chronically absent from school.

“Can I be in your program?” Richard asked.

Wilson was taken aback. Students didn’t usually volunteer for her program; they were assigned to it. She wasn’t exactly trying to fill slots either — she already had a caseload of some 800 chronically truant students, and her program was meant for freshmen and sophomores, who are easier to get back on track than juniors and seniors. But when she looked up Richard’s file, she saw that his grades were poor and his attendance spotty.

“I want you to help me like you help them,” Wilson remembered him saying. “Because I’ve been to a lot of schools, and I’ve been in trouble, but I’m really not a bad kid.”

‘I started thinking, Well, am I a guy?’

A petite woman who favored dangly earrings and liked to kick off her shoes while working, Wilson was a kind of surrogate mother to many of Oakland High School’s troubled kids. Some of them even called her Mom, bringing her their grades, photographs and artwork to hang on her walls and writing her apologies when they ran into trouble. Her tiny office was papered with these missives: “Maria is your best daughter ever,” read one. “I’m sorry mom, she made me hecka mad,” read another — written, Wilson told me, by a kid who had just been suspended.

Richard adopted Wilson’s office as a kind of safe zone, a place to hang out between classes. He would confide in her about his life. When other kids were there, he would often draw them out, listening to their problems. He liked to give and receive hugs and was known for his silly, childlike sense of humor, his willingness to look foolish if it would get a laugh. He gave Wilson his mother’s phone number, suggesting that they might talk. He wanted his mother to know that he was doing everything he could to get on the right path. “I’m going to graduate,” he told Wilson. “And I’m going to make her happy.”

Yet Richard was apprehensive. He was having trouble understanding his schoolwork and wanted to be tested for learning disabilities. He was worried about graduating. And the violence around him was pressing in. That fall, another friend, this one from Oakland High, was shot. At the end of October, while walking to the store in an unfamiliar neighborhood with his cousin Gerald, Richard was robbed at gunpoint by two teenage boys who took his money, his phone, his coat and his shoes. In the moment, he told Wilson, he had only one thing on his mind: surviving. But later, he kept thinking about one of the robbers, whom Richard knew and had thought of as a friend. He felt betrayed.

Richard skipped school for a few days after that. On the afternoon of Nov. 4, Richard’s 18-year-old cousin, Lloyd Rhodes, showed up at Oakland High School and tried to persuade him to leave early. The campus security officer, Carlitta Collins, wouldn’t allow Lloyd on campus, because he wasn’t a student, so he hung around outside the gates until Richard got out of school. Before leaving for the bus stop, Richard gave Collins a hug.

“I’m telling you,” she said, “I didn’t feel nothing but love when he hugged me.”

Every Alameda County transit bus is equipped with cameras that continuously record sound and video from multiple vantage points. I first watched the video of the attack in the office of William Du Bois, Richard’s lawyer, on a laptop in a conference room. Before me was a grid of 12 views that could be watched simultaneously or one at a time. The video itself, grainy and impersonal, conveys the ordinariness of the afternoon. Passengers look at their phones or peer through the scratched windows at the darkening streets outside.

On the video, Richard and Lloyd board the bus at the front. Richard, wearing an orange-brimmed New York Knicks hat, is quiet and smiling. The heavyset Lloyd is loud and rambunctious — bouncing, shouting, trying to get the attention of a girl at the front. After using his bus pass, Lloyd catches sight of a tall boy in a white hoodie sitting near the back and heads his way. According to the statement Richard made to the police, it was this boy, whom Richard identified only as Jamal, who pointed out Sasha sleeping across the aisle from them, whispering, “Look at this dude.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

On the video, you can’t hear what Jamal says as he passes the lighter to Richard. Richard later told his lawyer and his mother that the whole thing was meant to be a prank. He thought the fabric would smolder for a moment, and Sasha would wake up and slap out the spark, startled but uninjured.

The skirt didn’t catch fire the first time Richard flicked the lighter, or the second or the third. The video shows the boys laughing and joking between tries, horsing around, cuffing each other. Then Richard flicks the lighter a fourth time. This time, the skirt ignites. Lloyd calls to the driver to open the back door. Richard jumps off the bus. Lloyd looks back and then stops, transfixed, as Sasha’s skirt erupts into a sheet of flame.

The next few seconds are hard to watch. Sasha’s voice is high and terrified. “I’m on fire! I’m on fire!” The flaming skirt looks unearthly, impossible. At first, Jamal howls with laughter, then, as Sasha careers toward him, he cringes and climbs onto his seat. “Everyone was running, laughing, screaming, yelling at the bus driver: ‘Stop the bus! Open the doors!' ” recalls Dan Gale, one of the two men who tackled Sasha and put out the fire. “I was yelling: ‘Get down! Get on the ground!’ I just dove.”

The bus stopped. Dazed and in shock, Sasha stood and pushed through the back doors onto the street.

On the video, Gale says, “You need to call an ambulance, man,” as Sasha paces outside, charred legs naked to the November chill, talking to Karl on a cellphone. Then the driver walks to the back of the bus and kicks the tattered remnant of Sasha’s skirt through the door.

“Real stupid!” he bellows, cursing at the boys.

Richard was alone in Kaprice Wilson’s office the next day when the police came to arrest him. He had been trying to speak with her all morning, even calling her from class, but Wilson asked him to wait until he had a break. She was on her way to meet him when she saw him being led away in handcuffs.

At the police station, Officers Anwawn Jones and Jason Anderson placed Richard in an interview room and left him there. A video shows Richard sitting by himself. An officer returns at one point to hand him a bag lunch. Richard unpacks a soda, a sandwich and a bag of chips. He smooths the paper bag flat and places the sandwich on top. Then he folds his hands and bows his head. He crosses himself three times. Then he begins to eat his lunch. When the police officers return, he has his head down on the table.""You didn’t eat all your chips?” Officer Jones asks. Richard says, “I was getting a little stomachache.”

The officers are friendly. They ask questions about Richard’s life — where he lives, what sports he plays, how he’s doing in school, whether he has a girlfriend. In response, Richard is candid, almost confiding. He tells them about the fight that sent him to the group home, about having “a little breakdown” after Tyronta’s murder, about his troubles in school. When they ask about the events of the previous afternoon, Richard tells them that he was on the 57 bus when he saw a man with his skirt on fire.

“What do you think about dudes who dress up in skirts?” Officer Jones asks.

“I’m not with that,” Richard says. “I wouldn’t say that I hate gay people, but I’m very homophobic.”

Jones nods. “O.K. Why would you call yourself homophobic?”

“I don’t have no problem with somebody if they like men. But like if you do too much? Nobody cares, really.”

“Do too much?”

“Taking it to the next level,” Richard explains. Jones asks for an example.

“Cross-dressing and like — some people, like they try to make everybody know that they are that.”

After asking Richard to go through the events on the bus a couple of times, the police reveal that they have video of the incident. They know he did it. They just want him to tell them why.

“Being stupid,” Richard says, his voice low.

“What would even remotely make you think about setting something on fire like that — someone’s clothing?” Anderson asks. “Was it because the dude was wearing a dress? Did you have a problem with him?”

“I don’t know.”

“People do things for a reason,” the officer says. “We’ve all made decisions in life that may not have been the best choice to make at a given time. What we’re trying to figure out is why this happened.”

“I’m homophobic,” Richard says at last. “I don’t like gay people.”

“Did you get angry because he’s a gay dude in a skirt, not just being gay but ‘doing too much?' ” Jones asks.

“Actually, I didn’t know that his skirt was going to do that, that it was going to catch like that,” Richard says. “It was like a little flame. I thought it was just going to go out.”

But it was too late to backpedal. Two days after Richard’s arrest, the Alameda County district attorney announced the charges: aggravated mayhem and assault with intent to cause great bodily injury, both felonies, each with a hate-crime clause that would add an additional one to three years in state prison to his sentence. If convicted, Thomas faced a maximum sentence of life in prison — a punishment he would never have faced had he been charged as a juvenile. Jamal, the boy who handed Richard the lighter, was never interviewed, arrested or charged.

On Nov. 8, four days after lighting Sasha’s skirt on fire, Richard wrote the teenager a letter.

“Dear Victum,” it began. “I apoligize for my actions, for the pain that I brought to you and your family. I was wrong for what I did. I was wrong. I had no reason to do that to you I don’t know what was going through my head at that time. Im not a monster, I have a big heart I never even thought of hurting anyone like the way I hurt you. I just wanted you to know that im deeply sorry for my actions. I think about what happened every second, I pray that you heal correctly and that you recover and live a happy life. Please forgive me thats all I want. I take responsibility for all my actions, I’ll take all the consiquences,” he wrote. “I’m not just saying this because im incarcerated I honestly mean every word.” He signed it, “Love, Richard Thomas.”

A few days later, he wrote a second letter, this one addressed to “Mr. Fleischman.” It was nearly three pages long, written in neat cursive.

“I had a nightmare last night and I woke up sweating and apoligizing,” he wrote. “I really hope you get back to the way you were. I went to court yesterday and there still making me seem like a monster, but im not. I’m a good kid if you get to know me. I’m sure you would have been a nice person to,” he continued. “I was hoping that I can meet you face to face so I can apoligize to you.”

He went on to detail the charges against him, explaining that he was willing to accept the assault charges but that he rejected the hate-crime enhancements. “I don’t have a problem with homosexual’s,” he explained. “I have friends thats homosexuals and we never had problems so I don’t look at you wrong because of your sexualitie. Honestly I could care less if you like men you weren’t trying to talk to me in that way.”

As for himself, he said: “I am not a thug, gangster, hoodlum, nor monster. Im a young African American male who’s made a terrible mistake.” Perhaps, he suggested, he and Fleischman had things in common. “I’ve also been hurt alot for no reason, not like I hurt you but Ive been hurt physically and metally so I know how it feels, the pain and confusion of why me I’ve felt it before plenty of times.”

William Du Bois put the letters in his briefcase. Because they contained admissions of guilt, he felt he couldn’t send them to Sasha until after the case was resolved. It would be 14 months before Sasha read them.

‘I am not a thug, gangster, hoodlum, nor monster. Im a young African American male who's made a terrible mistake.’

When Sasha arrived home from the hospital on Nov. 27, 23 days after the attack, it was to a street crowded with reporters and photographers. There had been a march along the route of the 57 bus, with supporters tying rainbow-colored ribbons to street signs and telephone poles along the way. Cards, letters and packages poured in, including some from Canada. An online medical fund raised $31,000 in donations. Several high schools had sponsored skirt-wearing days; so did a local bookstore. At Oakland High, Richard’s school, the varsity basketball team wore blue jerseys with Sasha’s name on them and the words “No H8.”

Sasha gave an interview to a local news station, wearing a skirt over bandaged legs. “I was really excited that an agender person was in the news,” Sasha explained to me later. “But I wasn’t that excited about the circumstances, obviously. Those were my feelings: This is really great — but does it have to be me?”

Sasha acknowledged feeling angry sometimes. While the long-term prognosis was excellent, everything was more difficult at the moment — walking, taking a shower, getting dressed. The pain made it hard to sleep.

Ten days after Sasha got home from the hospital, the family invited Dan Gale, one of the two men who put out the fire, to their house for brunch (the other man was never identified). Toward the end of the meal, the conversation turned to Richard Thomas. Debbie and Karl had told reporters that they wanted to see Richard tried as a juvenile, not as an adult, and they had consistently cautioned against leaping to conclusions about Richard’s motivation. Gale, a gravel-voiced construction worker with a walrus mustache, remarked that he thought Sasha’s parents showed more forbearance than he would have. He turned to Sasha.

“How do you feel on that? I mean, this kid hurt you.”

Sasha considered this. “I know he hurt me,” Sasha said. “He did something that’s really dangerous and stupid. But then again, he’s a 16-year-old kid, and 16-year-old kids are kind of dumb. It’s really hard to know what I want for him.”

Jasmine Jackson, Richard’s deeply religious mother, tried to believe that everything that happened was part of a larger plan. “God is good,” she repeated in the courthouse elevator. “God is good. God is so good.” When Richard was escorted into the courtroom for the many procedural hearings that followed his arrest, Jasmine would catch his eye and make a heart shape with her fingers, pressing it to her chest.

She was sure that Richard had learned something from what he did. “We’re all going to learn something from this,” she said frequently. But once, after saying it, she shook her head. “I wish it hadn’t gone this far and he could have learned a different way,” she said. “I wish that the courts would give him a suitable punishment so that he can learn from this, instead of just being institutionalized.” This was her biggest fear. “I want him to have enough time to do something with his life,” she said.

Everyone I interviewed who knew Richard made a point of telling me that he was not homophobic. Richard had a gay friend, they pointed out, and his mother’s cousin is transgender. Du Bois wouldn’t allow me to interview his client; given the potential sentence, he felt the risks were too great. But he argued that it made no sense to describe a child’s still-forming opinions as “hate.”

“Lynchings — they’re hate crimes,” he said. But as for a boy wearing a skirt, he went on, “the kid who thinks that this is anomalous and decides to play a prank is not committing a hate crime.”

O’Malley, the district attorney, didn’t see it that way. “If somebody commits a heinous crime against somebody because they’re a member of a protected class, that is very purposeful discrimination,” she explained as we sat in her office, before a massive wooden desk that belonged to Earl Warren when he was the Alameda County D.A. Hate crimes, she argued, were discrimination, just as segregation was. “It’s important to show that this is the kind of behavior that will never be tolerated.”

Until the mid-1980s, the law made no distinction between crimes motivated by bigotry and crimes motivated by money, passion or boredom. Murder was murder; vandalism was vandalism. The term “hate crime” arose in response to what was described at the time as an “epidemic” of neo-Nazi and skinhead violence, although in retrospect it’s unclear whether any such epidemic existed. Since then, the number of bias-motivated prosecutions has steadily declined. In California, a state with close to 39 million people, hate-crime prosecutions have fallen 48 percent since 2003, with just 158 bias crimes filed for prosecution in 2012.

A majority of those charged with bias crimes do not fit the stereotype of the squinting, bristle-headed loner sporting a swastika tattoo. Researchers estimate that fewer than 5 percent are members of an organized hate group. Most are young males, either in their teens or early 20s, acting in a group. In a study of Boston hate-crime prosecutions in the early 1990s, two-thirds of the offenders were categorized as “thrill-seeking” — that is, they were groups of young people “looking for some fun” at the expense of someone they regarded as lower on the totem pole. The authors of the study found that many of these offenders weren’t even particularly biased toward their victims but were following the lead of a more biased peer.

Many hate crimes, according to Phyllis B. Gerstenfeld, a criminal-justice professor at California State University, Stanislaus, “don’t have as much to do with the victim as they do with the offender and their own insecurity — which of course is a lot of what’s going on with adolescents in general.”

Two groups that might have been expected to support O’Malley’s decision to charge Richard as an adult, the National Center for Lesbian Rights and the Transgender Law Center, wrote to her in November 2013, asking her to reconsider. “When juvenile impulsivity and poor judgment produce dire consequences, it does not make sense to craft a response intended for adults,” they said in a letter that was also sent on behalf of the A.C.L.U. of Northern California. “Rather, these are the very circumstances under which it is important to remember that children are different from adults.” The letter concluded: “We firmly believe that you can demonstrate your office’s commitment to protecting the victims of hate crimes without imposing adult sanctions on juvenile offenders.”

Richard’s first evidentiary hearing was in March. Sasha took the day off from school and came to court with Karl and Debbie, dressed in a navy blue skirt, a gray vest, a brown striped bow tie, a gray tweed cap, a trench coat and purple high tops. Richard’s mother was there, too. She had asked me in February if I could arrange a meeting with Sasha’s family, but when I broached the subject with Debbie, she recoiled and said she wasn’t ready. Now, in the vestibule outside the courtroom, Jasmine, a strikingly pretty woman with almond-shaped eyes and a high round forehead, came forward.

“My son’s not like that,” she said, the words tumbling out in a rush. “I don’t know what made him do that, and I’m sorry. We’re not hateful people.”

Then she hugged each member of the family: Debbie, Karl, Sasha. One by one, each of Richard’s relatives — aunts, uncles, cousins — came forward and did the same. When it was over, both mothers were crying.

Afterward, Jasmine kept talking about Sasha. “He just looked so innocent,” she said to me. “He’s just so cute. He has such a nice family. He didn’t deserve that. No kid does. It’s just not something I can get used to.” There was so much more that she had wanted to say to them, but she couldn’t find the words. “I don’t know what to say but sorry,” she told me.

Seven months later, on the morning of Oct. 16, Richard sat with his left leg shackled to a wooden chair in the courtroom of Judge Paul Delucchi. He wore a gray county-issue sweatshirt and khakis, and while he had lost the terrified look of his early court appearances, his eyes were wary. There was a faint peach-fuzz mustache on his upper lip.

Delucchi’s courtroom was frequently crowded and chaotic, with prisoners stacked up in the jury box listlessly waiting for their turn to appear. But each time Richard came to court, I watched his eyes rove the room, taking everything in. His lawyer had told me he was doing well in Alameda County Juvenile Hall, getting good grades and staying out of trouble. He was on track to graduate from high school in February. Jasmine visited him every Sunday.

Jasmine had stopped returning my calls, telling me in July that she was tired of talking about the case, tired of thinking about it, just tired. “I work 12, sometimes 14 hours a day, and when I come home, I just want to go to sleep,” she said. On that morning, she sat just behind me, wearing new long hair extensions with a greenish tint.

Debbie Crandall sat next to me, her eyes fixed on Richard. He was going to take a plea bargain. The mayhem charge and the hate-crime enhancements would be dropped, and Richard would receive a five-year sentence on the assault charge. With credit for time served and good behavior, the deal would have Richard, now 17, released before his 21st birthday, making it more likely that he could serve all his time in juvenile facilities. Du Bois had urged Richard to accept it as “the best choice among the available alternatives.” Debbie and Karl also wanted him to take the deal, so that Sasha, now a freshman at M.I.T., wouldn’t have to fly back for a trial.

Jasmine wasn’t so sure. She had hoped for a better outcome, and communication between her and Du Bois had grown increasingly poor over the summer and fall. Now she and Richard had decided to accept the offer.

But that morning, the deputy district attorney, Richard Moore, abruptly changed the five-year sentence to seven years. No explanation was given in court. Take it or go to trial, Du Bois said he was told. From my seat in the gallery, I watched Du Bois pull a chair in front of Richard to tell him the news. I could see the moment when Richard understood what had happened. He turned his head to look at Jasmine. They stared at each other for a long, heartbreaking moment, seeming to converse without words. When Richard turned back to face Du Bois, he curled his head into his shoulder. He would take the deal.

Du Bois, a 40-year courthouse veteran, was usually calm and even-tempered. But when I went to talk to him after the hearing, he was furious. Under the terms of the deal, Richard’s sentence may still be reduced to five years if he meets certain benchmarks between now and July — full participation in available educational and rehabilitation programs, a clean discipline record. But not all of that is in Richard’s control: Another inmate could pick a fight with him; a staff member might write him up for a minor offense. And because minors can be transferred to an adult prison as soon as they turn 18, a longer sentence makes it more likely that Richard will serve the bulk of his time in an adult prison rather than in juvenile facilities. “He’s now thrown to the wolves,” Du Bois told me. Weeks later, he was still fuming about Richard’s sentence. “It’s punitive,” he said. “And for what? Protecting the community by making this kid into a real gangster?”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

O’Malley told me over the phone in November that the new arrangement was meant to help him, by giving him more time to receive treatment. She could not, however, name the type of treatment programs she had in mind for Richard or explain how sending him to adult prison would serve the rehabilitation goals she had described.

Richard returned to court a month later for sentencing. Debbie had been asked to give a victim-impact statement. She read aloud a letter to Richard, her voice quavering. “You attacked our child as they slept on a bus,” she began. “Maybe you thought it was weird that Sasha was wearing a skirt.” Richard’s gaze stayed on her face as she described Sasha’s ordeal — the charred skin, the painful skin grafts, the hours of daily bandaging. His eyes filled with tears.

“We do not understand your actions,” Debbie went on. “But we also think that hatred only leads to more hatred and anger. We don’t want you to come out of prison full of hate.”

Debbie and Karl walked out of the courthouse into the November sunshine and stopped for coffee at a nearby sidewalk cafe. They were exhausted from talking to reporters, unsure whether to be relieved or distraught. “I wish it had turned out differently for Richard,” Debbie said. “We got Sasha back. But poor Jasmine. She lost her son for years.” They hadn’t expected to be so moved by seeing Richard’s face again.

“I just had this wave of emotion at how young he looked,” Karl said. “He just looks like a kid.”",nytimes.com,True

Irreverent magazines like Charlie Hebdo have been a fixture in Western societies for many years, and France has a strong tradition of such journalism.

The Internet, moreover, has opened the door to almost every level and form of expression.

Yet there are legitimate questions raised about freedom of expression in this tragedy.

In the wake of the terror attack, French authorities began aggressive enforcements of a law against supporting or justifying terrorism, including arrests of people who spoke admiringly about the shootings at Charlie Hebdo. Not surprisingly, their actions have raised questions of a double standard — one for cartoonists who deliberately insult religion, when their cartoons are certain to antagonize Muslims at a time when anti-Muslim feelings are already at high levels in France and across much of Europe, and another for those who react by applauding terrorists.

The difference, according to French authorities, is between the right to attack an idea and the right to attack people or incite hatred.

The distinction is recognized in the various laws against hate speech or inciting violence that exist in most Western states.

As a consequence of World War II, France and several other European countries have laws against denying the Holocaust, and with a rise in anti-Semitism in France, authorities have actively sought to curb hate speech, like the anti-Semitic routines of a comedian, Dieudonné M’bala M’bala.

Freedom of expression is broader in the United States, but there, too, there are legal limitations on speech that involves incitement, libel, obscenity or child pornography.

But drawing the line between speech that is disgusting and speech that is dangerous is inherently difficult and risky.

In Israel, mocking Muhammad can bring a prison term, as it did for Tatiana Susskind, a Russian immigrant who posted drawings of the Prophet as a pig in Hebron in 1997.

She was accused, among other things, of committing a racist act and harming religious sensitivities, and sentenced to two years in prison.

Tastes, standards and situations change, and in the end it is best for editors and societies at large to judge what is fit — or safe — to print.

That the tragedy in Paris has served to raise these questions is in no way an insult to the members of the Charlie Hebdo staff who perished.

There are few places where the turn against immigrants is more surprising than Sweden, where a solid core of citizens still supports the 65-year-old open door policy toward immigrants facing hardship that has long earned international respect for the country.

Opposition to the rising numbers is growing. The far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats had their best showing ever — nearly 13 percent of votes — in elections in September.

The party’s growth has occurred despite the fact that roughly a fifth of Sweden’s 9.6 million people were born abroad or to immigrant parents in Sweden. Most immigrants here have access to education, but government figures show a disproportionate unemployment rate for them, more than twice the national rate of about 8 percent. The disparity helped fuel riots in immigrant neighborhoods outside Stockholm in 2013.

In Germany, another anti-immigrant movement is underway. In recent weeks, a group calling itself the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West has attracted as many as 17,500 people to rallies that demand stifling of immigration.

BERLIN — A basement room used as a place of worship by Muslims in a southern Swedish town was destroyed by a fire on Monday, officials and the imam for the town said. It was the second time in the past week that an Islamic worship center was damaged by a fire in Sweden, where a far-right party with an anti-immigration stance has been gaining support and influence.

A statement from the police in the county of Skane said they were investigating possible causes, including arson. The fire broke out early Monday in the basement of an apartment block in Eslov, about 20 miles northeast of Malmo, a city of about 260,000 in southern Sweden. No one was injured in the fire, which was quickly extinguished, the police said.

For decades, Sweden has been among the most welcoming European countries for refugees from around the world, but in recent years that tradition of openness has been tested as the influx has strained the welfare system, schools and housing. As a result, the right-wing Sweden Democrats party, which campaigns on an anti-immigration platform, has become the country’s third largest.

The party this month nearly toppled the center-left government of Prime Minister Stefan Lofven by voting with the center-right against the national budget. Over the weekend, Mr. Lofven reached a deal with the center-right by adopting its budget, thus avoiding early elections that could have strengthened the Sweden Democrats.",nytimes.com,True

LONDON — With fears of racially motivated violence on the rise in Europe, political leaders in Sweden on Friday condemned a suspected arson attack at a mosque that injured five people and raised tension in a country where immigration has become a significant political issue.

The fire broke out at the mosque, in a residential area in the town of Eskilstuna, about 70 miles west of Stockholm, on Thursday with 15 to 20 people inside.

The country’s justice minister, Morgan Johansson, called the suspected arson “disgusting” and told Swedish Radio News that he hoped the culprits would be arrested. Though the motive is still unclear, he added that it was hard to ascribe it to anything other than hatred toward Muslims as a group, and Islam as a religion.

Alice Bah Kuhnke, Sweden’s culture minister, told the radio station, “If the details are correct, then it is a direct attack against religious freedom in our country.” The station’s website also reported that Prime Minister Stefan Löfven called the attack reprehensible and said more must be done to stop attacks against Muslims and places of worship.

The victim, Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein, 15, was killed outside a Somali community center here.

According to a probable-cause statement, the suspect, Ahmed H. Aden, 34, of Kansas City, struck the teenager as he got into a car. A witness reported seeing the boy “fly through the air” before the S.U.V. ran over him. His legs were nearly severed, and he died in a hospital of his wounds.

Prosecutors were requesting a $250,000 bond. No lawyer was listed for Mr. Aden in online court records.

In the weeks before the crash, worshipers at the center said, they saw a black S.U.V. painted with threatening messages at the community center and cruising around a nearby shopping area. One of the messages was “Islam is worse than Ebola,” said Mohamed Ahmed, 13.

When he and his housemate, who is also from Pakistan, began cleaning up the next morning, small groups of neighbors had formed. But they had not come to help — they had come to gloat.

Then one of them began raining blows down on Mr. Khattack amid a tirade of racist slurs.

“He was a big guy and he approached me, and at this point I called the police to report trespass as he was inside the gate,” Mr. Khattack said. “But he grabbed me in a headlock and began punching me and jumping on my legs. I managed to get into the house, but he followed me through the door until I got to the bathroom and there he continued to beat me.”

Mr. Khattack was treated for severe bruising and spent months on crutches. He still walks with a limp.

The police arrested a 57-year-old man, who was later released on bail. The police told Mr. Khattack that the man had since fled the area.

The official figures and anecdotal evidence indicate that the severity and frequency of attacks in Northern Ireland have increased in recent years.

On average, almost three racial hate crimes a day are reported to the police. Between 2013 and 2014 there was a 43 percent increase in racially motivated offenses, 70 percent of them in Belfast. Immigrant groups assert — and the police concede — that the real figure is much higher, with many attacks going unrecorded because of fear of reprisals or a lack of faith in the justice system.

According to a recent report by the Northern Ireland Commission for Ethnic Minorities, just 12 of 14,000 race-related crimes reported over the past five years ended in a successful prosecution.

The police say paramilitary groups are cynically manipulating xenophobia to gain support in their communities by targeting migrants. In April, a senior police officer, Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr, said the rise in the number and severity of racial hate crimes in Protestant loyalist areas left “the unpleasant taste of a bit of ethnic cleansing.”

But Patrick Yu, the executive director of the Northern Ireland Commission for Ethnic Minorities, said it is simplistic to brand certain communities intrinsically racist.

“Most of the available housing stock for private rental just happens to be in loyalist areas where there is already a wariness of outsiders and a feeling of being left behind by Catholics who they believe have benefited disproportionately from the Good Friday Agreement,” he said. “There is still huge deprivation in these areas, and I believe sectarianism and racism are two sides of the same coin — both need to be tackled.”

Although less prevalent, attacks have also taken place in Catholic west Belfast. In June, hundreds of people marched in the area in support of a Nigerian man who was hospitalized after a racist assault. His attackers had also threatened to run over his 2-year-old daughter and burn down his home.

There is also concern that casual racism and willful ignorance are pervasive, evident in the flying of a Ku Klux Klan flag in loyalist east Belfast in July. Also that month, the Ulster Rugby team apologized for a picture in which three of its players were wearing black makeup and one had chains around his neck as if he were a slave.

This summer, a fundamentalist Protestant preacher, James McConnell, drew widespread condemnation after telling his congregation that “Islam is heathen; Islam is satanic; Islam is a doctrine spawned in hell.”

Anna Lo, the only ethnic minority representative in the Northern Ireland Assembly, recalls the night she heard the province’s first minister, Peter Robinson, speak in support of Mr. McConnell, saying “there wasn’t an ounce of hatred in his bones.”

“I was screaming at the television,” she said in an interview. “I couldn’t believe these views.”

Mr. Robinson’s remarks prompted Ms. Lo to make an emotional appearance on a popular talk show in which she said she was considering leaving the country. Ms. Lo, who was born in Hong Kong, has lived in Northern Ireland since 1984. “What kind of place are we now living in?” she said. “I feel vulnerable that when I walk on the street I might be attacked.”

Both men eventually apologized for their remarks.

In Britain, immigrants make up roughly 12.4 percent of the population, compared with 1.8 percent in Northern Ireland. Still, the rate here is higher than the 0.8 percent in 2001, with the bulk of the immigrants coming from Poland after it joined the European Union in 2004.

Many immigrants say the abuse is tolerated for economic reasons: Workers here can expect to earn far more than in their home countries.

Others cannot go back even if they wanted to. “I acknowledge that it is somewhat ironic that I seem to have swapped fear in my own country for another kind here,” said Suleiman Abdulahi, who fled Somalia after the outbreak of civil war there in 1991.

The new wave of immigrants has certainly not brought safety in numbers.

“It’s my home, but I don’t feel like a very welcome resident,” said Ms. Olorunda, whose broad accent is pure Northern Ireland.

“When more people began to arrive I was excited at first,” she said, “but then the attacks began to move from verbal to physical and I began to think this isn’t a good thing, after all.”

Ms. Olorunda said she has endured a lifetime of racism and stays in Northern Ireland mainly to look after her mother, who she said never recovered from the loss of her husband. He died in 1980 when an Irish Republican Army bomb exploded on a train.

In a twist that shows just how small this society can be, Ms. Olorunda’s mother, a nurse, met the badly disfigured man responsible for her husband’s death in a hospital some years later. She accepted his apology, even though she had been left alone to bring up three young daughters.

Holden Whitehead, a linebacker on the college football team, then held one end of the fabric between his teeth, as Mr. Singh circled him clockwise, enfolding the student’s hair in a turban.

And, oh, by the way, Mr. Singh was doing this while wearing a Captain America costume, about which more will be said later. Costume or not, Mr. Singh had planted on Mr. Whitehead’s skull not just a form of headwear but an epiphany or two.

“I’ve heard of the Sikh religion before, but I didn’t know anything,” said Mr. Whitehead, 20, who was taking a class on diversity and comic art. “Like everyone else, I thought it was Arab.”

In this moment of role reversal, it was the white guy from Lock Haven, Pa., who was thrust into the role of being the visible other. “If you’re proud of your religion, just rock it,” Mr. Whitehead said. “But it must be hard to keep your composure, dealing with all the stares.”

Stares would qualify as the benign end of the spectrum for many American Sikhs, who follow a monotheistic religion founded in South Asia about 600 years ago. Because they are so often mistaken for fundamentalist or even jihadist Muslims — the turban being associated with the leaders of Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and the Islamic State — American Sikhs have endured a substantial amount of hate crime. While the F.B.I. does not break down separate statistics for attacks against Sikhs specifically, the last 13 years have seen numerous beatings and several killings, most notoriously the fatal shooting of six worshipers at a Sikh temple outside Milwaukee in 2012.

Mr. Singh has made it his mission, in deeply felt and highly idiosyncratic ways, to address the ignorance and thus defang the hate. To understand the depth of his conviction, it helps to return to his childhood. Born in Washington, the son of a civil servant in the Indian Embassy, Mr. Singh moved back to Delhi with his family for his schooling. When he was in seventh grade, a wave of anti-Sikh violence engulfed the city — partly provoked by the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by two bodyguards who were Sikh, but also abetted by some members of the police and government.

As a boy of 13, Mr. Singh peered through the curtained windows of his family’s apartment at a Hindu gang trying to break into the building. Ultimately, a Hindu neighbor hid and sheltered the Singhs for several days until the worst violence abated. By then, several thousand Sikhs had been killed, many burned alive, and tens of thousands had fled their homes. To this day, Sikhs like Mr. Singh refer to the events as a pogrom rather than merely a riot.

The memory of human nature at its worst and its best, of marauding mobs and compassionate neighbors, stayed with Mr. Singh even as he returned to the United States for college, then earned a graduate degree and began a career in computer engineering. What did fall away in those years was his boyhood love of cartooning, which seemed like no way to make a living.

After the Sept. 11 attacks, though, Mr. Singh found himself compelled to resume drawing, to put his pleas for tolerance in the easily digestible form of comics. Techie that he was, he sketched with his index finger on a laptop’s touch pad and posted the resulting work online. By the end of 2002, he had produced enough cartoons to start a website, sikhtoons.com, which eventually attracted about 1,500 unique visitors a day.

Trying to promote his artwork, Mr. Singh attended the New York Comic Con in 2011. For the occasion, he drew up a poster of Captain America, the patriotic character originally created for World War II’s struggle against fascism, but with a Sikh’s turban and beard. A year later, after the mass shootings at the Sikh temple in Wisconsin, Mr. Singh wrote an op-ed column for The Seattle Times, declaring, “It’s time for a new superhero to fight hate crimes.”

The blowback online from readers — “dumb column,” “race obsessed left,” “ ‘hate crimes’ is a political invention” — only fortified Mr. Singh’s commitment. He ordered a Captain America outfit and then found a tailor to do alterations for his alter ego, trimming its XL dimensions for his 5-foot-9, 125-pound frame.

Sometimes in his casual jeans, sometimes in his neon-bright outfit, always with his turban and beard, Mr. Singh has taken his message about Sikhs and tolerance to audiences from the University of Kansas to the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles to the satirical television show “Totally Biased.” At Alfred University, which runs a special program called “Drawn to Diversity,” he found an especially receptive audience for his speech, cartoon presentation and turban-tying workshop. His performance-art stroll through the campus became the occasion for many selfies, fist-bumps and iterations of “Awesome, dude!”

Re “At Gateway to Hamptons, Ku Klux Klan Advertises for New Members” (news article, Aug. 30):

It should come as no surprise to see the Ku Klux Klan in the Hamptons. The Klan has had an active constituency on Long Island since the 1920s, even running political slates for local office in Sag Harbor, Brookhaven and elsewhere.

The Hamptons have always been fertile ground for prejudice and reactionary behavior, as changing demographics inspired fear and violent backlash against newcomers, primarily those of the working class.

But as I argued in my book “The End of the Hamptons: Scenes From the Class Struggle in America’s Paradise,” periodic flare-ups after “trigger events” (like the beating of Hampton day laborers in 2000) often obscure the basic fact that race, ethnicity and class form constant barriers for minorities on the East End.

Despite heroic efforts by activists and everyday people alike, the effect of racial and ethnic discrimination remains an intransigent part of our increasingly unequal society. Only a vigilant and unapologetic movement of people demanding equality and not just tolerance can create a culture where the tragedy of Ferguson, Mo., or hate crimes in the Hamptons happen only in history books.

But the appeals panel ruled that the judge should have told jurors that, for the attacks to be a hate crime, the religion of the victim must be the predominant motivating factor, and said the evidence did not support that conclusion.

“When all is said and done, considerable evidence supported the defendants’ theory that interpersonal and intrafamily disagreements, not the victims’ religious beliefs, sparked the attacks,” the appeals court ruled.

At the trial, the defendants did not deny that they had carried out the attacks, jumping people who had criticized Mr. Mullet as a cult leader, forcing them down, and shearing off the beards of men and the long hair of women. While Mr. Mullet did not take part in the assaults, the government portrayed him as the mastermind.

Beards and long hair are central to Amish identity, and the attacks were widely seen as an effort to humiliate the victims. Members of Mr. Mullet’s small community in Bergholz, Ohio, later said that they had engaged in beard- and hair-cutting among themselves, as well, to punish hypocrites and force them to re-evaluate their faith. But they also described a series of family conflicts and a bitter custody battle that had led to enmities with other Amish and a fervent desire to strike out at critics.

Defense lawyers had sought a more sweeping repudiation of the government’s decision to invoke the federal hate-crimes statute, with its stringent penalties, in a dispute among feuding members of the same religion. But the circuit judges confined their decision to the jury instructions and what they called a lack of evidence that religion was the primary motivating factor.

And while agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation have interviewed Mr. Tum and other potential witnesses, a spokesman for the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, which includes Long Island, declined to comment on the matter.

Mr. Tum, 37, an immigrant from Guatemala, said in a recent interview that he and Mr. Sánchez, who was from El Salvador, had known each other for about a year and were roommates in a house in Mastic, N.Y., at the time of the attack. On Oct. 5, 2010, he recalled, he met up with Mr. Sánchez, who was 33, and several other acquaintances, all of them Latino immigrants, in Shirley around 4 p.m. The gathering place was a small trash-strewn stand of trees wedged between the back of a bowling alley and William Floyd Parkway, a busy four-lane road.

Sitting on an old, torn mattress in a spot about 50 yards from the road and 25 yards from a parking lot, they downed tequila and Bud Light.

Hours later, Mr. Tum said, he passed out on a small mound of dirt, several yards away from the other men. He remembers waking up to find someone’s hands on him. He said it felt like someone was trying to insert a needle in his arm. And then, he said, he felt people punching him. He lurched to his feet, bolted from the woods and ran to the Mastic Shirley train station, about a mile north along William Floyd Parkway, to seek help.

Paramedics found him “lying on the ground at the train station,” according to his admission report at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center in Patchogue, where Mr. Tum was brought at 5:24 a.m. on Oct. 6. “He admits to being intoxicated with alcohol for the past two days,” the report continued. “He does not remember what happened.”

It is unclear what investigative steps the police took following Mr. Tum’s appearance at the train station. According to a Suffolk County police news release, Mr. Sánchez’s body was not found until much later that day: A group of people walking through the stand of trees behind the bowling alley discovered the corpse and called the police at 5:25 p.m., the report said.

José Zelaya, the owner of a diner located near where the men were drinking, said he had known Mr. Sánchez for several years and hired him from time to time to do small jobs around the restaurant, usually in exchange for food. When Mr. Zelaya was out of town, Mr. Sánchez — who was known by the nickname Chiquito — would stop by around closing time and walk Mr. Zelaya’s wife to her car to ensure her safety.

At the time of the attack, Suffolk County was under scrutiny by the United States Justice Department, which had opened an investigation into allegations of discriminatory policing, including claims that county police officials had failed to thoroughly investigate allegations of crimes committed against Latinos.

The inquiry had begun in 2009, prompted in part by the killing a year earlier of Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant whom a group of teenagers stabbed to death. The Justice Department and Suffolk County signed an accord last December requiring that new policies be put in place to ensure nondiscriminatory policing and greater police outreach to the Latino community.

Mr. Sánchez’s death came to the attention of the county’s hate crimes unit the day his body was found. At the time, Detective Sgt. Robert Reecks, who died in August 2011, was the head of the unit.

According to his widow, Rita Reecks, Sergeant Reecks told her that an off-duty officer working as a security guard at a nearby library the night of the attack had spotted several teenagers entering and leaving the woods. Sergeant Reecks also told her that he had retrieved video from the library’s security cameras that captured the teenagers’ movements. But a couple of weeks after the episode, she said in an interview, he was pulled off the case. Sergeant Reecks later died when the car he was driving slammed into a bridge abutment. The authorities concluded that the death was a suicide.

For his part, Mr. Tum said that while he was still in the hospital, he was questioned by a police officer. Shortly after he was discharged, he was interviewed again, this time by several police investigators, who, he said, showed him photographs of Mr. Sánchez on the mattress, a long, sharpened wooden stick by his side.

“They said, ‘You killed José Sánchez,’ ” Mr. Tum recalled. “I said, ‘I’m innocent.’ ”

“I don’t believe there’s three missing,” he sputters. “I believe it’s a publicity stunt.”

Then Hoover calls the president to report that the F.B.I. has found the Ford station wagon that the three had been riding in. “The car was burned,” he says, “and we do not know yet whether any bodies are inside of the car because of the intense heat that still is in the area of the car.

The French government has laudably stepped up efforts to counter the threats posed by French citizens involved with radical Muslim groups (“Fearing Converts to Terrorism, France Intercepts Citizens Bound for Syria,” news article, June 3). But trying to prevent citizens inspired by a twisted jihadist ideology from traveling to Syria, or tracking those who return to France motivated to commit violence, is only part of the challenge, albeit a big one.

Initiatives are urgently needed to prevent the emergence of another Mohammed Merah, who murdered four Jews and three soldiers in Toulouse in 2012, or Mehdi Nemmouche, arrested in France for the fatal terror attack at the Brussels Jewish Museum last month, or another who may be lying in wait.

The Brussels gunman, who killed three Jews, seems to have been first exposed to radicalism in French prisons, and then spent a year in Syria with jihadist forces.

Indoctrination in extremist ideologies in prisons demands utmost attention — for example, who are the chaplains? — as does recruitment by radical, violent groups on social media and in mosques. The French government cannot do it alone and will require active involvement by political, religious and civil society leaders.

In recent weeks, the radicalism has broadened and spilled over into Israel proper with a rash of vandalistic hate crimes against Arab property and Muslim and Christian holy sites. The recent acts, ranging from puncturing car tires and spray-painting racist slogans to committing arson, have not resulted in injury so far but have stoked tensions.

The State Department’s annual terrorism report, published last month, included a section on Price Tag attacks for the first time, recording nearly 400 attacks in 2013, based on data gathered by the United Nations, and noting that they went “largely unprosecuted.”

Intensive police and intelligence work have at times managed to foil attacks and rein in the scope of the militants. But Israeli security officials say that given the complexities involved, they do not expect to be able to stamp out Price Tag completely.

“In a democratic country I don’t think it is possible to wipe out the mind-set of people,” said a security official in a rare briefing on the subject.

The official, who was speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the nature of his work, said he viewed even the puncturing of tires and offensive graffiti as a form of terrorism because it was intended to deter the government from carrying out its policies through antidemocratic means and violence. He said the provocateurs had moved over to “soft” attacks on easy targets, often with little relation to the settlement outposts, because they achieved the same effects with minimal risk.

Efforts to prosecute suspects have been hampered by their refusal to talk during interrogations. Often, because the crimes require little more than a screwdriver, some gasoline or a can of spray paint, the police lack evidence that would hold up in court. Adding to the difficulty, Price Tag is a diffuse movement with no real hierarchy.

Last year, the defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, designated Price Tag as an illegal association, giving the authorities the legal means to deny suspects under interrogation immediate access to a lawyer. But security and justice ministry officials said that, as well as administrative detention, were considered draconian measures to be used only in exceptional circumstances.

Another tool used by the authorities, issuing warrants barring known troublemakers from the West Bank for periods of up to six months, became less effective over time as the activists moved their operations inside Israel.

Israel’s justice minister, Tzipi Livni, and the public security minister, Yitzhak Aharonovitch, held an emergency meeting last week on the subject, attended by the attorney general and representatives of the police, the military and the Shin Bet internal security agency. They suggested classifying Price Tag as a terrorist organization.

That would not provide the authorities with any additional legal tools, officials said, but might have a psychological impact.

The authorities consider Yitzhar, a settlement in the northern West Bank, as a source of the Price Tag movement, which emerged after Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and the evacuation all the Jewish settlements there.

In April, the Israeli military deployed troops in the Od Yosef Chai Yeshiva, a Yitzhar seminary considered a hotbed of extremism, after radical settlers clashed with Israeli forces dispatched to demolish illegal buildings in Yitzhar’s outposts. A young woman from Yitzhar was briefly detained this month for possible incitement to violence after she wrote an email, on an internal forum, justifying throwing stones at Israeli forces who came to evacuate outposts even if it resulted in the death of a soldier. Many others in Yitzhar, however, came out strongly against such sentiments.

Last year a special unit was set up in the Israel police’s West Bank division to contend with the problem.

But Yuval Diskin, who served as the Shin Bet chief until 2011, recently wrote on his Facebook page that in addition to law enforcement, settlement leaders and rabbis must act to root out those involved in Price Tag.

In Yokneam, a predominantly Jewish town in northern Israel, a local man was recently caught puncturing the tires of a car belonging to an Arab citizen, the police said, adding that he was suspected in a string of recent hate crimes in the area.

While five episodes of racist vandalism were recorded in Israel proper in 2012 and seven in 2013, the number rose sharply this year, to at least 20 so far, according to official data. Activities escalated in April and May after the demolitions of illegal structures in Yitzhar and included an attempt to set fire to a mosque in the populous Arab Israeli town of Umm al-Fahm.

Four residents of Yitzhar were arrested in connection with the Umm al-Fahm attack, after the car used by the perpetrators was captured on footage from a security camera. But they refused to answer questions and in the absence of conclusive evidence, all have since been released.

A former New York City police officer was arrested Sunday and charged with spray-painting anti-Semitic messages on more than a dozen cars and several buildings in Brooklyn.

The police questioned the man, Michael Setiawan, in the 66th Precinct station house for hours about profane messages that had been scrawled in pink letters across cars and on walls in a section of Borough Park, Brooklyn, where many Orthodox Jews live.

Mr. Setiawan, 36, was charged with criminal mischief as a hate crime and aggravated harassment as a hate crime.

Mr. Setiawan, of Bellerose, Queens, was a police officer for two years before resigning in 2007; he was last assigned to a precinct in Canarsie, Brooklyn. The reason he left the department was not immediately clear.

He is expected to face full charges in the coming days.

Speculation about the murders had been coursing through gay circles in Lahore since mid-March, when the first killing took place. “People are quite frightened,” said one gay man, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the law against homosexuality. “They feel both violated and exposed.”

Another man said there was speculation that the victims had been picked up on Grindr, another popular social networking website. “Some of my friends deleted their profiles because they were worried,” he said.

Mr. Ejaz denied police claims that he had had sex with his victims before killing them, claiming instead that sexual abuse he had suffered as a teenager had driven him to act.

While his arrest removed a security worry for some gay men and lesbians, it also raised fears that hostile news media coverage could lead to restrictions on the use of networking sites.

“The reporting has a very moralistic tone,” another gay man said. “They’re talking about how people are being picked up on the Internet as if it’s a new thing. But it’s been going on for years.”

Gay men and lesbians occupy a complex place in Pakistani society. Although homosexual acts are outlawed and carry a potential life sentence, prosecutions are rare. Gay men typically hide their sexuality from family members, out of fear of being ostracized. Yet at the same time, they meet openly at private parties and even religious shrines, and some post photographs of themselves on websites like Manjam. One man told a BBC reporter last year that Pakistan was a “gay man’s paradise.”

But these freedoms are exercised within tightly defined limits, and discrimination and prejudice still run deep, particularly for lesbians, because women generally enjoy fewer social freedoms than men in Pakistani society.

One lesbian, writing anonymously in a newspaper blog in 2011, said she felt that she had been treated like a criminal. “You are considered as disgusting as filth, as unnatural as molestation, as uncouth as an animal,” she wrote.

Police investigators said they traced Mr. Ejaz using his victims’ mobile phone records and, using a false identity, lured him last week to an apartment in Lahore where he was arrested.

In the interview, Mr. Ejaz said he started browsing social networking sites for gay men this year, after getting an Internet-capable mobile phone.

I’ve been thinking about my grandfather and his gun these past few weeks, ever since a mob outside a gas station in Detroit beat up a man who had accidentally hit a child with his truck after the kid stepped into traffic, perhaps playing a game of chicken. When the driver stopped to come to the aid of the child, he was attacked.

After what happened, I suspect lots of people in Detroit are getting guns. And if they’re not getting guns, then for sure they’re not stopping for gas.

The motorist, Steve Utash, was white. The mob, witnesses say, was made up of a dozen black men. A crowd of onlookers gathered while the mob beat Mr. Utash within an inch of his life. He was saved by Deborah Hughes, a black woman and a retired nurse who carries a .38. After attending to the child, who was not critically injured, Ms. Hughes lay across the body of Mr. Utash and promised herself that she would put a bullet in the next person to strike him.

Four adult men were bound over for trial this week and charged with intent to murder. A teenager has also been charged with ethnic intimidation. Mr. Utash spent nine days in a coma, and is now conscious and recovering in the hospital.

Was the beating race-related? Probably. This is America, after all. This is Detroit. We have a history. The city has endured three major race riots. In my lifetime I remember two out-of-work white autoworkers in 1982 beating a Chinese-American man to death because they thought he was Japanese. In the early 1990s, white cops went to prison for beating a black motorist to death. Last year, a white man shot a black woman to death after her car broke down and she was wandering the neighborhood, presumably looking for help. Now this. So the circle spins on. Black mob. White fear. More guns.

Sadly, the talk after the attack on Mr. Utash wasn’t about a man who stopped to do the right thing. It wasn’t about Ms. Hughes, the gun-toting angel of mercy who saw no color except the red of his blood. It wasn’t about the use of justifiable force or the value of carrying a sidearm.

Instead white people asked: Where were the old-school civil rights advocates who usually spoke out against such beatings? Where was Reverend Al? Why did it take Jesse Jackson almost two weeks to say something? Not that any of them really wanted famous civil rights leaders coming to town and marching around. What they seemed to be demanding was an admission from black leaders that blacks harbor racial hatred, too.

But leaders nationally and in Detroit stayed curiously silent. A medical fund was established for Mr. Utash, but it took more than a week to convene a vigil for him as he lay in a coma. Until that vigil not even Mike Duggan — the first elected white mayor of Detroit in 40 years — made a public appearance about it. (Though he did put out a press release and a tweet.) Nor did any City Council person that I’m aware of. And nothing from President Obama. Rage and hopelessness are no excuses here. All Detroit, whether black or white, noticed the silence.

The fact is, it’s often hard to be white in America, too, especially in a struggling city like Detroit. Just ask the Utash family.

Three black men I spoke with at the gas station a few days after the beating acknowledged this two-way street. They called Mr. Utash an honorable man for stopping to help when too many people in this city don’t. They mocked the silence of civic leaders. They wanted to know why the mayor had not come to their neighborhood. They knew the score. They’re Americans. And they also know that we can’t expect those leaders to solve this riddle of ours called race.

No one called the police.

There they came upon Mr. Patterson, who was passing through on his way home to Fort Greene. Believing him to be the vandal, the men chased Mr. Patterson down the avenue before cornering and detaining him.

Later that year he took part (but was not charged) in a deadly shooting of Communist protesters in Greensboro, N.C.

In 1980, Mr. Miller formed a Klan-affiliated organization in North Carolina that eventually was known as the White Patriot Party. He outfitted members in camouflage fatigues. He paraded his neo-Nazis, in uniform and bearing arms, up and down streets. They patrolled schools and polling places, supposedly to protect whites from harassment. F.B.I. documents show that they also burned crosses. By 1986, Mr. Miller’s group claimed 2,500 members in five southern states.

The archives also show that Mr. Miller received large sums of money from The Order, a white power group in the Pacific Northwest, to buy land and weapons to put his followers through paramilitary training. Mr. Miller’s group paid $50,000 for weapons and matériel stolen from the armory at Fort Bragg, N.C., including anti-tank rockets, mines and plastic explosives. He targeted active-duty troops for recruitment and hired them to conduct training exercises.

Mr. Miller’s downfall came after the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit on behalf of black North Carolinians; as part of a settlement in 1985, he agreed to stop operating a paramilitary organization. In 1987, a federal judge found that Mr. Miller had violated the agreement, and barred him from contacting others in the white power movement. Outraged, and anticipating criminal charges regarding the stolen military weapons, Mr. Miller briefly went underground. He would write in a self-published autobiography, “Since they wouldn’t allow me to fight them legally above ground, then I’d resort to the only means left, armed revolution.” He was later caught with a small arsenal, but he began cooperating with prosecutors, testifying against other white supremacists in exchange for a reduced sentence. He was released in 1990, after serving three years.

In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security issued a nine-page report detailing the threat of domestic terrorism by the white power movement. This short document outlined no specific threats, but rather a set of historical factors that had predicted white-supremacist activity in the past — like economic pressure, opposition to immigration and gun-control legislation — and a new factor, the election of a black president.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The report singled out one factor that has fueled every surge in Ku Klux Klan membership in American history, from the 1860s to the present: war. The return of veterans from combat appears to correlate more closely with Klan membership than any other historical factor. “Military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists carrying out violent attacks,” the report warned. The agency was “concerned that right-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize returning veterans in order to boost their violent capabilities.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The report raised intense blowback from the American Legion, Fox News and conservative members of Congress. They demanded an apology and denounced the idea that any veteran could commit an act of domestic terrorism. The department shelved the report, removing it from its website. The threat, however, proved real.

Mr. Miller obviously represents an extreme, both in his politics and in his violence. A vast majority of veterans are neither violent nor mentally ill. When they turn violent, they often harm themselves, by committing suicide. But it would be irresponsible to overlook the high rates of combat trauma among the 2.4 million Americans who have served in our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the full impact of which has not yet materialized. Veterans of those conflicts represent just 10 percent of those getting mental health services through the Department of Veterans Affairs, where the overwhelming majority of those in treatment are still Vietnam veterans.

During Mr. Miller’s long membership in the white power movement, its leaders have robbed armored cars, engaged in counterfeiting and the large-scale theft of military weapons, and carried out or planned killings. The bombing by Timothy J. McVeigh, an Army veteran, of the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, which killed 168 people, was only the most dramatic of these crimes. When we interpret shootings like the one on Sunday as acts of mad, lone-wolf gunmen, we fail to see white power as an organized — and deadly — social movement.

That Mr. Miller was able to carry out an act of domestic terror at two locations despite his history of violent behavior should alarm anyone concerned about public safety. Would he have received greater scrutiny had he been a Muslim, a foreigner, not white, not a veteran? The answer is clear, and alarming.",nytimes.com,True

Some relatives and friends of the victims who did not attend court on Tuesday said they were trying to focus on the lives that were lost and not on the man who officials say took them.

“It takes no character to do what was done,” Will Corporon, a son and uncle to the first two victims, told reporters at a family news conference this week. “It takes no strength of character. It takes no backbone. It takes no morals. It takes no ethics. All it takes is an idiot with a gun, so there’s no need to focus on that.”

A short time later, Terri LaManno, 53, who was visiting her mother at the nearby Village Shalom assisted living facility, was also killed.

Although the shooting suspect, Frazier Glenn Miller, was a known racist and anti-Semite with ties to the Ku Klux Klan, the victims who were gunned down on Sunday were all Christians, devoted to their families, to their churches and to serving their Kansas City communities.

Ms. LaManno worked as an occupational therapist for children with visual impairments. She sat with them one on one for hours — from their infancy until age 10 — teaching them fine-motor skills.

And always, her co-workers said, she expressed gratitude for what she had in her life, particularly for children. She had two daughters: one grown, the other set to graduate from college this year. Her son, a sophomore at Kansas State University, also volunteered at the Children’s Center for the Visually Impaired, where Ms. LaManno worked.

“She was this beautiful, caring, gracious spirit,” said Nicola Heskett, executive director of the center. “That spirit of giving back, she was instilling in her children.”

Co-workers and friends described Ms. LaManno as a consummate nurturer, someone who would shuttle her father-in-law to his doctor’s appointments, and happily take on whatever was asked of her at work.

“Of course she was there seeing her mom because that’s Terri,” Ms. Heskett said. “That’s what Terri did. She took care of everyone.”

Dr. Corporon, too, had made a career out of helping children, often starting at their very first breath. As a family doctor for 30 years in Oklahoma, he was the first to touch scores of newborn babies, his son Will Corporon said Monday.

Dr. Corporon’s own family came first, however. And in 2003, he and his wife left Oklahoma, moving north to be closer to their grandchildren in Johnson County, Kan. (though the family remained devoted fans of the Oklahoma Sooners).

“They were together all the time, my father and Reat, and the other grandkids,” Will Corporon said.

Reat had big plans this year.

There was the long-awaited audition for KC SuperStar. But he also had theater productions, in school and out. He was working toward becoming an Eagle Scout and was looking forward to debate camp in the summer.

Somehow, amid all of this, he volunteered at his Methodist church, where he would watch the young children, playing with them or reading Bible stories, while their parents were in services.

“He had a really full life for a 14-year-old, and we were very blessed,” his mother, Mindy Corporon, said. “He loved his school, and he loved his friends.”

She said Reat had already signed up to be an organ donor when he got his learner’s permit.

“This isn’t easy,” Ms. Corporon said. But she added that she took great solace in her faith, and in the moments before he left for the audition.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation keeps statistics, the most recent of which are for 2012. In the United States that year there were 6,573 hate-crime incidents reported to the bureau (a fraction, no doubt, of all that occurred). While most were motivated by race, about 20 percent were motivated by the victims’ perceived religion — roughly the same percentage as those motivated by the victims’ presumed sexual orientation. I didn’t expect a number that high.

Nor did I expect this: Of the religion-prompted hate crimes, 65 percent were aimed at Jews, a share relatively unchanged from five years earlier (69 percent) and another five before that (65 percent). In contrast, 11 percent of religious-bias crimes in 2012 were against Muslims.

Our country has come so far from the anti-Semitism of decades ago that we tend to overlook the anti-Semitism that endures. We’ve moved on to fresher discussions, newer fears.

Following 9/11, there was enormous concern that all Muslims would be stereotyped and scapegoated, and this heightened sensitivity lingers. It partly explains what just happened at Brandeis University. The school had invited Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a celebrated advocate for Muslim women, to receive an honorary degree. But when some professors and students complained, citing statements of hers that seemed broadly derisive of Islam, the invitation was withdrawn. Clearly, university officials didn’t want their campus seen as a cradle or theater of Islamophobia.

But other college campuses in recent years have been theaters of anti-Israel discussions that occasionally veer toward, or bleed into, condemnations of Jews. And while we don’t have the anti-Semitism in our politics that some European countries do, there’s still bigotry under the surface. There are still caricatures that won’t die.

One of them flared last month on the Christian televangelist Pat Robertson’s TV show. His guest was a rabbi who, shockingly, was himself trafficking in the notion that Jews excel at making money. The rabbi said that a Jew wouldn’t squander a weekend tinkering with his car when he could hire a mechanic and concentrate on something else.

“It’s polishing diamonds, not fixing cars,” Robertson interjected.

Polishing diamonds?

In a 2013 survey of 1,200 American adults for the Anti-Defamation League, 14 percent agreed with the statement that “Jews have too much power” in our country, while 15 percent said Jews are “more willing to use shady practices” and 30 percent said that American Jews are “more loyal to Israel” than to the United States.

That’s disturbing, as is the way in which the Holocaust is minimized by its repeated invocation as an analogy. In separate comments this year, both the venture capitalist Tom Perkins and Kenneth Langone, one of the founders of Home Depot, said that the superrich in America were being vilified the way Jews in Nazi Germany had been.

It’s not just Kansas and the heartland where anti-Semitism, sometimes called the oldest hatred, stays young.

A scheduled court appearance for Mr. Miller, who also goes by Frazier Glenn Cross, was postponed, leaving unanswered for another day the question of why. But Mr. Miller’s true nature has never been in doubt.

His rudimentary website, for example, includes photographs of Ku Klux Klan rallies, a position paper on the need to do “whatever is necessary” to break the Jewish control of the media and a link to his interview with the radio personality Howard Stern in 2010. After recommending that people get “Jew-wise,” Mr. Miller encourages visitors to have a nice day.

He joined the Army as a teenager in March 1959. According to Mr. Miller and the Southern Poverty Law Center, he served two tours in Vietnam and for 13 years was a Green Beret. But he found his calling, he later said, when his father gave him a copy of a racist, anti-Semitic newsletter called “The Thunderbolt.”

For a while, Mr. Miller — with his distinctive thick, dark mustache — was near or at the center of white supremacist action. He was present as a member of a Nazi group called the National Socialist Party of America when white supremacists shot and killed five communists at an anti-Klan protest march in Greensboro, N.C., in 1979.

According to the law center, Mr. Miller received death threats, his wife moved with their children to Chicago, and the Army forced him to retire, all because of his racism. His commitment only intensified.

He moved to a farm that his father gave him in Angier, N.C., and formed the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, modeling his style of leadership on Hitler’s. He preferred military-style fatigues to the Klan’s white robes, and led his minions in boot camp-style drills and many public rallies.

Michael L. Williams, the Texas commissioner of education, who investigated Mr. Miller as a federal prosecutor in the 1980s, recalled him as a gifted recruiter who could proselytize at rallies or in a grocery store parking lot.

“He knew enough of the law, enough of American history, enough of the thinking of the founders that he could craft this bastardized notion of liberty and this notion of states’ authority and states’ rights,” Mr. Williams said.

The law center secured a consent decree that prevented the Carolina Knights from continuing their racist paramilitary pursuits. But Mr. Miller was soon convicted of violating the consent decree, and while awaiting an appeal, he vanished, while continuing to encourage followers to kill blacks, Jews, judges and Morris Dees, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s co-founder and chief trial counsel.

William E. Martin, a North Carolina lawyer who, as a federal public defender, represented Mr. Miller in the 1980s, described his former client as a “very personable” man of typical habits, save for his worldview.

“In standard conversation, he would be very much a regular guy,” Mr. Martin said. “But if you at all got him speaking about politics, you would immediately get his point of view on whatever topic you may be discussing, and he would be quite open about it.”

Federal agents eventually tear-gassed Mr. Miller out of a weapons- and ammunition-crammed mobile home in the Ozarks. He pleaded guilty to a weapons charge, served three years in federal prison and as part of his plea deal later testified against other white supremacist leaders.

Many white supremacists ostracized him as a result. But Ms. Beirich said that others considered him a hero. “There are people who will say, ‘This guy’s the real deal, as opposed to you guys who spend all your time on the Internet,’ ” she said.

About a decade ago, Mr. Miller moved to Aurora, Mo., where he has lived with his current wife, Marge, in a gray, ranch-style house at the junction of two farm roads. It is from there that he has enjoyed a second act, promoting his views on Internet hate forums, especially the Vanguard News Network website.

Locally, he is known as an affable man, pretty much like anyone else, except for his views that Jews deserve extermination, and that the white race is, as he has written, “drowning literally in seas of colored mongrels.” He has mostly kept to himself, except when handing out white-supremacist literature.

Judy Dingman, the business manager and news editor of The Aurora Advertiser, said that the weekly newspaper stopped running Mr. Miller’s letters years ago. And Sheriff Brad DeLay of Lawrence County said that while local law-enforcement officials knew of Mr. Miller’s criminal past, he was pleasant enough, one on one.

“Eventually he would start to talk about his beliefs, and you knew where he stood,” Sheriff DeLay said. “But he was never aggressive about it. He would tell you what he thought without remorse.”

Mr. Miller has occasionally run for office — more, it seems, to spread his white supremacist beliefs than to join government — but has never been elected. He usually collected only a handful of votes.

Rufus L. Edmisten, who was the Democratic candidate for governor in North Carolina in 1984, remembered Mr. Miller appearing at political forums as a fringe candidate. “We all knew that he was a nut, and I don’t mind saying that,” Mr. Edmisten said. “He can sue me if he wants to.”

In recent years, Mr. Miller has also been a devoted pen pal to incarcerated white supremacists, among them Joseph Paul Franklin, a convicted murderer who was executed in Missouri in November. Ms. Beirich, of the law center, said that Mr. Miller was very close to Mr. Franklin, whose birthday was Sunday, the day of the shooting.

On the day before, around three o’clock in the afternoon, Mr. Miller left Aurora in his white sedan, bound for another visit to a Missouri casino, according to Ms. Beirich, who has spoken with Mr. Miller’s wife.

Around 10:30 on Sunday morning, Ms. Beirich said, Mr. Miller called his wife to say that he was winning, and that all was well. The convicted felon had at least a shotgun and a handgun, the authorities say.

The episode, which police described as a bias attack, occurred just after midnight on Sunday as the couple waited at the West Fourth Street station near Washington Square. The suspect approached the two men and asked if they were gay.

The couple ignored the suspect, who continued to make derogatory statements about gay people. He then punched one of the men, knocking him to the platform, the police said. The suspect then ran off.

The altercation lasted only a few moments, the police said.

The victim, identified as a 39-year-old man from Clifton, N.J., suffered a broken nose, a fractured orbital bone and a cut above the eye that required stitches, the police said. He was treated at Lenox Hill Hospital and then released. His partner was not injured. The police released a sketch of the suspect on Thursday, based on the description by the victim and his partner.

Last year, the city grappled with an increase in the number of antigay attacks, including the shooting death of Mark Carson, 32, in May in Greenwich Village by a man who prosecutors say taunted him with homophobic slurs.

The Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, announced the plea deal. A spokesman for him, Steven Reed, said it had been offered to Mr. Mendez “after lengthy consultation with the victims.” He said the victims “wanted to find a way which adequately punished the individuals responsible and also avoid having to testify at trial.”

But some gay rights advocates said they were disappointed that Mr. Mendez and the other men would not have to fully answer for their crime.

“We are pleased that the perpetrators of this egregious crime are being punished for their uncivil actions,” said Peter C. Frank, a co-founder and secretary of the newly formed Bronx L.G.B.T.Q.

“I take full responsibility for everything that happened and that’s why I’m pleading guilty,” said Mr. Mendez, who sported braids and a large tattoo of a profanity on his arm. Still, he also insisted that he was high on drugs when the police questioned him, and that “many of the statements attributed to me in this case” were not true.

Acting Justice Steven L. Barrett, in explaining the implications of the plea, informed Mr. Mendez that because of his prior conviction for attempted criminal possession of a weapon, he would be jailed for life if convicted of another violent felony.

Mr. Mendez is expected to be formally sentenced on March 31. Under the plea deal, he will serve five years of probation after his release from prison.

To many Muslims and non-Muslims, that is a worrying trend in what is considered to be a generally tolerant country as it heads toward the 2015 general election. A divided Conservative Party has a populist, anti-immigration party to its right in the U.K. Independence Party, and even the opposition Labour Party is supporting restrictions on benefits for immigrants.

He mentioned the firebombing of a nearby mosque after the Rigby killing, as well as the fatal stabbing in April of Mohammed Saleem, 82, as he left a local mosque. His attacker was a recent Ukrainian immigrant, who also placed three small bombs outside mosques. In June, a police officer and three other people were stabbed outside another Birmingham mosque.

It is not clear how the current tensions will affect what some analysts say has been a slow but gradual trend of greater racial understanding in Britain, though periodically interrupted by racial and ethnic eruptions of hostility. News media attention to immigration from within the European Union has also helped dilute the focus on Muslims.

“Islamophobia intensifies after big events like 9/11, 7/7 and the Lee Rigby murder, and anti-Muslim hate crimes spike,” said Humayun Ansari, a professor of Islamic history at Royal Holloway, University of London, referring to the July 7, 2005, bomb attacks in London. “Then it actually fades away and dies down to a much lower level of intensity.”

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/opinion/fairer-policing-in-suffolk-county.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Five years after the killing of Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant, fueled an outcry in Suffolk County, N.Y., the Justice Department and the county police department have reached a tentative agreement to settle an investigation of discriminatory policing in immigrant communities there.

Mr. Lucero was stabbed by teenagers who had made a sport of hunting and harassing Latino men in the waterfront village of Patchogue. The attack exposed not just a frightening strain of anti-immigrant violence in a seemingly placid part of suburban Long Island but also an appalling pattern of inaction and ineptitude by the county police. Mr. Lucero’s death spurred immigrants to come forward to say that officers regularly brushed off reports of harassment and abuse and discouraged them from filing complaints. An investigation by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division found that officers had routinely misclassified likely bias attacks as mere “youth disturbances,” fostering a climate in which hate crimes went unreported. Though several other Latinos had told the police of being assaulted by the very men who killed Mr. Lucero, nothing was ever done until after that fatal attack.

The agreement announced last Tuesday calls for new policies on training, accountability and outreach to Latinos. The County Legislature should approve the agreement, to get Suffolk moving beyond the dismal place it was five years ago when the county executive at the time, Steve Levy, was a national anti-immigrant firebrand, stoking resentment and fear, and Suffolk was notorious for its immigrant-hostile politics and abusive immigration raids.

There have been exemplary efforts at community reconciliation since the Lucero killing by people like the mayor of Patchogue, Paul Pontieri, who has resolutely built bridges between Latino and Anglo neighbors. But it took a federal civil-rights investigation to prod the police department to change its ways. It will take close scrutiny by the community, immigrants, advocates and residents to make sure these reforms stick.",nytimes.com,True

During the altercation, prosecutors said, Mr. Marajh said to the victim, “I’ll knock you out.”

Mr. Marajh was in court on Saturday evening for an arraignment hearing on misdemeanor assault and harassment charges. He was released on $750 bail.

Mr. Marajh had been celebrating his birthday with friends when he passed the victim, his lawyer, James Kirshner, said. Mr. Marajh, who denied hitting him, had never heard of the Knockout Game, Mr. Kirshner said, adding, “This case has blown out of proportion.”

Dread about being singled out for attacks has taken root in Jewish communities in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Crown Heights, Borough Park and Midwood, according to Dov Hikind, a state assemblyman.

Two weeks ago, a 78-year-old woman in Brooklyn reported being punched in the head, with her assailant fleeing without touching her shopping bags or her pocketbook.

This followed sporadic reports of similar recent attacks in Crown Heights, Mr. Hikind said, including one on a 19-year-old Hasidic man who said he had been approached by eight men and then punched in the face by one of them, in what the police said was a possible hate crime.

Then, at 2:45 a.m. on Friday, on the border of Borough Park, a 24-year-old man found himself suddenly boxed in by three men and punched by a fourth. Police said the four men had been out celebrating and were “somewhat intoxicated.” Mr. Kelly said the victim overheard the group discussing “how you knock somebody out.” (Amrit Marajh, 28, of Brooklyn, was charged with assault and with aggravated harassment as a hate crime.)

Whatever the case, a type of panic set in. Mr. Hikind said a girls’ high school in Midwood canceled a Friday evening get-together after nervous parents called the school, expressing concern for their daughters’ safety.

“It’s sick, it’s scary,” said Mr. Hikind, who gathered with other Jewish community leaders last week to discuss the attacks. “It’s like nothing I’ve experienced in my 31 years in office.”

But police officials cautioned that they had yet to see evidence of an organized game spreading among teenagers online, though they have been reluctant to rule out the possibility.

There is particular concern within the department that widespread coverage could create the atmosphere where such a “game” could take hold in New York.

Much news coverage of reported knockout attacks includes 2012 footage from a surveillance camera in Pittsburgh of James Addlespurger, a high school teacher who was 50, being swiftly struck to the ground by a young man walking down an alleyway with some friends. Yet the Pittsburgh police said the attacker insisted the assault was not part of any organized “game.”

“This was just a random act of violence,” Police Commander Eric Holmes said in a televised interview last year. “He stated that he was just having a bad day that day.” The assailant saw Mr. Addlespurger, the commander said, “and decided this was a course of action he was going to take.”

Telecasts have also shown teenagers in Jersey City, their faces blurred, describing knockouts, which they defined as anyone might; someone is struck and knocked out. But they did not report that it was a game.

Bob McHugh, a police spokesman in Jersey City, said there had not been a single reported knockout incident there.

“If there ever was an urban myth, this was it,” he said. Still community concerns spurred by the video prompted a member of the City Council there, Candice Osborne, to post on her Facebook page, “there have been NO reported instances of this type of assault.”

In nearby Hoboken, there was one report of a random assault; in September a man approached by three youths was punched, and died after his head became wedged in a fence between pickets.

Prosecutors would not say whether the fourth suspended student, a minor, would also face charges.

Campus officials learned of the incidents in mid-October, after the black student’s parents visited and reported seeing a racial slur on a dry-erase board in the suite. When questioned, the student, who was 17, told the university police and other officials about several other incidents.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/us/joseph-paul-franklin-executed-in-missouri.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Joseph P. Franklin, a white supremacist who killed at least eight people in a shooting spree from 1977 to 1980 and confessed to being the sniper who wounded the Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt and the lawyer and civil rights activist Vernon E. Jordan Jr., was executed on Wednesday, the Missouri Department of Public Safety said.

His death, by lethal injection, came after his scheduled execution had been delayed twice by last-minute stays because of concerns about the state’s new drug protocol and Mr. Franklin’s mental competency. He was injected at 6:07 a.m. and declared dead 10 minutes later, officials said.

Mr. Franklin, 63, was convicted of nine murders but considered a suspect in a dozen more. He received the death sentence in 1997 for the murder of Gerald Gordon, one of three people hit by long-range rifle fire on Oct. 8, 1977, outside a suburban St. Louis synagogue. Mr. Franklin confessed to the crime 17 years later from a prison cell, where he was serving four life sentences in connection with six other killings, all described as hate crimes.

He told investigators that he had picked the synagogue at random, intending to kill only Jews.

Mr. Franklin was one of a dozen death row inmates who have challenged the constitutionality of Missouri’s method of lethal injection. The state changed its drug formula protocols in October after several pharmaceutical companies in the United States and Europe began refusing to provide drugs used in executions.

The state turned to an unnamed compounding pharmacy for help in producing a new solution. The practice is controversial because drugs mixed in compounding pharmacies are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and critics say their use could cause needless suffering and botched executions.

Federal prosecutors had charged Mr. Franklin in the attempted murder of Mr. Jordan in 1980 but failed to win a conviction. In a 1996 interview with a TV reporter, Mr. Franklin admitted to having shot him.",nytimes.com,True

A young, white man, well educated and seemingly well integrated into society, acting on his own, Mr. Lapshyn fits a profile that has British counterterrorism investigators increasingly worried.

“They are lone actors but often more proficient than actors who we may see at the other end of the terrorist spectrum,” Charles Farr, the director general of the Office for Security and Counterterrorism, was quoted as saying in The Times of London.

Lone wolves driven by an indiscriminate hatred of immigrants and in particular of Muslims can manage to stay under the radar more easily than members of militant cells can, investigators say.

The tracking of far-right extremists intensified in Britain in 2010 after the police arrested one man who had more than 30 guns and about 50 explosive devices in his house, and another who ran a white-supremacist Web site and made the poison ricin. When a Norwegian man, Anders Behring Breivik, killed 77 people in Norway in 2011, surveillance of the far right was stepped up again.

He put his first bomb into a children’s lunchbox, took it on a bus — a moment recorded on security video — and left it outside a mosque in Walsall, an industrial town northwest of Birmingham. The bomb went off but did not hurt anyone. A week later he tried again in Wolverhampton, west of Walsall, and once again the device detonated without harming anyone.

His third attempt, on July 12, accelerated the investigation by the police and eventually led to his arrest. This time, Mr. Lapshyn built a much more deadly device, packed with more than a pound of nails, and planted it at a mosque in Tipton, about halfway between Birmingham and Wolverhampton.

Its timer was set for 1 p.m., when the mosque would normally be crowded with worshipers, but the start time for Friday Prayer happened to be an hour later than usual that week.

When the bomb detonated, it sent the nails shooting as high as 230 feet; some were found afterward deeply embedded in trees.

As you reported, on the evening of Sept. 21, Prabhjot Singh was brutally beaten amid jeers of “Osama” and “terrorist.” Dr. Singh, a Sikh who is profoundly committed to improving the health of poor and underserved communities locally and globally, was honored last year by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with its inaugural Young Leader Award, given to 10 people aged 40 and under for exceptional contributions to improving the health of the nation.

I am writing on behalf of his co-honorees, who were appalled to hear that our friend and colleague was the victim of this unconscionable act of violence, but inspired and humbled by his resolve in maintaining the Sikh tradition of disciplined optimism.

But the assailants were on bicycles, the police said, and easily caught him and his companion, a fellow Sikh who Dr. Singh said asked not to be identified.

The assault ended when pedestrians intervened.

A man shouted at the young men to leave him alone, Dr. Singh said, and a nurse who lived across the street came to his aid.

He was most recently arrested on Aug. 13, for trying to strike a woman in Harlem and then spitting in her face, the police said. He was recently living in supported housing, a type of residence where people with mental illness can receive special services but are typically free to come and go.

Mr. Redrick, who is being held at Rikers Island in $1 million bail, was taken to State Supreme Court in Manhattan for a brief appearance on Tuesday. He wore a tan shirt, with plaid patches across his broad shoulders.

He was clearly agitated, and immediately began insisting that his new court-appointed lawyer, Michael J. Croce, hand him a business card. After repeatedly trying to interrupt as Mr. Croce spoke to the judge, Mr. Redrick grew louder and more insistent.

“Excuse me, I don’t want you to represent me if you don’t give me your business card right now,” Mr. Redrick said.

Chess players at Union Square Park were still shaken by the attack. Several described Mr. Redrick as a loner with some strange habits, but one who attracted little attention in a park where the offbeat is commonplace. Frederick Spruill, 69, said he first noticed Mr. Redrick playing chess this summer and thought he appeared to have “some kind of mental challenge.”

“He was very quiet,” Mr. Spruill said. “He would become stuck on something. If he saw something, he’d stay on it.”

Michael Benson, 54, said Mr. Redrick occasionally hinted at a violent past. “I ever tell you the time I knocked this guy out?” Mr. Benson recalled Mr. Redrick telling him.

On Wednesday, the two played several games and Mr. Redrick lost all of them, but did not seem angry about the losses, Mr. Benson said. Mr. Redrick stood up, walked over to the steps next to the busy subway entrance, and smoked a cigarette. Mr. Benson said he heard Mr. Redrick yell that he was tired of white commuters bumping into him and not saying “excuse me.”

“The next white person who runs into me, I’m going to knock them out,” Mr. Redrick said, according to Mr. Benson.

Mr. Babbitt was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where, the police said, he was eventually declared brain dead and died on Monday morning.

In a neighborhood that had long ago moved past its rough-and-tumble days, the seemingly random act of violence at 3 p.m. in a bustling park came as a shock. The police said that Mr. Marten, 40, had a long history of arrests, some for assault and drug offenses in New York City and in Newburgh, N.Y.

He was arrested shortly after the attack and charged with three counts of assault. With Mr. Babbitt’s death, those charges will most likely be upgraded by a grand jury that is to hear the case on Tuesday, according to the police.

Mr. Marten, who is black, has also gone by the alias Martin Redrick and listed a different birth date, the police said.

On Monday evening, many residents at Mr. Babbitt’s modest brick apartment building on Ocean Avenue in Sheepshead Bay had something nice to say about him, and could only shake their heads at the senselessness of his death.

Ms. Feifer said Mr. Babbitt, who she said moved to the neighborhood from Florida about 20 years ago, used to insist on giving her rides to bus stops or to buy doughnuts.

Inside the apartment that Mr. Babbitt shared with his mother, Ms. Feifer said, he kept model steam locomotives, stacks of magazines about trains, and many comic books. He often wore shirts showing pictures of fairies and once drove Ms. Feifer out of state to join him at a Fairy-Con gathering, a festival for people who celebrate fairies.

Mr. Babbitt’s mother was at his bedside at least part of the time he was in the hospital, said Mr. Ayers, who visited him there. Many neighbors wonder who will care for her now.

Mr. Babbitt’s death came as the police said they were looking for a suspect in another bizarre and possibly racially motivated attack on the M60 bus in Harlem on Friday, Aug. 30.

In that unrelated attack, a man hurled a racial epithet at a 31-year-old Queens man, calling him a “cracker,” before knocking him to the ground and punching him. The victim, whose name was not released, sustained a broken nose and a fractured eye socket. The suspect, described by the police as a black man in his late 30s, fled on foot and had not been located.

At Forbidden Planet, employees were left bereft by Mr. Babbitt’s death, said Mr. Ayers, who broke into tears several times during a short interview.

Mr. Ayers had spoken to Mr. Babbitt the day before the attack when he came to the store looking to pick up a copy of a comic art book called “The Art of Grimm Fairy Tales” that he had ordered. The order had not yet arrived, and Mr. Babbitt was slightly annoyed, Mr. Ayers said.

“He’s been hounding me for weeks and weeks for this book,” he said.

Mr. Ayers said employees were also concerned about Mr. Babbitt’s mother. He said they planned to set up a fund to help continue her care.

“What is going on now in Russia contradicts its place in the world,” said Anton Krasovsky, a television anchor who was immediately fired from his job at the government-controlled KontrTV network in January after he announced during a live broadcast that he is gay, saying he was fed up with lying about his life and offended by the legislation.

Few gay people in Russia openly acknowledge their sexual orientation, and those who do are often harassed. When some gay people protested the propaganda law by kissing outside the State Duma, the lower house of Parliament, police officers stood by and watched as the demonstrators were doused with water and beaten by antigay and religious supporters of the bill.

An overwhelming 88 percent of Russians support the gay propaganda ban, according to a survey conducted in June by the All-Russian Public Opinion Center. A survey conducted in April by the Levada Center found that 35 percent of Russians believed that homosexuality was a disease and 43 percent believed that it was a bad habit, a result of poor parenting or a lack of discipline, or a symptom of abuse.

Last month, Patriarch Kirill I, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, called same-sex marriage “a very dangerous sign of the apocalypse.”

Mixed signals from senior Russian officials over how the propaganda law might be enforced during the Games have undercut assertions by the International Olympic Committee that gay athletes and spectators have nothing to worry about, and have left organizing officials facing harsh criticism and demanding clarifications from the Kremlin.

There have been comparisons to Nazi Germany as host of the 1936 Olympics inside and outside Russia, including one by Jay Leno during an interview with President Obama last week on “The Tonight Show.”

“Something that shocked me about Russia,” Mr. Leno told the president. “Suddenly, homosexuality is against the law. I mean, this seems like Germany: Let’s round up the Jews. Let’s round up the gays. Let’s round up the blacks. I mean, it starts with that.”

Mr. Obama, on Mr. Leno’s show and again at a White House news conference on Friday, noted that Russia was not alone in its treatment of gay people, but he denounced the legislation and said he expected Mr. Putin and the Russian government to prevent any discrimination in Sochi.

“I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them,” he told Mr. Leno. At the White House, Mr. Obama said he opposed a boycott of the Games, but added, “Nobody is more offended than me by some of the antigay and lesbian legislation that you’ve been seeing in Russia.”

Russian officials say the criticism is unfair and inaccurate. In 1993, Russia repealed the Soviet-era law that made gay sex a crime.

“This is not about imposing any kind of sanctions against homosexuality,” Mr. Putin said, defending the propaganda law at a news conference in June. “This is about protecting children.”

Gay rights advocates disagree, saying the law is vague and can be used to arrest anyone who appears to support gay rights.

American rights groups, backed by athletes like Blake Skjellerup, a speed skater, and Greg Louganis, the gold medalist diver, are leading efforts to pressure Russia and the International Olympic Committee, including the vodka boycott and a petition signed by more than 300,000 people.

Critics say Russia’s repression of gay rights is part of a pattern that also includes a tightening of pressure on civil society groups, and steps to limit foreign influences — all seemingly out of sync with Russia’s push to host international events, like the recently completed 2013 World University Games in Kazan and the international track and field championships now under way in Moscow.

Beyond Sochi, Russia will hold the World Cup in 2018 and is bidding for the World Expo in 2020.

Russian gay rights advocates said the outrage in the West was providing new energy and financial support to their still relatively young movement. It is also raising pressure, including fears of increased violence.

“It’s not only a question of the period of the Olympic Games; here, there should be no law like this,” said Kirill Kalugin, 21, who was beaten by counterdemonstrators at a gay pride event in St. Petersburg last month and then detained by the police. “I feel very offended that I am being presented as an enemy of my own people.”

Mr. Krasovsky, the fired television anchor, likened life for gay people in Russia to that in the rural America in 1989, seven years before the Defense of Marriage Act became law.

Aleksandr Smirnov, 39, a freelance journalist, said he was forced to quit his job in the press office of a deputy mayor in Moscow after he was featured with more than two dozen other gay Muscovites in a special issue of Afisha magazine in February. Being gay in Russia means “you are under permanent stress,” he said.

As for gay propaganda, he said the notion was ridiculous.

“Seven years ago, I wrote a letter to my mother, explaining my position, and I tried to explain to her that this has nothing to do with the existing stereotypes,” Mr. Smirnov said. “I told her that when I was about 13, I just felt, that, you know, I like boys, just the way the boys, not gays, at this same age, started to have feelings toward girls and women. I was not seduced. I was not lured into it, provoked into it. This happened quite naturally.”

Rights advocates said that Russia was growing more dangerous for gay people. This year, there have been at least two killings motivated by antigay bias in the country, including the savage beating death in May of a young man in Volgograd who was also sodomized with beer bottles.

Mr. Smirnov said that even in Moscow and in St. Petersburg, where there are large gay populations, as well as a thriving and visible gay night life that includes several gay bars and clubs, bias was inescapable.

“If you ask gays in Moscow whether they were attacked, or insulted, practically everyone will admit that it happened to him,” he said. “We are just at the very, very beginning of the movement for the rights of gays.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/opinion/an-attack-on-equality.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"An Attack on Equality: In New York, widely regarded as a gay-friendly city, reports of attacks on same-sex couples are on the rise. Here, one young couple tells their story.

New York is regarded as a gay-friendly city in a state that has legalized gay marriage, but this Op-Doc video shows that it can still be dangerous for a same-sex couple to walk down the street holding hands.

On May 5, 2013, a young couple was attacked outside Madison Square Garden in broad daylight. Nick Porto and Kevin Atkins were walking hand in hand when a group of several men, clad in Knicks jerseys, called them “faggots” and pushed them to the ground, beating them to the point of a torn ligament and a broken nose. In this video, Mr. Porto and Mr. Atkins tell their story.

They illustrate a sad statistic. According to the New York Police Department, there were already 29 reported antigay hate crimes in New York City by late May, an increase of 70 percent compared with the same period in 2012 (even as hate crimes over all went down nearly 30 percent). The real number may be higher, as many attacks are not reported.

During the production of this video, our whole team witnessed the very intolerance that this story comments on. On a sweltering summer afternoon, when we filmed Mr. Porto and Mr. Atkins kissing outside Madison Square Garden, several passers-by gave the couple obvious looks of disgust. One man, sitting on steps behind the couple, called them “faggots,” adding an expletive, as he took cellphone photos of our shoot. Yet there were also many others who walked by without a second glance, and one who even told us he appreciated what we were doing.

This story is a potent reminder not to take for granted New York’s reputation as a safe haven of tolerance and acceptance. Despite notable national progress on issues like gay marriage, true equality for many is a long way off.

“Without Barnoar, it would have happened much slower and not at the same volume,” said Gal Uchovsky, a longtime and outspoken L.G.B.T. activist. “Barnoar amplified everything.”

In the succeeding years, as investigators came up empty on clues, the public had its own theories as to the culprits. “People pointed to the orthodox community, to the people who always gay-bash,” said Mr. Uchovsky, referring to Israel’s ultrareligious Jewish population, a member of which stabbed a marcher at the 2005 Jerusalem Pride Parade.

But in June, as rainbow flags flapped around the city for the annual Pride festivities, the police stunned the community when they announced that the Barnoar killers had been caught, and the investigators were no longer calling it a hate crime but rather an act of personal revenge.

The following weeks played out like a Hollywood script: two suspects turned state’s witnesses, and one of them escaped and was on the loose for almost three days before being caught. Ultimately, on July 8, only the 23-year-old gunman was indicted on two counts of first-degree murder and 10 counts of attempted murder, “motivated by feelings of revenge and anger” and “hostility toward the victim’s sexual orientation,” according to the indictment.

“The news was confusing, is still confusing” Ms. Nir said.

Mr. Uchovsky said, “It’s very embarrassing.”

Since the shooting, much of the country seemed to be sharing in the gay community’s blossoming pride. But now many gay men and lesbians are on the defensive, struggling to address the sordid allegations, while some right-wing politicians accuse the community of crying wolf. Most gay men and lesbians, speaking in the news media or on social networks, are still adamant that the crime was driven by deep homophobia and deserves the distinction of a hate crime, an argument the indictment appears to accept.

But not everyone agrees.

“People don’t question whether it was a hate crime,” said Alon Shani, a reporter for Israeli television who covered the case when it occurred and who also identifies with the L.G.B.T. community. He thinks gay leaders have clung to the narrative of a hate crime for so long that they don’t dare let go. But with hate crimes, he points out, motives matter. And until the case is argued in court and a verdict is handed down, there’s simply no way to know for sure.

As uncomfortable as it is to say, there is a certain “loss in terms of P.R. value” when what seemed like a clear-cut hate crime narrative turns out to be marred, said Shuki Cohen, an assistant professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Dr. Cohen, born in Israel, counts himself as a member of the L.G.B.T. community as well. For many minorities, he said, “our suffering is our identity card.”

Mr. Uchovsky admits: “It’s not so good when you have to hang onto a massacre. Same way I don’t think we have to cling to the Holocaust to explain why Israel should exist.”

A massacre may be extreme, but a symbol can also evolve from any event that unearths, or at least appears to unearth, social injustices. Two high-profile cases in the United States reignited national debates on race, gender and socioeconomic status: the 1987 Tawana Brawley case, in which a black teenager from New York claimed that she had been abducted and raped by a gang of white men, prompting a racially charged controversy that played out for more than a year, and the 2006 Duke lacrosse scandal, when accusations of rape and assault against three student-athletes became part of a national debate about violence against women by cosseted athletes.

Ultimately, however, investigators in both cases found evidence to dispel the original accusations, so, as social symbols, they collapsed.

Barnoar isn’t so simple: crimes were indeed committed, young adults were killed and there really was a wolf to cry wolf about.

Aug. 1 will be the four-year anniversary of the Barnoar killings. It is expected to be a much quieter event this year, not only because the case has essentially been solved, but also because it’s not clear what it stands for anymore.

Many in the Israeli L.G.B.T. community insist that, despite the revelations, the event is important to their collective history and must be commemorated. Far from rejecting the new evidence before them, many in the community agree that they must now look inward.

Ms. Nir suggested that, as a symbol, Barnoar can be both a hate crime and a warning sign. “The subject puts the spotlight on the dark side of the community,” she said. “It’s a red light for us.”

But turning a tragedy into a symbol is ultimately an act of healing as well, and there appear to be no plans by the community to wash its hands of the matter completely, no matter how unsavory the new narrative has become.

The department sets a high bar for such a prosecution. Three former Justice Department officials who once worked in the department’s Civil Rights Division, which is handling the inquiry, said Sunday that the federal government must clear a series of difficult legal hurdles before it could move to indict Mr. Zimmerman.

“It is not enough if it’s just a fight that escalated,” said Samuel Bagenstos, who until 2011 served as the principal deputy assistant attorney general in the division. “The government has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant acted willfully with a seriously culpable state of mind” to violate Mr. Martin’s civil rights.

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. hinted at those challenges last year.

“We have to prove the highest standard in the law,” Mr. Holder said at a news conference in April 2012. “Something that was reckless, that was negligent, does not meet that standard. We have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with the requisite state of mind.”

Criminal charges under federal hate crime law have increased significantly during the Obama administration. Between 2009 and 2012, the Justice Department prosecuted 29 percent more such cases than in the previous three fiscal years. Last month in Seattle, for example, Jamie Larson, 49, pleaded guilty to federal hate crime charges that he beat a cabdriver, who was from India and was wearing a turban.

The increase is in part because of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, enacted in 2009, which removed a requirement that a victim had to be engaged in a federally protected activity, like voting or going to school.

But the Obama administration’s Justice Department has been cautious in its use of the expanded law. In 2010, for example, it turned down calls by civil rights leaders to file charges in New York City in the 2006 death of Sean Bell, a 23-year-old black man who was fatally shot by police officers outside a Queens club just hours before he was to be married.

Mr. Morales, 33, appeared in court wearing a white T-shirt. He had a tattoo on his neck: “Meladie,” next to musical notes. He pleaded not guilty and was returned to jail, where he had been held without bail since his arrest. Mr. Morales served 11 years in state prison on a robbery conviction before he was released in 2010.

The police said that Mr. Morales, walking the neighborhood with two acquaintances, had urinated in front of a restaurant and then gone inside and confronted the bartender with antigay slurs. He yanked up his sweatshirt to reveal a revolver in a shoulder holster and threatened to kill the bartender if he called 911.

The three men left and encountered Mr. Carson at West Eighth Street. Again Mr. Morales unleashed antigay slurs and pursued Mr. Carson and a male friend as they tried to walk away, according to the police.

Soon after, a police officer spotted Mr. Morales on West Third Street and ordered him to stop. Mr. Morales pointed the revolver at the officer, who was able to tackle Mr. Morales as he fumbled with the weapon, according to Mr. Vance’s office.

The court records say most of Mr. Morales’s statements to the police were videotaped. He expressed only one concern — that he may have shot a police officer — and explained his propensity to break his mother’s heart, according to the records.

“This is gonna kill my mom,” he said at a police station house. “I always hurt her and make bad decisions in life and make her cry.”

By the next morning, his boasts had turned to claims that he did not remember what had happened before he “woke up with cops on me.” He said he was homeless and that sadness in his family life led him to drink.

They remembered him variously as a hard worker and a party lover who was open about his sexuality from an early age, serious about his job as assistant manager of the Ciao Bella gelato kiosk in Grand Central Terminal and close to his family. Some said he was a Jehovah’s Witness, aware that his sexuality was in conflict with his religious beliefs.

His mother, Jacqueline Bumpars, lives in the St. Nicholas Houses, a few blocks north of the funeral home, where Malcolm X’s body was displayed after his murder in 1965. Mr. Carson had lived with her on and off before moving with a friend to Brooklyn last year. Relatives declined to talk to reporters before or after the service.

In a hall decorated with portraits of religious figures and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., people from his family, work, church and social circles heard a scriptural exegesis with almost no mention of Mr. Carson’s life or the circumstances of his death until, toward the end, Kirk Barrow, the funeral director, told the crowd, “The person who committed this heinous act against Mark, they will be no more.”

Some details of his life emerged. According to the program, Mr. Carson graduated from Legacy High School and attended the Borough of Manhattan Community College. He gave himself the nickname Envy for the way he entered a room, convinced that everyone envied him, said Chris Sandford, 26, who said he and Mr. Carson discussed dating but never quite got there.

Mr. Carson, she said, was mostly discreet about his romantic life. “He’d go on little dates,” Ms. Martin said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “He was very private about that.”

His family accepted his sexuality, said Karen Grant, who knew Mr. Carson’s mother since they were both pregnant together. “Your family is your family,” Ms. Grant said. “They all loved him.”

That ended in the early morning hours of May 18, when the police say a 33-year-old man, Elliot Morales, taunted Mr. Carson and shot him once in the cheek. Mr. Morales has been charged with murder in the second degree as a hate crime, among other charges.

Mr. Carson did not let his night life interfere with his work at Ciao Bella, even when he had to open the shop at 8 a.m., said Santiago Morocho, 40, a fellow assistant manager. “He worked here for seven years, so you know he had to be good,” Mr. Morocho said.

The kiosk closed on Wednesday morning so the staff could attend the funeral.

One friend, Jonathan Smith, said Mr. Carson had been trying to change his life in the last year. Mr. Smith, 25, said they studied the Bible together and visited the Jehovah’s Witnesses headquarters in Brooklyn Heights. “He made a lot of changes in his life to make God happy,” Mr. Smith said, adding that Mr. Carson had detached himself from many old friends.

Several friends said they were not aware of any religious turn, but Mr. Barrow, the funeral director, repeated during the service, “This is what Mark believed.”

Detectives canvassed for what witnesses they could still find. Mr. Rispoli died four days later.

In this neighborhood of low crime and park benches filled with conversation, the killing of Mr. Rispoli last year raised troubling questions of how the police responded in the first minutes after the Oct. 20 attack.

Seven months later, those questions remain largely unanswered and the killing, unsolved.

“What happened that night?” said Jimmy Van Bramer, a friend of Mr. Rispoli’s and the local City Council member. “Why didn’t the evidence collection unit show up?”

While motive in the killing was not known, the beating death of Mr. Rispoli — an openly gay man walking on the street — found disturbing new resonance after the deadly shooting last week of a gay man in the West Village and a citywide increase in hate crimes against gay people this year.

The deadly attack on Mr. Rispoli set off two separate and still continuing Police Department investigations: one by detectives into the crime, and a second by the Internal Affairs Bureau into why officers initially determined no crime had taken place.

According to a person familiar with the investigation, that determination was made by the responding supervisor on the midnight shift who told patrol officers that the man, Mr. Rispoli, had been the victim not of an assault, but of a drunken fall. It was not clear, the person said, what led the supervisor to that conclusion, or how the victim’s wounds appeared to officers.

A police summary of the crime days later said that officers had found Mr. Rispoli unconscious; more recently, the police said he had been awake and vomiting, but unable to communicate.

A witness, who called 911 and remained at the scene, said officers there never questioned him. “They didn’t talk to nobody that night,” said the witness, a 55-year-old Sunnyside resident who requested anonymity because the killers remained at large.

About two hours before the attack, Mr. Rispoli left the apartment on 51st Street that he shared with his husband, Danyal Lawson, for one of his routine, late-night meanderings. He did not bring a wallet or his cellphone, though he may have had some pocket cash, Mr. Lawson said.

“Lou used to go out walking all the time, until two or three in the morning,” he said. “It’s just something he did from a young age to get some peace from his crazy Italian family.”

Mr. Rispoli — known by friends as the Lion for his 6-foot-2-inch frame and shaggy mop of brown hair — would strike up conversations as he wandered, never along a set route. “He was a New Yorker,” Mr. Lawson said. “He never felt unsafe.”

Whom he encountered on his walk that night remains a mystery. But shortly after 2 a.m., the witness saw Mr. Rispoli exiting a white two-door sports car with three men. As one of the men stood watch from the corner of 42nd Street, Mr. Rispoli walked between the other two along 43rd Avenue, according to the witness, who called 911.

The man on his left suddenly struck Mr. Rispoli with his fist. “I just saw one swing, one punch, nobody was pushing nobody,” said the witness, who had been standing with several others outside a corner bodega a half-block away.

Mr. Rispoli crumpled to the ground by the ornate entrance to a large apartment building at 41-00 43rd Avenue. “He was shaking,” the witness said. The men fled quickly back to the car, which he said had two mufflers, and sped off. “It made a lot of noise — worse than a motorcycle,” he said.

The police arrived minutes later to the call of an assault in progress. With Mr. Rispoli unable to communicate, a standard alternative, according to Edward Mamet, a retired captain in the New York Police Department, would have been for the responding officers to seek information from the 911 dispatcher.

“If it went out on the radio as an assault and you can’t get the story out of the victim, you can call the dispatcher and get what details they have,” Mr. Mamet said. “That’s very common.”

It was not clear if those steps were taken. Soon after, the ambulance and the police departed.

The Police Department denied a Freedom of Information request, filed on Mr. Lawson’s behalf, for transcripts of the 911 calls, radio dispatches and other police records related to the attack. An appeal, filed late last month, was denied in a department letter dated May 20 because the information relates to a continuing investigation and because “disclosure thereof could endanger the life or safety of a person.”

Mr. Van Bramer, who wrote to the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, demanding that the information request be granted, called for a full review of the police response.

“To see if there were mistakes, errors in judgment or something else that maybe, just maybe, contributed to the fact that we have a stalled investigation into a murder,” he said.

A department spokeswoman, citing the investigation by Internal Affairs, did not respond to detailed questions on the delayed investigation, but provided a short statement.

“The officers responded to the location and determined that the aided was in need of medical attention,” said the spokeswoman, Inspector Kim Y. Royster, referring to Mr. Rispoli. “They immediately requested E.M.S. who removed the male to Elmhurst Hospital. It wasn’t until Sunday, Oct. 21, 2012 that detectives were informed that the male was a victim of an assault.”

The effect of delay on the investigation was not known. The police in late January released sketches of two men with close-cropped hair, one in his 20s and the other in his 30s, who were said to be suspects in the killing, but have yet to identify any suspects. The police have not been investigating the killing as a hate crime.

Posters with the sketches hung last week on lamps near the site of the killing. On one, the faces had been scratched out.

Mr. Lawson said the killing would not prompt him to move from the Queens neighborhood where he and Mr. Rispoli lived together for decades after meeting in 1980 on the subway stairs at West Fourth Street. The couple married in 2011.

“Things were looking good for us,” Mr. Lawson said. Mr. Rispoli had recently taken an administrative job at the West Village music school where Mr. Lawson teaches.

“It’s only now that I’m even able to feel angry about it,” he said of the police actions. “I’m not into suing or anything — just find these guys.”",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Roman was arrested on charges of second- and third-degree assault as a hate crime, the police said, and was accused of beating a man with whom he had spent many hours drinking on Monday after the man told him he was gay.

“It is a shame that we have to get together to talk about some things that should never occur, that we always thought, you know, we’d gotten beyond that,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said.

The first attack took place late Monday after what began as an afternoon of drinking between two men, who had known each other about a month, turned violent, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said.

At around 10:45 p.m., as they walked near the Bowery Mission, where one of the men lives, they discussed the fact that one of them was gay.

But Mr. Morales’s sister, Edith Gutierrez, said she did not believe he could have committed a bias crime — they have relatives who are gay, she said, and Mr. Morales had shown no signs of homophobia. She also said that when Mr. Morales telephoned her from jail on Sunday, “he said he doesn’t remember anything; he was under the influence, he was drinking.”

Mr. Morales, 33, said nothing at his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court on Sunday. Judge Robert Stolz ordered him held without bail and scheduled another hearing for Thursday.

The police also questioned two men who had been with Mr. Morales just before the shooting. They were questioned as witnesses, not as suspects, and were cooperating with detectives, said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman. He did not identify them.

Mr. Morales — who had served more than 10 years in prison for a robbery conviction, according to state correction records — had been staying with one of the men in Far Rockaway, Queens. Detectives found a second gun among Mr. Morales’s belongings there, a Serbian-made Zastava that the police described as an assault weapon. Mr. Browne said that sometime earlier, the man had told Mr. Morales that it made him uncomfortable to have the gun around his children.

Mr. Carson’s killing was the first in the West Village precinct this year. In all of 2012, one homicide was reported there.

But through the first week in May, there were 57 assaults, a sharp increase over the same period last year, when there were 33. According to police statistics, the number of violent altercations is higher this year than it was a decade ago but lower than in the 1990s, when citywide crime was higher.

“Things seem a little more hostile in the Village lately,” said Glennda Testone, the executive director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center on West 13th Street. “People have been saying it’s especially on the weekends, when there is more of a commuter crowd. Perhaps what we’re seeing is that the growing approval of the L.G.B.T. community and the increasing equality isn’t reaching to every single street.”

Sharon Stapel, the executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project, said antigay violence had been worsened by the forces that are reshaping the city. “The Village has always been a place where L.G.B.T. people have felt accepted and respected,” she said, “but the Village is not immune from this vitriolic anti-L.G.B.T. violence. And we are not a homogeneous community. If you talk to young non-gender-conforming kids of color, they’re going to have a very different experience than older white L.G.B.T. people.”

The police say they have moved to stem felony assaults in the West Village that can often be traced to bar fights and late-night confrontations.

“That’s why there was an impact officer on duty there in the first place, the one who captured the shooter,” said Mr. Browne, referring to officers assigned to areas in need of additional policing. “The Village attracts crowds of visitors, especially on weekends, and impact officers are assigned there as a result.”

The police said that on Friday night, Mr. Morales and the two men had gone to the neighborhood and that Mr. Morales had urinated in front of the Annisa bar and restaurant on Barrow Street at West Fourth Street. The police said he then went inside and confronted the bartender with antigay slurs. He yanked up his sweatshirt, showing off a revolver in a shoulder holster, and threatened to kill the bartender if he called 911, the police said.

Mr. Carson and his friend went on their way, and Mr. Morales pursued them, the police said. One of Mr. Morales’s friends peeled off and left after failing to dissuade him from doing so, the police said.

“Hearing someone shout racial or homophobic slurs is not unusual here,” said Jessica Berk, a neighborhood activist and lifelong resident. “The victims of low-level crime — muggings, street harassment, attempted assault — have traditionally been gay men,” she said, adding, “It’s as if a memo goes out to all the muggers and troublemakers.”

Mark Erson, the pastor at St. John’s Lutheran Church on Christopher Street, said minutely local geography had to be factored in. “The shooting happened over on Sixth Avenue, so you know, you go one block over and there could be a complete change of feeling and atmosphere,” he said, adding that some of the violence in the neighborhood could be drug-related. “If someone strung out sees a vulnerable person, and unfortunately gay people are seen as vulnerable, one thing could lead to another.”

Mr. Carson had worked as a manager at the Ciao Bella gelato kiosk in Grand Central Terminal. Isabella Odonkor, 20, worked with him there and she said he had risen quickly, because he was “very good with people.” If someone stopped by while he was tidying up after closing time, he would still make the sale, she said.

She said that as far as she knew, Mr. Carson had always been open about being gay. “He was not afraid of it, not afraid to share it,” she said.

In a telephone interview, Mr. Vacharadze of Identoba said that priests from the Georgian Orthodox Church had led the charge that broke through a heavy police corridor.

“The priests entered, the priests broke the fences and the police didn’t stop them, because the priests are above the law in Georgia,” he said.

Ms. Bolkvadze, the lawyer with Identoba, speaking by telephone from a safe house in the city, said that despite promises from the police that there would be “unprecedented” protection for the rally, the riot police were unprepared.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/world/europe/homophobia-linked-to-murder-in-russia.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"MOSCOW — The brutal murder of a 23-year-old man in the southern city of Volgograd was motivated by homophobia, investigators said Sunday, a rare acknowledgment that comes during a period of rising conservative and antigay sentiment from Russian officials.

The man’s body was found naked in the courtyard of an apartment building, his skull smashed with a stone, and he appeared to have been sodomized with several beer bottles, according to local investigators. Natalia Kunitskaya, a spokeswoman for the Volgograd Regional Investigative Committee, said Sunday that the man’s sexual orientation appeared to be the reason that he was killed, according to the news agency RIA Novosti.

Three men have been arrested in connection with the crime, including one former classmate of the victim’s and one man who said he had watched as others beat the man to death. Federal investigators released a statement saying the crime began when a group of men who were drinking beer on Thursday in a park to commemorate the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in 1945 heard the victim say he was gay. The suspects “cruelly beat the victim,” and he “died on the spot,” investigators said.

NTV, a Russian television channel, reported that the man’s face had been so badly damaged that the police initially could not identify him. The crime’s unusual savagery made it national news in Russia. Critics of the government said Russian politicians had promoted homophobia in recent months, as part of a broad rejection of liberal influences that are seen as emanating from the West.

Early this year, by a vote of 388 to 1, Russian lawmakers approved a bill outlawing “homosexual propaganda,” with fines of up to $16,000 for violations. On two occasions, rights advocates who demonstrated against the bill were assaulted or pelted with eggs as police officers looked on. More recently, President Vladimir V. Putin has said Russia may curtail adoptions of Russian children by people from Western countries where same-sex marriage is legal.

Prosecutors are treating the investigation as a murder case, with sentences of up to 15 years for conviction.

Nikolai Alekseyev, a leading gay-rights activist in Russia, told the news agency Interfax that he was afraid that the murder in Volgograd “will be investigated as one caused by a trivial row, and the homophobic motive will gradually disappear from all the documents.” He said activists would push for the inclusion of hatred based on sexual orientation as an aggravating circumstance in violent crimes.",nytimes.com,True

The man, Ruben Ubiles, 34, of the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, was charged with burglary, arson and criminal mischief, all felony hate crimes, as well as with reckless damage and reckless endangerment, the police said, referring to the vandalism in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

On Monday, the police said, Mr. Ubiles set fire to 11 mezuzot — small cases containing Scripture that many Jews affix to their door frames — at a public-housing complex on Taylor Street in Williamsburg’s heavily Hasidic South Side. On Tuesday, the police said, he burned another mezuza a block away, on Clymer Street.

The burnings coincided with Holocaust Remembrance Day, but the police said they did not know whether it was a factor.

The police canvassed the Taylor-Wythe Houses, a public housing complex in Williamsburg, specifically 85 Taylor Street, the building where officials said that at least 11 mezuzot were found burned about 4:45 p.m. The police said that there was little other damage. As of late Monday, they said, they had no suspects.

The F.B.I. did not respond to specific questions about the things that happened at the center and another case from the same year, because some of the agents that worked in the San Francisco office in 2007 have since left, said Julianne Sohn, a bureau spokeswoman there.

She added that it was also hard to comment on individual reports without knowing if there were other related documents, but said that the F.B.I. was dedicated to looking into any hate crimes that were reported.

“Here in the Bay Area, we take hate crimes very seriously,” Ms. Sohn said. “Whenever we get any kind of allegation or complaint we look at it thoroughly.”

Reservations over how the situation at the center in Antioch was handled underscore a sometimes delicate relationship between the F.B.I. and the Muslim population near San Francisco.

About a year ago, a Freedom of Information Act request by the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California and other groups yielded about 15,000 documents detailing interactions between FBI agents and Muslims in that part of the state.

Lawyers and activists said that the documents showed that the F.B.I. had used a mosque outreach program, meant to combat hate crimes directed at Muslims, to gather information about people engaged in lawful activities. News reports followed, along with debates over how the F.B.I. should approach the Muslim population. At the time, F.B.I. officials said those operations were appropriate.

But most of the thousands of pages the F.B.I. turned over received little or no attention. Among them were reports that documented a handful of instances in which agents declined to pursue possible hate crimes.

Although the F.B.I. requires that agents examine all such claims, not all result in a full investigation. Some lack dependable evidence, and agents may determine that others do not include hate-crime components as defined by federal law. Ms. Sohn said that it could be hard to find proof of intent, a key element in demonstrating that a hate crime took place.

But Michael German, a former F.B.I. agent and now a senior policy counsel for the A.C.L.U. in Washington, said that two instances in which the San Francisco office did not pursue investigations stood out.

One involved a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, who told agents in 2007 that he had received threatening calls from blocked numbers after including his phone number on fliers promoting an antiwar protest.

One caller told the student to be “very, very careful,” an F.B.I. report stated and added, “You wouldn’t want an accident to happen to you.”

The second used a racial epithet, the agents wrote, and told the caller to blow himself up “before we do it for you.”

The report went on to note that F.B.I. records indicated that a person whose name was redacted, apparently the student, had previously written e-mails that “conveyed hatred toward the United States and Israel and support for the Palestinian cause.”

A man named Snehal Shingavi said he was the one who had received the threats and spoken with the F.B.I. He said that the agency had not accurately characterized the views he had expressed in e-mails and added that it was improper to catalog political opinions attributed to him.

“The linking of my political activity with the decision not to fully investigate the death threats is very troubling,” Mr. Shingavi said.

Also troubling, Mr. German said, was the decision not to start a hate-crime investigation after shots were fired at the Islamic Center of East Bay, given the escalating nature of the attacks there. An investigation, he said, could have solved or deterred crimes and helped foster trust between the F.B.I. and the center.

“Here was an opportunity to do something to protect the community,” Mr. German said. “There is concern in the community that the F.B.I. is viewing them through only one lens, as potential suspects.”

Mr. Rahman, from the center in Antioch, said that agents began contacting him regularly after the arson there, sometimes taking him to lunch. He was eager to establish a rapport, he said, but became uncomfortable when questions about the fire seemed to give way to questions about the center’s members.

“After you’ve been victimized, that is not something you want to hear,” Mr. Rahman said, adding that he cautioned the agents that their work in general would not benefit from such an approach, telling them: “You’re not going to build a relationship this way.”",nytimes.com,True
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/theater/reviews/the-laramie-project-at-bams-harvey-theater.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Most of the artists who undertook this long journey have been reunited for the Brooklyn Academy of Music run, which includes the New York debut of the second part. What strikes you at first is how firmly they must have kept this material in their hearts, minds, muscles and bones over the years. Those who saw the original production may be surprised at how viscerally they too respond to this newly remounted, enriched version; I certainly was. And yet on the evidence of the half-empty houses in which I saw the show, New Yorkers may be inclined to dismiss this vital production with a “been there, done that” attitude. I’d urge them to reconsider.

Photo

The effectiveness of the production, directed by Moisés Kaufman and Leigh Fondakowski, comes from the wide spectrum of perspectives it weaves together: testimony from Shepard’s friends and acquaintances, from the police officers intimately involved in bringing the perpetrators to justice, from prominent Laramie citizens who are dismayed at how their city is being portrayed, eventually from the killers themselves. For all its simplicity — the set by Robert Brill consists primarily of just a few tables and chairs on a bare wooden stage — this is a show with many working parts, and at no point do you feel that any rust has settled in the machinery. The actors slip in and out of the many real-life characters they play as if throwing on comfortable old clothes.

In many cases the clothes may not have changed, but the people wearing them have. “My gut reaction is that Laramie is a somewhat better place to be than it was 10 years ago,” says Beth Loffreda (Mercedes Herrero), a theater professor at the University of Wyoming who was extensively interviewed for Part 1. “But I don’t know how to tell the story of the past 10 years without having to think about both what we’ve done, but also what we haven’t done.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

What the second part of the show illuminates with disturbing clarity is how sharply attitudes toward the killing have changed in Laramie, how a revised history has gradually replaced the facts of the case, once undisputed. Many no longer believe Shepard’s death was a hate crime: a skewed, sensationalistic segment on the ABC News show “20/20” in 2004 with Elizabeth Vargas purported to reveal that the killing was merely a drug-related robbery gone awry, and that Shepard’s homosexuality was immaterial.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Dave O’Malley (Stephen Belber), the lead investigator in the case, whose changing attitudes toward gay people are movingly depicted in the first part, was shocked at how that program’s tendentious theorizing ignored the public record. Clearly still angered, he rails that ABC “put a piece together that’s solely based on meth heads from the Buckhorn Bar and two convicted murderers.” (The segment featured testimony from the killers that contradicted their original statements, in which Aaron McKinney casually confessed that he murdered Shepard after Shepard made sexual overtures to him; later we hear from Mr. McKinney 10 years after the crime, and he makes glaringly clear his continuing hatred of homosexuals.)

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

It is dismaying to hear that many new students at the University of Wyoming, where Shepard was a student when he was killed, and which was naturally at the center of coverage of the crime, have only vague ideas about the killing and its causes. Only 50 people attended a 10-year commemoration service at which Matthew’s father, Dennis Shepard, spoke.

But there are countervailing trends too: a bill in the State Legislature to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman was defeated, with the support of Republicans, no less. And men and women whose lives were touched by the crime have gone on to become activists fighting for gay rights. (It’s sad to be reminded that Matthew Shepard had hoped to pursue a career as a champion of human rights.)

Photo

Romaine Patterson (Libby King), a friend of Matthew’s, became a regular speaker at high schools and colleges. “We know that these crimes continue to happen,” she says, “and they are as horrific as what happened to Matthew, but these kids really want to create change, and they feel like they really can.” She adds, “So by talking about Matthew, good things happen, good change is happening.”

It will never be possible to determine how much influence the national outcry about Shepard’s murder had on the remarkable evolution in American attitudes toward gay rights. As this compassionate but always cleareyed production makes implicitly clear, it was without question a watershed moment. But homophobia has hardly been eradicated from Laramie, as it has remained alive and well throughout the country, despite the significant strides being made on the civil rights front, with gay marriage now legal in a handful of states.

The forces that will shape history are not easily discerned in the living moment, but as you watch “The Laramie Project Cycle” you cannot help being moved by how the people of this small Wyoming town have for the most part risen nobly to the responsibility imposed upon them by their proximity to the crime.

Perhaps most affecting is Shepard’s mother, Judy (Barbara Pitts), who insisted on privacy in the immediate aftermath of her son’s death but later became a dogged champion of the cause of gay rights and hate-crimes legislation.

“I was talking to someone and they said, ‘Well don’t you think maybe it’s time to let go, don’t you think you’re keeping Matt alive by doing that?’ ” she recalls. “And I said, ‘Of course I’m keeping him alive by doing this! That’s the point!’ That is exactly the point. And I can keep telling the same wonderful stories and my friends don’t say, ‘Judy, you told me that story yesterday and the day before and the day before that.’ I can just keep telling it.”

“Each of you has received the benefits of that First Amendment,” Judge Polster said.

The series of attacks in 2011 spread fear through Amish communities in eastern Ohio. Followers of Mr. Mullet broke into homes, restrained men and women, and forcibly sheared their victims, sometimes with tools used to clip horse manes.

For Amish, descendants of 18th-century German-speaking immigrants, long beards and flowing women’s hair represent religious devotion and cultural identity.

Prosecutors argued that because of the religious symbolism of the attacks, they were hate crimes. Mr. Mullet was convicted of coordinating four attacks on a total of eight victims, though by all accounts he did not directly participate.

Speaking in court Friday before the sentencing, his ankles in chains and a white beard reaching his chest, Mr. Mullet said he was being labeled a cult leader, which he denied. He asked to be given the punishment for all the defendants, who included four married couples. “Let these moms and dads go home to their families, raise their children, I’ll take the punishment for everybody,” Mr. Mullet said, according to WKYC-TV in Cleveland.

Although Mr. Mullet is an Amish bishop, his strict interpretation of his faith and an abrasive personality had caused individuals to leave his fold and other Amish leaders to isolate him. He presided over a settlement of about 18 families reached by a dirt track near the town of Bergholz.

The trial of the 16 defendants, including three of Mr. Mullet’s sons, unveiled a tiny sect in thrall to its leader, who in the name of purity abolished Sunday church services and punished men for ogling non-Amish women by confining them to chicken coops. Testimony also detailed how Mr. Mullet pressured married female followers to have sex with him, including a daughter-in-law.

Another defendant, Lester Miller, apologized before the sentencing to his parents, whom he and others, including his wife, Elizabeth Miller, had attacked. He asked the judge to spare his wife, “to put her sentence on me,” so she could care for their 11 children, according to WKYC-TV.

Many of the defendants also asked the judge to give them all or part of Mr. Mullet’s sentence and to lighten his burden.

Ms. Miller and four other women received the shortest sentence, a year and a day, and the sixth woman, Linda Schrock, was given two years.

Mr. Mullet’s lawyer, Edward G. Bryan, had argued that his client had not directly ordered the attacks and asked for a short sentence. All the defendants have two weeks to file appeals.

In handing Mr. Mullet 15 years, Judge Polster said he oversaw his flock with “an iron hand” and that he was “a danger to the community.”

Steven M. Dettelbach, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, argued in a sentencing memo that Mr. Mullet was responsible for the crimes because he preached to followers that “Amish hypocrites” should be punished.

Mr. Dettelbach said in an interview that he was satisfied that all of the defendants were given prison time.

“In court today, sitting there and watching defendant after defendant after defendant stand and say they would yet again sacrifice years of their lives so Mr. Mullet would not have to be punished, proved the court judge was absolutely right in characterizing Mr. Mullet’s control over these people,” Mr. Dettelbach said. “Whether or not you call that a cult is none of my business.”

They identified Jason Commisso, 34, as a suspect over the weekend.

The string of mostly daytime crimes followed a brutal pattern, the police said: a single robber would follow men and women — all of Asian descent, most over 40 — as they entered apartment buildings. He then shadowed them into elevators, where he would repeatedly punch them in the face before making off with their belongings. At least eight people have been attacked, the police said.

The case of Ms. Menendez, 31, puts renewed attention on a mental health system that is a loose amalgam of hospitals, supported housing, shelters and other advocacy and support groups, in which mentally ill people often bounce from one to the other and ultimately fall through the cracks. It is not known precisely where she fit in.

City officials said it would be misleading to conclude that anyone was at fault in her treatment.

“People get well and then they get sick again,” Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs Bellevue and Elmhurst Hospital Centers, said Sunday. Ms. Menendez had been treated at both hospitals, according to friends and law enforcement officials.

Ms. Marengo declined to confirm or deny whether Ms. Menendez had been treated at either hospital, citing confidentiality rules, but said that patients who were treated at city hospitals often were discharged into the care of outpatient mental health providers.

Just two months earlier, Ms. Menendez was accused of hitting and scratching another man in Queens. She was also arrested on cocaine possession charges the same year.

Since then, according to friends and people familiar with her record, she has been cared for at mental health facilities in Manhattan and Queens as her problems worsened.

Between 2005 and February this year, the police responded five times to calls from relatives reporting difficulties in dealing with Ms. Menendez, reportedly stemming from her failure to take certain medication, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak publicly about her medical history. In one of these instances, in 2010, she threw a radio at one of the responding officers, the official said.

Mr. Goldstein was convicted of second-degree murder, a decision that was overturned. But he ultimately pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Although he stopped taking medication for schizophrenia, the insanity defense did not convince a jury.

Yet in the outrage after Ms. Webdale’s death, the State Legislature passed Kendra’s Law, which allows judges to order closely supervised outpatient treatment for mentally ill patients who had a history of refusing to take their medication and who had been put in jail or hospitalized repeatedly or become violent.

The latest attacks show the flaws in the system, according to some advocates for the mentally ill.

Mr. Sen, 46, was looking out over the tracks when a woman approached him from behind and shoved him onto the tracks, according to the police. Mr. Sen never saw her, the police said.

The woman fled the station, running down two flights of stairs and down the street.

By the next morning, a brief and grainy black-and-white video of the woman who the police said was behind the attack was being broadcast on news programs.

Patrol officers picked up Ms. Menendez early Saturday after someone who had seen the video on television spotted her on a Brooklyn street and called 911, said Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department. She was taken to Queens and later placed in lineups, according to detectives. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said on Friday that, according to witnesses’ accounts, there had been no contact on the subway platform between the attacker and the victim before the shove.

The case was the second this month involving someone being pushed to death in a train station. In the first case, Ki-Suck Han, 58, of Elmhurst, Queens, died under the Q train at the 49th Street and Seventh Avenue station on Dec. 3. Naeem Davis, 30, was charged with second-degree murder in that case.

Mr. Sen, after years of saving money, had opened a small copying business on the Upper West Side this year.

Ar Suman, a Muslim, and one of three roommates who shared a small first-floor apartment with Mr. Sen in Elmhurst, said he and Mr. Sen often discussed religion.

Though they were of different faiths, Mr. Suman said, he admired the respect that Mr. Sen showed for those who saw the world differently than he did. Mr. Suman said he once asked Mr. Sen why he was not more active in his faith and it resulted in a long philosophical discussion.

“He was so gentle,” Mr. Suman said. “He said in this world a lot of people are dying, killing over religious things.”",nytimes.com,True

She and her husband, Lester Miller, took part in the assault on his parents in September 2011, shearing the father’s beard and the mother’s hair, both treasured symbols of Amish identity; he is among the men being held without bail.

The parents had condemned Mr. Mullet as a cult leader, but Mrs. Miller, her husband and several of his siblings and their spouses remained loyal to Mr. Mullet’s vision of a more “pure” Amish community. In courtroom testimony, one of the 12 attackers said they had considered the parents to be straying hypocrites who needed a lesson.

Now, preparing for prison even as she prays for leniency, Mrs. Miller has arranged for a cousin, Mary Mast, 47, to take care of her children, who range in age from 1 to 15.

Several years leading up to the assaults had been marked by feuds with outsiders and wrenching internal strife, culminating in the five separate attacks on Mr. Mullet’s Amish critics that brought calamity to the community.

With nine male breadwinners — half the married men — in federal prison, residents say they have pulled together as never before.

The hardships were eased by a $3 million payment for gas exploration rights on Mr. Mullet’s 700 acres, an offer that arrived, providentially, just as the leader and his followers faced financial ruin. Mr. Mullet used part of it to pay off his mortgage and those of his sons on adjacent land.

Martha Mullet, his wife of 46 years, was not charged with any crime and is managing the rest of the money. She has paid for the $250 van rides to the prison and doled out cash to families struggling without fathers — generosity that has bound together this community but also deepened the dependence of some.

“We are praying that God will send another miracle,” Mrs. Mullet, 64, said of the hope that the judge will give the men short sentences and the women probation.

While admitting that the attacks were a mistake, many church members and Mr. Mullet himself, who spoke in a two-hour interview at the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center in Youngstown, called the hate-crime charges overly harsh.

Prosecutors have described the clan’s unorthodox practices as signs of Mr. Mullet’s dictatorial domination. Those practices included earlier beard-cutting of men by their own wives for ogling “English” women at Walmart, the forcing of men to do penance for impure thoughts by making them sleep in chicken coops and Mr. Mullet’s decision to abolish formal church services as meaningless displays.

His followers say they accepted these acts to get closer to God. Shorn of their beards, the men were supposed to confront their sinful ways and redouble their faith.

Even now, Bergholz residents do not seem to fully understand how terrifying these practices were to outside Amish communities, who heard of brethren assaulted in their homes at night and humiliated with scissors, clippers and shears designed to trim horse manes.

Mr. Mullet, who was also accused in trial testimony of engaging in intimate sexual “counseling” of female followers, claimed he never had sex with them. He has been maligned by lurid rumors, he said, spread by Amish rivals who resented him for exposing their sins.

Because the convictions described the forcible restraint of the victims as kidnapping, Judge Dan Aaron Polster, of Federal District Court in Cleveland, will have unusually wide discretion in sentencing and could hand down anything from probation to life sentences, said Edward G. Bryan, Mr. Mullet’s lawyer. The prosecution has indicated that it will seek lengthy prison terms for at least several of the men.

Throughout the arrests, the trial and now the tense waiting, only one member of the group, a 19-year-old grandson of Mr. Mullet’s, has left Bergholz. The rest have vowed to stick together, following the vision that brought Mr. and Mrs. Mullet here nearly 18 years ago, and to stay removed from what they describe as rampant drinking, smoking, use of musical instruments, premarital sex and other sins of nearby Amish.

“No matter if he gets life in prison, he will still be our bishop here,” said Wilma Mullet, 30, one of Mr. Mullet’s daughters, who did not participate in the 2011 attacks.

Mr. Mullet’s stature was clear on Thanksgiving Day, when he conducted the marriage service for his youngest daughter, Lizzie, and Ferdinand Miller, whose father is also being held. Mr. Mullet presided from behind glass in a prison visitor room, reciting vows and prayers via telephone as nearly 20 Bergholz residents stood behind the couple on the other side, then returned to their settlement for a bittersweet celebratory dinner.

But in Bergholz last week, she burst into tears as she bemoaned the upheaval and what she sees as the unfair severity of the prosecutions.

“We’re not denying that we did wrong,” she said, “but it should never have been classified as a hate crime.” Her sons felt they had a reason for the attacks, she added, “because of the way our community was being treated.”

“They can go on with their lives,” Mrs. Mullet said of the shearing victims. “Their hair and beards will grow back.”

“But they don’t want our families to have any lives at all,” she said.

In the prison interview, Mr. Mullet, 67, in a yellow jumpsuit, complained of the conditions in the section of the Youngstown prison reserved for those awaiting sentencing. He said inmates are locked up several times a day in 6-by-12-foot cells that were built for two people but now have a third bunk on the wall and an open toilet with no privacy.

The men have kept their beards and mostly keep to themselves, Mr. Mullet said, but they do not pray together. “How do you live an Amish life with 100 inmates screaming and cussing?” he said.

By all accounts, Mr. Mullet did not participate in the attacks, but he was convicted as a co-conspirator. He sought to play down the strength of his authority.

After learning of the first attack, he recalled, “I said, ‘If you’re going to do something like that, leave me out of it.’ ”

“I guess I didn’t want my beard cut off, and that probably would have happened if I had tried to stop them,” he said. “The only thing I did wrong was that I didn’t tell them to stop.”

But this month, Judge Polster, as he denied Mr. Mullet’s request for a new trial, said the jury had good reason to place Mr. Mullet at the heart of the conspiracy.

“Suffice it to say, the evidence at trial conclusively established that defendant, as bishop of Bergholz, ran his community with an iron fist,” the judge wrote in a ruling on Dec. 6. “Nothing of significance happened without his knowledge and approval.”",nytimes.com,True

Chief Lanier says the department has been doing everything in its power to stem the violence, going so far as to seek an outside review of the department’s procedures that have been the subject of criticism. The results of that review are expected late this year or in early 2013.

“We feel like everything that we can do, we’re doing, and yet we get these complaints back from some of the advocates,” she said.

The tensions peaked last year after a wave of high-profile attacks, including a street killing and an episode in which an off-duty police officer shot at transgender women he tried to solicit for sex. The officer, Kenneth Furr, was convicted last month.

There have been no street killings this year, but neither has there been a lull in the violence. Through October, the department had recorded 51 hate crimes against gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender residents, just short of the record 53 for all of 2011. This spring, two back-to-back attacks in Columbia Heights prompted a march through the neighborhood.

After Chief Lanier took over in 2007, she made changes to the department’s gay and lesbian unit, which had won a prestigious award from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government the year before and a $100,000 grant. (Similar specialized units focus on the city’s Asian, deaf and Latino residents.)

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The changes included distributing the unit’s duties to officers throughout the city, rather than clustering the officers in Dupont Circle, once the city’s gay epicenter. Those officers, numbering about 100 in all, received training for interacting with gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender residents.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Critics say that the vaunted unit has languished, and that sprinkling its duties departmentwide — while a promising idea — has not proved effective because not all officers have received the training to recognize and respond appropriately to a hate crime.

“The events of 2011, the intense violence, really showed that the restructuring had failed to create any kind of meaningful reaction and response,” said Jason A. Terry, an anti-violence activist and a volunteer with the DC Trans Coalition.

In the Columbia Heights case last month, gay and lesbian advocates have questioned why the responding officer did not recognize potential signs of a hate crime and initially recorded it as not being one.

Chief Lanier said the victim initially did not tell the responding officer about the slurs that were shouted. After word reached the gay and lesbian unit that bias may have played a role, members of the unit reinterviewed the man, who is Latino, and afterward determined that his attacker had yelled ethnic and antigay slurs. The attack is now under investigation as a hate crime, she said. “That was not mishandled by police officers,” she said.

The chief was adamant that spreading out the duties of the unit throughout the city was a wise decision. “Where we only had five people before, now I’ve got over 100 people and they’re spread out around the city, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” she said. “Now they can serve a much larger population.”

Few doubt that the department takes the violence seriously, and many see positive signs in recent efforts to collaborate with anti-violence groups. That includes a task force that meets to review crime data and organize trainings for officers.

“They’re not perfect, and I don’t think they ever will be, but I do believe that they are engaged with the community,” June Crenshaw, the chairwoman of the anti-violence Rainbow Response Coalition, said of the department.

Yet frustrations linger. Gay and lesbian community leaders were astonished to learn recently that the department had instigated an internal affairs inquiry into the Kennedy School grant that the unit won in 2006 and that it had abandoned a non-department Web site with information for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender residents, like safety tips and links to outside organizations, after a volunteer said he could no longer maintain the site, which was financed by the grant.

A nonprofit organization that has handled the money for the last few years accounted for all the expenditures and remaining funds, which total slightly more than $49,000, according to a tabulation provided by the treasurer of the group, called Brother, Help Thyself.

Chief Lanier said the investigation was only to determine where money for the volunteer Web site was coming from. “There was no misuse of the funds,” she said.

Virtually every major metropolitan police department has some unit or protocols for responding to hate crimes against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender residents, but Washington’s unit has long been considered a model, said Sharon Stapel, the executive director of the Anti-Violence Project in New York.

While relations with the department have sometimes been fraught of late, little of that tension was evident at a recent open house for the unit. In the freshly painted basement of the building near Dupont Circle, community activists crowded around trays of shrimp and cold cuts.

A member of the unit handed out commendations to activists, and a comedian performed a stand-up act. Officers brought out a sheet cake and sang “Happy Birthday” to the assistant chief, Diane Groomes, who acknowledged that relations had been strained.

“I know we’re not perfect and we have a way to go, but I think little by little, with support of the community, we’re definitely getting better every day,” she said.

Some attendees said they were pleased with department efforts to mend relationships with the city’s gay and lesbian residents. Ruby Corado, 42, who runs a transgender advocacy group, said she was impressed by changes in the department.

“I have seen a huge improvement,” she said, as she nibbled on shrimp. “I have seen the attitude of some officers changing. Before it was all bad, honestly, I have to say.”

Others are not yet convinced. A. J. Singletary, a co-chairman of a city anti-violence group called Gays and Lesbians Opposing Violence, said he feared that Chief Lanier’s commitment to improvement had not reached all the way through the ranks of the department.

In search of leads, detectives spent much of the weekend poring over surveillance video from around the Flatbush Avenue shop where the latest victim, Rahmatollah Vahidipour, 78, died from three gunshot wounds on Friday, and released images of four people wanted for questioning, including a woman seen running away from a man.

By Monday, their attention had narrowed to one person seen on video and identified by the police only by the bag he was carrying.

“We’re focused on identifying ‘John Doe Duffel Bag,’ ” said Paul J. Browne, the department’s chief spokesman.

Mr. Browne did not elaborate on what led the police to home in on that man in particular, but said the woman running near the crime scene was suspected of stealing from a perfume vendor, seen on the video chasing her.

Surveillance cameras captured the man with the duffel bag walking northbound on Flatbush Avenue roughly a block and a half north of Mr. Vahidipour’s shop at 6 p.m. on Friday, the police said, placing him in the area during the window when detectives believe the killing occurred. Another video camera captured him minutes later and half a block farther north, walking in the same direction.

The Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, said in a news conference on Monday that there did not appear to be anything tying the three victims — Mr. Vahidipour; Isaac Kadare, 59, killed on Aug. 2; and Mohamed Gebeli, 65, on July 6 — to each other. “There is nothing about the victims that would suggest anything other than they were just the victims of a random execution,” Mr. Hynes said.

The shootings recalled the serial killings of four shopkeepers in Brooklyn and Queens in 2003 by Larme Price, who went after the men because he believed they were of Middle Eastern descent; only one was. Mr. Price, who had a history of mental health problems, is serving a life term.

By exploiting a security void and rising xenophobia, the party won a seat on the Athens City Council in 2010. In Greece’s election earlier this year, the party capitalized on widespread anti-immigrant sentiment and contempt for a political establishment that brought the country to the brink of economic collapse. It won almost 7 percent of the national vote and 18 seats in Parliament.

Recent polls show that its strength continues to grow, and its support runs as high as 50 percent among police officers, who routinely fail to investigate growing numbers of hate crimes.

Far-right ultranationalist groups are exploiting old enmities and new fears across the Continent. Although this is not the Europe of the 1930s, the disillusioned citizens of countries like Greece and Hungary have turned increasingly to simple answers, electing parties that blame familiar scapegoats — Jews, Gypsies, gays and foreigners — for their ills.

Beneath the looming basilica of Athens’ largest church, middle-aged men and women in black Golden Dawn T-shirts were busy one bright September morning distributing food to needy Greeks. Kids ran across the courtyard, which was painted with the party’s unofficial platform: “Get foreigners out of Greece.” Clusters of fit, stoic young men in dark glasses ringed the perimeter.

Nikolaos Michos, a square-jawed Golden Dawn member of Parliament with the build and tattoos of a heavyweight boxer, leaned against a bloodmobile watching. He wore a black polo embossed with the party’s Swastika-like logo. “We’re fighters and we’re not going to back down,” he said, referring to death threats from leftists and the burning of a Golden Dawn office. “But they’re not striking fear into us because every center they destroy, we’ll build new ones,” he added.

Maria Chandraki, 29, an unemployed beautician, hadn’t heard of Golden Dawn until the last election. “Their positions may be extreme,” she said, holding plastic bags of food she’d just received. “But the situation is extreme as well. So we need extreme measures.” She went on, “We can’t have so many nations and so many different sets of values and ideals under the same roof.”

A few blocks down the street, a crowd was leaving a mosque after Friday Prayer. At the mention of Golden Dawn, immigrant men began lifting their shirts to show their scars. A short, sullen-looking young man with a cut across his nose and freshly sutured cheekbone, was pushed forward by the crowd. Just the night before, he said, he was beaten and cut with a knife by “fascists.”

NIKOS KATAPODIS, 69, can see the crossroads where his family has lived since 1863. A bald, chain-smoking funeral-home owner, Mr. Katapodis describes the Greek government with a string of expletives. The flood of immigrants over the last decade created ghettos in central Athens, he explains. Crime rates rose, property values dropped and bars appeared on second-floor windows. “It looks like a prison,” he said, nodding to the street. “Today it reminds me of the late 1940s,” he adds. “You see people scrounging for food in the trash cans.”

Although he didn’t vote for Golden Dawn, he sees it as “the only party that is actually doing things for the Greek people” — a cross between the welfare state and the Mafia. If he needed an escort to walk down the street or help paying for his cancer medicine, he’d call Golden Dawn. “They’re doing what the politicians should be doing,” he said. “There’s a hole, and they fill it.”

Authoritarian elements in the Greek government have a history of using far-right groups to outsource political violence against critics. Recent moves to rein in Golden Dawn came only after it grew too powerful to control and the state felt its own authority was challenged, explained Anastassia Tsoukala, a legal scholar. “They were bitten by their own snake,” she said. And Greece is not alone. Golden Dawn’s rise has parallels across Europe, and its significance should be of Continental concern.

IN September, I sat in a Budapest courthouse as four men with tattoos and shaved heads filed past in handcuffs. Called the Death Squad, the men were charged with six murders during a wave of attacks against the country’s Roma minority, including one in which the attackers tossed a Molotov cocktail at a house and then gunned down a father and his 5-year-old son as they tried to escape the flames.

In the wake of the Death Squad murders, Kristof Domina founded the Athena Institute to monitor European extremist groups. The Budapest-based institute’s Web site features a map of 114 extremist groups active in 13 European countries. Although there are reports that these groups communicate and sometimes travel across the Continent in search of weapons or training, the problem hasn’t been dealt with at a Pan-European level.

Unlike Greece, Hungary has a history of fascist groups, including the Hungarian National Front, an anti-Semitic, anti-Roma group that established an annual international neo-Nazi event and regularly holds paramilitary training exercises on a former Soviet military base (“an incubator for the Breivik-type people,” says Mr. Domina, referring to the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik). Since Hungary’s economic crisis began, new extremist groups have emerged and the Hungarian National Front has gained national prominence.

In 2009, Jobbik, a self-described “radically patriotic Christian party” with an affiliated militia, entered Hungary’s Parliament. To rally its base, the party often relies on hate marches and intimidation campaigns that stoke racist fervor.

While Jobbik has traditionally tried to distance itself from more extreme groups, its true colors were on display at an August rally in the village of Devecser, where a Jobbik member of Parliament delivered the opening address. Subsequent speeches from other groups grew increasingly violent, climaxing in a tirade about “how the Roma people have to die and you have to kill them and we have to clean out the country,” as one witness recalled. The crowd eventually began throwing stones at Roma houses, chanting “you will die” and vowing to return.

Hungary’s ruling center-right party, Fidesz, is eager to win back some far-right voters it lost to Jobbik, so it won’t push back. Since being elected in 2010, Fidesz has pursued its own campaign of democratic rollback. Gerrymandered election districts, centralized control over the courts and the press and a new Constitution that dismantles checks and balances have caused discomfort in Brussels. In February, European Commissioner Neelie Kroes threatened to initiate proceedings that could strip Hungary of its European Union voting rights due to its controversial media laws. But that hasn’t happened yet — most likely because Brussels lacks enforcement mechanisms short of this “nuclear option.”

European leaders must not cede the battleground in the war of ideas. They should publicly denounce parties that espouse racist doctrines and spew hate-filled rhetoric and clearly define and defend the shared values of an increasingly integrated Europe.

To do so, they must develop a Pan-European approach to monitoring hate crimes and investigating right-wing extremist networks that operate across borders. And the European Union must ensure that all member states, old and new, respect the same criteria that countries currently aspiring to join the European Union are required to meet, especially maintaining the “stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights, respect for and protection of minorities.” Otherwise, Europe faces the specter of more xenophobic violence and the unraveling of the liberal democratic order that has drawn so many persecuted people to seek asylum and opportunity on European shores.

The Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted Young, a free-agent outfielder, stood by the seriousness of the sentence.

“We have to identify these offenses as hate crimes,” District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a telephone interview Wednesday, “and get the best outcomes for the victims and offenders. What we’re trying to get at is dealing with the underlying offense and bring closure to the victims and change the behavior.”

“Does it really have to be this way?” the video asks.

From there, visitors walk into the main exhibition space, where a video focuses on the power of words from leaders to ignite hope or hate. Next are provocative images of stereotypes from newspapers, magazines, advertisements and elsewhere in pop culture. Sports pops up here, too, when the display shows the logo of the Washington Redskins.

The museum’s path leads past computers filled with examples of digital terrorism and hate groups, culled by the museum’s organizers. Panels in the background show images from the Oklahoma City bombing and the outcries over the murders of James Byrd Jr., a black man killed by white supremacists in Texas, and Matthew Shepard, a Wyoming college student killed for being gay. There is a section titled Assuming Responsibility that teaches about hate-crime legislation, volunteering, nonviolent protesters and the efforts of first responders.

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/world/europe/masked-thugs-attack-gay-bar-in-moscow.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"MOSCOW — The police in Moscow on Friday were seeking two dozen masked men who stormed one of the city’s most popular gay bars early Thursday and beat patrons — most of them women — with fists and bottles. More than 10 people were injured, and three women and a man were hospitalized after the attack, which coincided with a “Coming Out Day” party, club employees said.

The violence comes during an unnerving year for gay men and lesbians in Russia. Three cities, including St. Petersburg, have passed laws criminalizing “homosexual propaganda,” and a spokesman for the Russian Orthodox Church, the country’s predominant faith, has endorsed an initiative to introduce the laws nationwide.

So far, no such law has been passed in the capital. However, a measure banning gay pride parades in Moscow for a century, until May 2112, was upheld by the city’s highest court in August.

More than 50 people were in the club, 7freedays, one of a handful of gay-friendly bars in the city, when the attackers entered, wearing surgical masks and hoods. Some revelers initially took them for performers planning to join an open-mic session, but then they began to overturn tables and assault patrons, witnesses said.",nytimes.com,True

The jury, which had no Amish members, heard three weeks of testimony and deliberated more than four days before reaching a verdict at midday on Thursday.

Although Mr. Mullet did not directly participate, prosecutors labeled him the mastermind of the assaults, in which groups of his followers invaded the homes of victims, threw them down and sheared their beards and hair. Among the traditional Amish, men’s long beards and women’s uncut hair are central to religious identity.

Prosecutors argued that the attacks were intended to humiliate those who questioned Mr. Mullet’s cultlike methods, which included forcing errant followers to sleep in chicken coops and pressing married women — including his own daughter-in-law — to accept his intimate sexual “counseling.”

Some of the victims had angered Mr. Mullet by refusing to honor his shunning decrees against his foes, calling them an improper use of his power as a bishop and accepting those he sought to banish into their own churches. Other victims had moved out of his settlement and attacked him as a cult leader.

The peculiar attacks first drew national attention last fall when several men from the Bergholz settlement were arrested on state kidnapping and burglary charges. The assaults, and then the public trial, were a searing experience for the region’s Amish, who normally lead placid and intensely private lives, without electricity or cars, and try to settle disputes peacefully without involving law enforcement.

The testimony included an elderly woman’s account of her terror as six of her children and their spouses made a surprise late-night visit, with the men holding down her sobbing husband as they hacked off his beard and hair and the women cut her waist-length hair to above the ears as she prayed aloud.

During the testimony, the 16 defendants, in traditional attire, and their lawyers sat around four tables that took up half the courtroom. In the gallery sat dozens of Amish supporters of the victims, including several of Mr. Mullet’s elderly siblings, who shook their heads as witnesses described his unorthodox methods. Also in the gallery was Mr. Mullet’s wife, who sat impassively as a woman who used to live in Bergholz spoke of how Mr. Mullet pressured her to come to his bed.

The stakes for the defendants were raised when federal prosecutors stepped in to charge Mr. Mullet and 15 others, including several of his children and other relatives, with federal conspiracy and hate-crime charges that carry potential sentences of several decades. Judge Dan Aaron Polster scheduled sentencing for Jan. 24.

The defendants did not deny their roles in the attacks, which were carried out with battery-powered clippers, scissors and razor-sharp shears that are designed to trim horse manes. Rather, the case turned on the motives for the attacks and whether it was appropriate to make them into a major federal case under a 2009 hate-crimes law.

To prove the most serious charges, the jurors had to be convinced that the defendants had caused “bodily injury,” which could mean “disfigurement,” and that the attacks were based mainly on religious differences. Lawyers for the defense argued that cutting hair was not disfigurement and that the attacks resulted from family and personal differences, including a bitter custody battle involving a daughter of Mr. Mullet’s, as well as disputes over the “true” Amish way.

During the trial, Edward G. Bryan, Mr. Mullet’s lawyer, said that his client might have known about the attacks but did not order them. According to testimony, Mr. Mullet stayed up late to greet attackers when they returned to the compound after one of the assaults, accepting a bag of shorn hair as well as disposable cameras used to record the victims’ humiliation. The prosecutors argued that his followers would not have acted without Mr. Mullet’s approval, citing what one of his sisters called the zombielike obedience of Bergholz residents.

Prosecutors say the defendants planned or took part in at least one of five attacks, cutting off Amish men’s beards and women’s hair because they carry spiritual significance in the faith. They were charged with hate crimes because prosecutors believe that religious differences brought about the attacks. None of the defense lawyers denied that hair-cuttings took place and some said their clients had taken part, but they said what happened did not amount to hate crimes. The lawyers said in opening statements that members of the breakaway group took action out of compassion and concern that some Amish were straying from their beliefs and likened the dispute to a family feud.

To many outside his clique, Mr. Mullet’s decision to have the women switch from caps to what others disparaged as “skimpy scarves” was one more sign that he was isolating his flock and leading them into sin.

Adopting different headgear was hardly Mr. Mullet’s most serious transgression in the years leading up to last fall’s violence. According to Amish critics, Mr. Mullet created a cult with decidedly un-Amish traits, including sexual favors for the bishop (himself), unheard-of methods of discipline, such as forcing miscreants to ponder their sins in a chicken coop, and festering anger at those who quit his church.

For the Amish, the minute practices of daily life, from hair coverings to choice of buggy wheels, are intertwined with their fundamentalist Christian beliefs.

The 16 defendants could be tried for simple assault without going into the fine points of what those on both sides call the Amish way. But to prove the far more serious hate-crime charges brought here by the United States attorney, Steven M. Dettelbach, prosecutors must show that religious differences drove the attacks. Groups from Mr. Mullet’s 18-family settlement near Bergholz, Ohio, are accused of forcibly shearing the beards and hair of perceived enemies.

So prosecutors have stressed the religious aspects of Mr. Mullet’s bitter feuds with critics and those who dared flee his settlement, and whom he accused of doing the Devil’s work. They have heard Amish describe how profoundly their self-worth is tied to their uncut beards — Mr. Mullet’s is a foot long — and hair. One of the forcibly shorn men, his wife said, sat through dinners holding his napkin over his chin.

To counter the hate-crime charges, defense lawyers have tried to focus instead on the personal grudges and family disputes that affected the choice of victims.

Between the symbol-laden appearance of many in the courtroom and statements that, coming from the reticent Amish, can only be called startling, the trial has presented a spectacle. Mr. Mullet’s wife, Martha, sat impassively as she heard her daughter-in-law describe being repeatedly forced into sex with Mr. Mullet, only to have him call her a whore when she finally refused. Two of Mr. Mullet’s brothers and two of his sisters in the gallery — in caps, not scarves — barely concealed their disgust as defense lawyers described his odd practices as true Amish.

Most of the witnesses speak Pennsylvania Dutch at home, and some apologized as they groped for the right English word.

Conservative Amish end schooling at the eighth grade and do not watch television. The girls are taught to cook, sew, raise children and obey their husbands. The Bergholz women in the courtroom, who have led particularly isolated lives, watched raptly as two female prosecutors managed the government’s case and as a federal marshal with pink handcuffs on her belt stood by. (All the court-appointed defense lawyers are men.)

Because it was so central to Mr. Mullet’s disputes, the jurors got a quick education in the Amish tradition of shunning, or excommunicating of individuals who defiantly stray from the path. “It’s a last resort” and “a heartbreaking thing to do,” testified Andy Hershberger, who was attacked along with his 76-year-old father, Raymond, in October by some of Samuel Mullet’s sons, wielding razor-sharp horse shears for clipping horse manes.

Shunnings should occur only after months of discussion and a near-unanimous vote of the congregation, Mr. Hershberger said. Normally, other Amish groups respect the decision and tell the offender he must make amends with his original church.

Attackers told the elder Mr. Hershberger that he became a target because he had joined other Amish leaders in rejecting Mr. Mullet’s use of shunning decrees against people who quit his settlement.

Some 300 bishops from three states gathered in 2006 in Ulysses, Pa., to discuss the issue. They appointed a committee, including Mr. Hershberger, that made the rare decision not to honor Mr. Mullet’s decrees.

It was a stinging rebuke that Mr. Mullet never forgave.

The story of Bergholz is filled with contradictions. An adult daughter of Barbara and Martin Miller told the court how she and five brothers went to live with Mr. Mullet’s group because it offered a more conservative, biblical Amish life. Compelled to testify for the prosecution, that daughter, Nancy M. Burkholder, also said the children had deeply resented their father’s constant criticism.

Yet those children cast their lot with a leader whose teachings are far from orthodox, and who is known for vindictive rages.

The women of Bergholz, according to testimony, became angry a year or two back at their husbands, accusing them of ogling “English” women, as non-Amish are called, while shopping. The unrest reached the point where, under Mr. Mullet’s supervision, several men had to spend days in chicken coops and consent to beard-shearing to help them renew their faith.

Yet some of these same women, according to testimony that went unchallenged by the defense, accepted Mr. Mullet’s intimate sexual “counseling” and urged others to give in to his ministrations.

The Amish are nothing if not private, and the airing of family rifts and church battles has, for many, been little short of a cataclysm. Barbara Miller, who is Mr. Mullet’s sister, had to listen as her daughter exclaimed to the world she was a bad parent; then she had to describe how her children and their spouses came one night to cut her husband’s beard and her own waist-length hair, and how they called their parents “godless” and collected the shorn locks in a paper bag to present to Mr. Mullet.

“He told me the other ladies had done the same thing,” Mrs. Mullet said, and that her husband “would not get better” if she did not accept his attentions.

“I didn’t want to do it, but I was afraid not to,” she said, bursting into tears. “I thought if this is what it takes to help Eli, I’ll do it.”

In other signs of Mr. Mullet’s control over followers, which led other Amish to condemn his methods, Mrs. Mullet said that church members had to get permission from him to send letters to outsiders and that he often read them first, and also read their incoming mail.

Further criticism of Mr. Mullet came on Wednesday and Thursday morning in testimony from his sister Barbara Miller. After six of her seven children moved to Bergholz, saying they wanted to lead more conservative Amish lives, Mrs. Miller and her husband followed them in 2007.

Mrs. Miller testified that after three and a half months she and her husband left, because, she said, she saw that her brother had become a “dictator.” Her children and others there, she said, had become like “zombies; there was no emotion.”

Mrs. Miller and her husband, Martin, who live two hours north of Bergholz, were the first victims in the beard and hair attacks. Last Sept. 6, their six estranged children and their spouses pushed into their house and sheared Mr. Miller’s beard and hair, then cut Mrs. Miller’s waist-length hair to above her ears.

Some of the defendants have acknowledged taking part in last fall’s attacks, which involved people Mr. Mullet had labeled enemies for questioning his methods or for helping residents of the settlement escape. The defendants have pleaded not guilty, and their court-appointed lawyers have challenged the application of hate crime laws to what they describe as a religious dispute.

In pretrial hearings, Judge Dan Aaron Polster of Federal District Court ruled that the prosecutors may not refer to Mr. Mullet’s group as a “cult” or as “renegade” in front of the jury, though witnesses will not be so restricted. Judge Polster denied a defense request to ban evidence about Mr. Mullet’s sexual counseling, accepting the prosecution argument that his tight control over the community was central to the case.

Mr. Mullet did not personally attack his opponents but, according to prosecutors, plotted the assaults with followers and later destroyed evidence, including a bag of shorn hair and a woman’s sliced-up bonnet.

In a pretrial brief, the prosecutors provided new details about five separate attacks on Mr. Mullet’s perceived enemies. In the first, which took place the night of Sept. 6, a group of 12 men and women hired a driver to take them to a home nearly two hours away. According to prosecutors, the two victims — the parents of six of the defendants — had questioned Mr. Mullet’s methods.

The parents said they were initially relieved to see that it was their own children knocking on the door at 10:30 p.m. But the group dragged the father to a chair and cut his beard “down to the skin as he cried and screamed for them to stop,” the prosecutors said. Five female attackers then cut off two feet of the mother’s hair as she prayed for God to forgive them, according to the brief.

Later in September, one of the defendants invited his brother-in-law to visit him in the Bergholz settlement to discuss his concerns about Mr. Mullet. A group met him for an ostensibly friendly lunch, but secretly put a laxative in his coffee, cut off his beard and hair and used a disposable camera to photograph his humiliation.

On Oct. 4, the brief said, more than 25 Bergholz residents went to the home of a 76-year-old bishop who, years earlier, was part of a group that refused to endorse Mr. Mullet’s request to shun people who fled his settlement.

Their distinct religious identity (uncut hair, turban, beard) has historically marked Sikhs, particularly men, as targets for discrimination, both in their homeland in South Asia and in the various communities of the Sikh diaspora. And of course, 9/11 brought about a surge in fear and persecution directed at Sikhs, Muslims and other minorities with ties to the Middle East and South Asia.

There is also the question of whether white supremacist groups have specifically targeted American Sikhs. The authorities in Southern California, where Mr. Page was active in the white-power music scene, are investigating whether he was involved in the killings of two elderly Sikh men in Elk Grove, Calif., in March 2011. Just after the temple shooting, a Sikh man in Oak Creek, Wis., reported that a white man had pulled up next to him in a pickup truck, shaped his hands like a gun, and pretended to shoot him six times before stating, “We want to kill all of you.”

And on Aug. 15, 10 days after the Oak Creek shooting, another member of the Sikh community there, Dalbir Singh, 56, was killed in the armed robbery of a local convenience store. (While the police have not uncovered any evidence to treat the killing as a hate crime, many Sikhs have wondered if the violence was more than random.)

White supremacist Web sites clearly demonstrate intentional, targeted anti-Sikh sentiments. For example, the leading neo-Nazi figure Alex Linder was quoted as saying on a right-wing Web site: “Take your dead and go back to India and dump their ashes in the Ganges, Sikhs. You don’t belong here in the country my ancestors fought to found, and deeded to me and mine, their posterity. Even if you came here legally, and even if you haven’t done anything wrong personally. Go home, Sikhs. Go home to India where you belong. This is not your country, it belongs to white men.”

The “mistaken identity” assumption is directly associated with a second problem: a lack of data about the extent of anti-Sikh hatred.

The F.B.I. currently classifies nearly all hate violence against American Sikhs as instances of anti-Islamic or anti-Muslim hate crimes. As a result, we do not have official statistics on the extent of hate crimes in which Sikhs are targeted, despite a long history of such violence.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Why is this so? The F.B.I. tracks hate crimes on the basis of bias motivation, even if the victim is not part of the group that was targeted. The official Hate Crime Incident Report allows authorities to register a hate crime under one of five categories: race, ethnicity (including Hispanic identity), religion, sexual orientation or disability. Within those five categories are 22 subcategories, none of them designated “anti-Sikh.” Thus the F.B.I. classifies anti-Sikh crimes as “anti-Islamic (Muslim).”

We call on the F.B.I. to begin tracking anti-Sikh violence. This does not require legislation or executive order. Since the original enactment of the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990, the F.B.I. has updated its reporting methods. For example, the bureau has revised its approach to tracking hate crimes based on sexual orientation, and now includes “anti-L.G.B.T.,” “anti-heterosexual” and “anti-bisexual” along with the “anti-gay” and “anti-lesbian” subcategories.

The legacy of anti-Sikh violence and its contemporary prevalence make it painfully obvious that anti-Sikh violence is often purposeful and targeted. The government must begin tracking and counting anti-Sikh hate crimes, just as it must continue to vigorously combat bias and discrimination against all Americans, including Muslims. We must do away with a flawed and incomplete assumption of “mistaken identity” regarding Sikhs; until we do, we will all be the ones who are mistaken.",nytimes.com,True

As with many young men and women who join white power groups, it was the music scene that helped solidify Mr. Page’s commitment to the movement, in his case the vibrant scene in Southern California, where one of us, Pete Simi, met and interviewed him in the early 2000s. Mr. Page connected with extremist communities, found mutual support for virulent racist fantasies and made a name for himself by performing in notorious white power bands, like Youngland, Intimidation One, End Apathy and Definite Hate.

The bands’ lyrics range from subtle and vaguely hortatory to aggressively, explicitly racist. But it is not the lyrics that unite Aryans. The collective events where the music is performed, like private backyard parties, bar concerts and multiday music festivals, are where they meet and support their common stance against the mainstream world.

The music does more than convey anger, hatred and outrage toward racial enemies; like all music, it is heavy with emotions like power, pride, dignity, love and pleasure, which create a collective bond that strengthens members’ commitment to the cause.

Many white power music events are tightly controlled in ways that limit attendance to neo-Nazi sympathizers and keep them mostly hidden from public view. Organizing the events as “white-only, members-only” spaces is a calculated effort to create collective experiences where, at least momentarily, adherents can experience the world they idealize: where enemies of whites are vanquished and Aryans rule.

The reach of white power music stretches far beyond the collective gatherings into Aryans’ everyday lives. Neo-Nazis download Aryan music, stream audio and video Webcasts of performances, read fanzines and music blogs, and chat online in white power music Web forums.

With just a few keystrokes, any Internet search can link Aryans to sites featuring MP3s of their favorite bands, along with T-shirts, jewelry, hats and other symbols of racist music culture. They can carry their music with them electronically to school and work, where they don headphones and secretly connect to a broad music scene that nurtures their virulent racism.

Sikhism, a monotheistic faith that emerged from the Punjab region of India about 500 years ago, is one of the world’s youngest major religions. It emphasizes self-reliance and individual responsibility and draws its tenets from the words of 10 gurus. The last guru, named Singh, as are many Sikhs today, died in 1708.

More than many other religious practitioners, Sikh men wear a uniform: unshorn hair and a small comb covered by a turban; a steel bracelet; and, for a certain group of initiates, a sword known as a kirpan.

The religion is known for promoting women to positions of power, and has championed social justice.

British colonialists in India tended to favor the Sikhs, viewing them as more Western than the Hindus and Muslims, who made up the vast majority of the population there.

“Historically in India there has been tension between the Sikhs and the ruling elite, whether Muslim or Hindu,” said Harpreet Singh, a Sikh who is finishing a doctorate in South Asian religions at Harvard and helped found the Sikh Coalition in 2001 to help Sikhs stand up for their rights. “The gurus didn’t want to pay the non-Muslim tax. Sikhs grew in numbers and became a political force.”

Other recent acts of violence against Sikhs — the defacing in February of a temple in Michigan, the beating of a cabdriver in California in late 2010 — involved mistaken references to Al Qaeda or militant Islam. The first post-Sept. 11 killing classified as a hate crime took place in Arizona, where a Sikh was gunned down by a man who is now serving a life sentence.

In the Jackson Heights section of Queens on Monday, Sikh men in russet, black and peach-colored turbans swept leaves from the fronts of stores selling saris and gold jewelry, and offered discounts to passers-by. Many talked about the Wisconsin rampage.

“Very sad. I was shocked,” said Harbinder Singh, who works at a grocery. “We have not done any harm to anyone. Why are we targeted? Maybe some other religions have done harm. They think that we are the same. Maybe that’s the reason.”

“I’m just an ordinary man, just like other people, just like other Americans,” he said. “I should cut my hair? No one is going to change. I’m wearing the turban. I have to do it. I don’t want to say, ‘No, now I’m not going to wear my turban because of this man.’ ”

Oak Creek’s police chief, John Edwards, speaking at the news conference, identified the five men and one woman who died at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin: Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Prakash Singh, 39; Paramjit Kaur, 41; Suveg Singh, 84; and Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65, who was the center’s president.

Peter Hoyt, 53, a neighbor of Mr. Page’s in Cudahy who often stopped to chat with him during morning walks, said he was “stunned” that the man he had known could have done something so violent. Mr. Page, he said, told him that he had broken up with a girlfriend in early June.

Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Mr. Page had come to the center’s attention a decade ago because of his affiliation with rock bands known for lyrics that push far past the boundaries of tolerance.

“The music that comes from these bands is incredibly violent, and it talks about murdering Jews, black people, gay people and a whole host of other enemies,” Mr. Potok said. He added that in 2000, Mr. Page tried to buy unspecified goods from the National Alliance, which Mr. Potok described as a neo-Nazi organization that at the time was one of the country’s best organized and best financed hate groups.

But Mr. Potok said the center had not passed any information about Mr. Page to law enforcement.

“We were not looking at this guy as anything special until today,” he said. “He was one of thousands. We were just keeping an eye on him.”

Although little known among music fans, a steady subculture of racist and anti-Semitic rock bands has existed on the margins of punk and heavy metal in Europe and the United States since at least the 1970s. Hate groups sometimes use some of the bands and their record labels for fund-raising and recruiting, according to the law center and the Anti-Defamation League.

In an interview posted on the Web site of the record company Label56, Mr. Page mentioned going to Hammerfest, an annual white-supremacist festival well known to civil rights advocates. He also said he played in various neo-Nazi bands, including Blue Eyed Devils, whose song “White Victory” includes the lines: “Now I’ll fight for my race and nation/Sieg Heil!” The company removed the interview from its site on Monday.

Analysts for the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security routinely monitor violent extremist Web sites of all kinds, including those attracting white supremacists, according to former officials of both agencies. But the department’s work on the topic has been criticized. In 2009, conservatives in Congress strongly objected to a department report titled “Rightwing Extremism,” which speculated that the recession and the election of a black president could increase the threat from white supremacists.

Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary, withdrew the report and apologized for what she called its flaws. Daryl Johnson, the homeland security analyst who was the primary author of the report, said last year that after the flap, the number of analysts assigned to track non-Islamic militancy had been reduced sharply. Homeland Security Department officials denied his assertion and said the department monitored violent extremism of every kind, without regard to its religious or political bent.

J. M. Berger, an author and analyst on counterterrorism who runs the Intelwire Web site, said Mr. Page “clearly had a history with the white supremacist movement.” A song called “Welcome to the South” by Definite Hate, another band that Mr. Page played in and that Mr. Berger found online, refers to “our race war” and asks, “What has happened to America/That was once so white and free?” Mr. Berger said the lyrics and album art of Definite Hate echo the views and vocabulary of the Hammerskins, or Hammerskin Nation, a white supremacist group founded in Dallas in 1988.

According to the SITE Monitoring Service, which follows white supremacist trends, Mr. Page had an extensive presence on Hammerskin and other white nationalist Web sites, including Stormfront, where he favored the names of his bands as user names and “frequently included white supremacist symbolism” in his postings. He concluded one posting with “88,” a number frequently used by neo-Nazis and skinheads to mean “Heil, Hitler,” according to SITE. (H is the eighth letter of the alphabet.) He also used “14,” the number of words in the rallying slogan of the white supremacist movement.

Although Mr. Hoyt, his neighbor, said Mr. Page had claimed that he enlisted in the Army after Sept. 11, Army records show that he separated from the military in 1998, completing his basic training at Fort Sill in Oklahoma and serving at Fort Bliss in El Paso and Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Listed as a psychological operations specialist, he was never deployed overseas, according to the records, although Mr. Hoyt said he had talked about combat.

“He said, ‘You go there, and one minute you’re with your buddies and the next minute you’re dead,’ ” Mr. Hoyt recalled.

A source familiar with Mr. Page’s military history, who had not been authorized to speak about the case, said Mr. Page had received an “other than honorable” discharge from the Army. Pentagon officials said Mr. Page had also been demoted, from sergeant to specialist, before leaving the service.

In June 1994, while he was at Fort Bliss, the El Paso police arrested Mr. Page and charged him with criminal mischief. He was intoxicated and playing pool at a bar called the Attic when he “began kicking large holes in the Sheetrock wall with his boots,” said Renee Railey, a spokeswoman for the El Paso County district attorney.

Mr. Page pleaded guilty to the charge, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, though he was allowed to fulfill the sentence through 180 days of probation. He paid $645 in fines and court costs, and was ordered to complete 24 hours of community service.

After leaving the Army, Mr. Page, a native of Colorado, lived for several years in North Carolina, where he owned a property that Wells Fargo foreclosed on in January. In a statement, the bank said that it had no dealings with Mr. Page other than routine notifications, and that the property was vacant when the foreclosure process began last August.

Mr. Page’s former stepmother, Laura Page, 67, who divorced his father more than a decade ago, said that growing up, he was “a precious little boy, a very mellow and soft-spoken person.”

“Wade, his father and me would go camping and fishing in Colorado and have just a wonderful time, and we would play games at home, like cards and Monopoly,” Ms. Page said. “We just did the normal things that a family does.”

For most of his childhood, Ms. Page said, Mr. Page lived in the Denver area with his mother, a dog groomer, but she died when he was 13 or 14, and “he took it very hard.” He was not close to his father, she said, and moved in with a grandmother and an aunt who were also in Colorado. He enlisted in the military after graduating from high school.

“I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine what made him do this,” Ms. Page said.

1. Do you want to get along with your roommate? The uncomfortable roommate has to want to co-habitate, otherwise it’s not going to work.

The stepfather, Mr. Ebens, was convicted of violating Mr. Chin’s civil rights and sentenced to 25 years in prison, but the conviction was overturned on appeal.

The Chin case showed the power of the saying “You all look the same.” An assimilated son of Chinese immigrants somehow came to be identified with Japanese automakers. (That Asian-Americans made up much of the engineering force at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler seems not to have occurred to the attackers.)

“Asian-Americans” — a term that many Asian-Americans themselves do not use — are, of course, more a demographic category than a community arising from shared language, religion, history or culture. Yet for all our diversity, we share an experience of otherness. The fifth-generation Japanese-American from California, the Hmong refugee in Wisconsin, the Indian engineer in Texas, the Korean adoptee in Chicago and the Pakistani taxi driver in New York — all have at times been made to feel alien, sometimes immutably so.

On Tuesday, a Pew Research Center study, “The Rise of Asian-Americans,” reported that Asians overtook Hispanics in 2009 as the country’s fastest-growing ethnic group and now represent 5.8 percent of the population. It reported that Asian-Americans, on the whole, have higher incomes and better educations than whites, blacks or Latinos.

Though the study noted that discrimination, poverty and language barriers still confront refugees, undocumented immigrants and other vulnerable groups, Asian-American advocates for social justice winced. Despite decades of debunking by social scientists and historians, the model minority myth — Asian-Americans as overachieving nerds — persists. The study was based on a rigorous survey, though relying on self-reported attitudes and behaviors is not a fireproof methodology.

But the more important criticism is this: When it comes to race, nuance matters. The Pew findings encourage us to consider how positive attitudes may contribute to socioeconomic success. But history also teaches us that before Asian-Americans were seen as model minorities, we were also perpetual foreigners. Taken together, these perceptions can lead to resentment. And resentment can lead to hate.

Vincent Chin has lived longer in memory than reality. Today China, not Japan, is on the rise. Another recession has come to an uneasy close. Detroit limps along. Asian-Americans, through increasing civic participation, have asserted themselves as members of the body politic and reached some of the highest offices in government, academia and business.

Asian-Americans who have achieved success owe a debt to the agitators who followed the Chin case, often defying their own cultural backgrounds as well as the stereotype of passivity and quiescence. Everyone who cares about the promise of our increasingly diverse nation ought to see in this case the possibility of social change arising from tragic violence.",nytimes.com,True

It was about as much time as Mr. Ravi had spent at Rutgers, where he had just begun his freshman year when he set up a webcam to spy on his roommate, Tyler Clementi, who had asked to have their shared room to himself so he could invite a date over. Mr. Clementi killed himself a few days later, after discovering that Mr. Ravi had encouraged others to watch the two men have sex, using a video chat program.

The case prompted widespread debate about how to punish hate crimes against gay men and lesbians.

Mr. Ravi, 20, walked out of the Middlesex County jail in North Brunswick, N.J., just after 8:30 a.m., accompanied by his lawyer Steven D. Altman.

A few steps out, Mr. Altman grinned and put his arm around his client’s shoulder and squeezed it. Mr. Ravi, sporting a beard grown while in custody, smiled slightly, but neither man said anything to the crowd of cameras and reporters that greeted them.

Mr. Ravi is expected to be released from the Middlesex County Adult Corrections Center in North Brunswick, N.J., on Tuesday, after serving 20 days of a 30-day jail sentence imposed in May. He earned the early release, as state statute allows, for good behavior and work credit.

Officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement said they were not allowed to remove individuals, like Mr. Ravi, who are lawful permanent residents of the United States, unless they are convicted of an aggravated felony, domestic violence, drug or weapons charges or “crimes of moral turpitude.”

“Based on a review of Mr. Ravi’s criminal record, ICE is not initiating removal proceedings at this time,” said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for the immigration and customs agency.

Prosecutors have also appealed the sentence, arguing that he deserved more time behind bars.

Mr. Ravi spied on his roommate, Tyler Clementi, three weeks into their freshman year at Rutgers in September 2010, then sent out Twitter messages reporting that he had seen Mr. Clementi “making out with a dude” and encouraging others to watch on video chat.

The parents, Joseph and Jane Clementi, said the judge had missed an opportunity to highlight the seriousness of bias crimes.

The roommate, Dharun Ravi, 20, reported to Middlesex County jail on Thursday after agreeing to give up his right to remain free while prosecutors appealed his 30-day sentence. His fellow freshman Tyler Clementi committed suicide in September 2010 by jumping off the George Washington Bridge, days after Mr. Ravi used a webcam to watch his encounter with another man.

Mr. Ravi declined the opportunity to speak at his sentencing last week, during which Judge Glenn Berman of State Superior Court scolded him for not having publicly apologized. Early this week, Mr. Ravi issued a statement in which he described his actions in 2010 as “thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish.”

Mr. Ravi’s sentencing, like the crime itself, had prompted national attention, and divided many gay rights advocates, with some arguing that 30 days was little more than a slap on the wrist, and others arguing that his conduct, while despicable, did not merit the same punishment as the kind of violent or threatening behavior typically associated with bias crimes.

Prosecutors were angered when Judge Berman declared the sentence last week and almost immediately appealed it, arguing that the convictions demanded more time behind bars.

But their memorandum before sentencing did not indicate how much time they wanted Mr. Ravi to serve, only that they did not believe he had to serve the maximum sentence of 10 years that was attached to the most serious charges, of bias intimidation.

On Wednesday, the lead prosecutor elaborated on that, telling Judge Berman that she thought a five-year sentence would have been appropriate.

The statutes governing bias crimes recommend 5 to 10 years in prison, but a 7-year sentence is the presumption, and the law allows judges to depart from those guidelines if there are mitigating factors or if they believe a heavier sentence would be an injustice.

Mr. Ravi appeared in court to tell the judge that he would report to begin serving his sentence Thursday. That sentence had been delayed pending the appeal from the prosecution, and one from the defense, which has argued that it was denied evidence, including a suicide note, that could have helped Mr. Ravi at his trial.

While Mr. Ravi was not charged with causing Mr. Clementi’s suicide, many of his defenders argued that he was essentially — and unfairly — convicted of it. Judge Berman received more than 100 letters and e-mails before sentencing, most of them arguing against a harsh punishment for Mr. Ravi. On Wednesday, he said that his in-box continued to fill up with complaints about the sentence he imposed.

The judge defended the sentence as the product of great consideration.

“It was anything but spontaneous,” he said.

Judge Berman noted that the punishment was harsher in some ways than what was recommended in a report by the correction official who did the presentencing interview with Mr. Ravi. That report recommended against any incarceration or fine.

It also recommended that Mr. Ravi perform more extensive community service, and that he tour schools to discuss his experience and bias crimes.

But the judge, who last week criticized Mr. Ravi for not once apologizing for what he had done, said he would not be an “appropriate” spokesman against bias, given that he had barely acknowledged any wrongdoing.

Mr. Ravi, 20, issued a statement late Tuesday to offer his first clear apology for his crimes, saying, “I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices.”

While last week the judge reserved his harshest words for Mr. Ravi, on Wednesday he engaged in a tense exchange with Julia McClure, the first assistant prosecutor for Middlesex County, saying he would not comment on her appeal, but accusing her of “smirking” as he explained his reasoning for the sentencing.

Ms. McClure argued that there were no mitigating factors against a harsher sentence for Mr. Ravi; the judge said if that were the case, then she should be recommending the standard seven years, not five.

In reaching his sentence, Judge Berman said he started with the agreement the prosecution had made with Molly Wei, who had viewed the webcam with Mr. Ravi the first night he spied on Mr. Clementi and his visitor.

Ms. Wei was spared prosecution in an agreement to testify against Mr. Ravi, agreeing to three years’ probation and 300 hours of community service.

Believing that “consistency breeds fairness,” the judge said he gave Mr. Ravi community service and probation. “It wasn’t my deal,” he said. “It was the state’s.”

But because Mr. Ravi’s “involvement was more extensive,” he said, he had added to the sentence, ordering Mr. Ravi to undergo counseling in “alternate lifestyles.”

That phrase had angered gay rights advocates who believe it is derogatory; the judge said he took the language from the plea bargains the prosecution offered Mr. Ravi before he went to trial.

In addition, the judge said, because Mr. Ravi had been convicted of tampering with a witness (trying to get Ms. Wei to lie to the police) and with evidence (trying to cover up his Twitter and text messages), he sentenced him to 30 days in jail.

Under state law, Mr. Ravi could serve as little as 20 days, if he earns work credits and rewards for good behavior in jail.

The judge said he had relied on the statute’s recommendation in imposing the fine, and set it at an amount he considered “affordable, impactful and proportionate.”

Over all, Judge Berman said the sentence “was fair, it was appropriate, and most of all, it was consistent.”

He argued that the Legislature intended prison terms to be attached to bias crimes that were “assaultive or violent in nature,” not invasion of privacy.

“I also know his age,” Judge Berman added, calling it a mitigating factor.

“I believe justice compels me to deviate from the guidelines,” he said.

However, Judge Berman also said, “I admit that people can disagree with me.”

The hearing here in State Superior Court in Middlesex County lasted little more than a half-hour, and Mr. Clementi’s parents, who had sat through every day of the trial, and sentencing, were not in court.

Prosecutors were angered when Judge Berman declared the sentence last week and almost immediately appealed it, arguing that the convictions demanded more time behind bars.

But their memorandum before sentencing did not indicate how much time they wanted Mr. Ravi to serve, only that they did not believe he had to serve the maximum sentence of 10 years that was attached to the most serious charges, of bias intimidation.

On Wednesday, the lead prosecutor elaborated on that, telling Judge Berman that she thought a five-year sentence would have been appropriate.

The statutes governing bias crimes recommend 5 to 10 years in prison, but a 7-year sentence is the presumption, and the law allows judges to depart from those guidelines if there are mitigating factors or if they believe a heavier sentence would be an injustice.

Mr. Ravi appeared in court to tell the judge that he would report to begin serving his sentence Thursday. That sentence had been delayed pending the appeal from the prosecution, and one from the defense, which has argued that it was denied evidence, including a suicide note, that could have helped Mr. Ravi at his trial.

While Mr. Ravi was not charged with causing Mr. Clementi’s suicide, many of his defenders argued that he was essentially — and unfairly — convicted of it. Judge Berman received more than 100 letters and e-mails before sentencing, most of them arguing against a harsh punishment for Mr. Ravi. On Wednesday, he said that his in-box continued to fill up with complaints about the sentence he imposed.

The judge defended the sentence as the product of great consideration.

“It was anything but spontaneous,” he said.

Judge Berman noted that the punishment was harsher in some ways than what was recommended in a report by the correction official who did the presentencing interview with Mr. Ravi. That report recommended against any incarceration or fine.

It also recommended that Mr. Ravi perform more extensive community service, and that he tour schools to discuss his experience and bias crimes.

But the judge, who last week criticized Mr. Ravi for not once apologizing for what he had done, said he would not be an “appropriate” spokesman against bias, given that he had barely acknowledged any wrongdoing.

Mr. Ravi, 20, issued a statement late Tuesday to offer his first clear apology for his crimes, saying, “I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices.”

While last week the judge reserved his harshest words for Mr. Ravi, on Wednesday he engaged in a tense exchange with Julia McClure, the first assistant prosecutor for Middlesex County, saying he would not comment on her appeal, but accusing her of “smirking” as he explained his reasoning for the sentencing.

Ms. McClure argued that there were no mitigating factors against a harsher sentence for Mr. Ravi; the judge said if that were the case, then she should be recommending the standard seven years, not five.

In reaching his sentence, Judge Berman said he started with the agreement the prosecution had made with Molly Wei, who had viewed the webcam with Mr. Ravi the first night he spied on Mr. Clementi and his visitor.

Ms. Wei was spared prosecution in an agreement to testify against Mr. Ravi, agreeing to three years’ probation and 300 hours of community service.

Believing that “consistency breeds fairness,” the judge said he gave Mr. Ravi community service and probation. “It wasn’t my deal,” he said. “It was the state’s.”

But because Mr. Ravi’s “involvement was more extensive,” he said, he had added to the sentence, ordering Mr. Ravi to undergo counseling in “alternate lifestyles.”

That phrase had angered gay rights advocates who believe it is derogatory; the judge said he took the language from the plea bargains the prosecution offered Mr. Ravi before he went to trial.

In addition, the judge said, because Mr. Ravi had been convicted of tampering with a witness (trying to get Ms. Wei to lie to the police) and with evidence (trying to cover up his Twitter and text messages), he sentenced him to 30 days in jail.

Under state law, Mr. Ravi could serve as little as 20 days, if he earns work credits and rewards for good behavior in jail.

The judge said he had relied on the statute’s recommendation in imposing the fine, and set it at an amount he considered “affordable, impactful and proportionate.”

Over all, Judge Berman said the sentence “was fair, it was appropriate, and most of all, it was consistent.”

He argued that the Legislature intended prison terms to be attached to bias crimes that were “assaultive or violent in nature,” not invasion of privacy.

“I also know his age,” Judge Berman added, calling it a mitigating factor.

“I believe justice compels me to deviate from the guidelines,” he said.

However, Judge Berman also said, “I admit that people can disagree with me.”

The hearing here in State Superior Court in Middlesex County lasted little more than a half-hour, and Mr. Clementi’s parents, who had sat through every day of the trial, and sentencing, were not in court.

The family has declined to comment on the sentence, saying through a representative that they are deferring while the prosecution presses the appeal.

In March, a jury convicted Mr. Ravi of all 15 criminal counts with which he had been charged, including invasion of privacy and bias intimidation. On two of the intimidation counts, he faced up to 10 years in state prison.

Last week, a judge sentenced him to 30 days in jail, beginning on Thursday. Prosecutors said they would appeal the sentence as being too lenient.

Mr. Ravi’s lawyers have said that they expect to appeal the convictions and that authorities charged him with such serious crimes because of the suicide of Mr. Clementi, 18, even though he was not charged with the death.

Mr. Ravi could have remained free during the appeal but instead volunteered to head to the Middlesex County jail in New Brunswick. “It’s the only way I can go on with my life,” he said.

Mr. Ravi was chastised at his sentencing May 21 by Judge Glenn Berman for not apologizing for his actions.

Officials in Superior Court in Middlesex County, where Mr. Ravi was sentenced on Monday after being convicted of using a webcam to spy on his roommate having sex with another man, say he will not begin to serve any sentence until the appeals court has ruled.

Mr. Ravi’s lawyers have also promised an appeal of his conviction, arguing in court that he was wrongly charged and that they should have been allowed to see more evidence, including a suicide note that his roommate, Tyler Clementi, 18, left before he jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge in September 2010, a few days after he discovered that Mr. Ravi had spied on him in their room at Rutgers University.

Judge Berman declined to comment on Tuesday. But his friends, former clerks and lawyers who have argued alongside him and before him say he would not have arrived lightly at his decision.

The defense and the prosecution agreed on the facts of the case, which were established by an extensive electronic trail of surveillance cameras, Twitter feeds and text messages.

Even on Monday, as they presented their final arguments to the judge before sentencing, the two sides remained unbudged in their corners.

Judge Berman keeps a dictionary on his desk among the collection of gavels in his office — his father, who owned a clothing manufacturing business, taught him to read with a dictionary always at hand. In his remarks at sentencing, he drew a distinction between “hate” and “bias.”

He did not believe Mr. Ravi hated Tyler Clementi, he said, “but I do believe he acted out of colossal insensitivity.”

He has told friends that he read every letter sent to him before the Ravi sentencing — the stack, which he held up in court, was at least two inches thick. And he was acutely aware of the pain of both families, particularly the Clementis. He has two children, a son about the age Mr. Clementi was when he killed himself, and a daughter in her mid-20s. They moved to California after he and his wife divorced, but he speaks to them every day, friends said.

His ruling that Mr. Ravi, as part of his counseling, would get education in what he called “alternate lifestyles” prompted complaints among gay people, for suggesting that being gay is something done by choice, like playing golf or living in a nudist colony. But those who know Judge Berman say that he is not biased.

“When I worked for him, it was in family court, and he was never prejudiced in one way or another about gender or anything else,” said Rebecka Whitmarsh, a former clerk. “He based his decision solely on what came before him, the law itself.”

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/opinion/the-rutgers-webcam-spying-case.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"The 30-day jail sentence Dharun Ravi received in the Rutgers spying case will be debated for years, but it is far more just than the 10 years he could have received after being convicted of invasion of privacy, witness tampering and multiple counts of a hate crime called bias intimidation. The jury found that Mr. Ravi knew his conduct could make Tyler Clementi, his roommate, feel targeted because he was gay.

Mr. Ravi’s spying on Mr. Clementi in a sexual encounter with another man was abhorrent. His actions showed “colossal insensitivity,” Judge Glenn Berman said. But the judge told the courtroom, “I do not believe he hated Tyler Clementi.”

Mr. Clementi’s suicide, two days after learning that Mr. Ravi had spied on him, has made this case especially difficult at every stage, including sentencing. But Mr. Ravi, who dropped out of Rutgers, was not charged with causing Mr. Clementi’s death, and Judge Berman’s job was to impose punishment that fit the crime. In New Jersey, the cases involving bias-intimidation crimes that have carried long sentences have generally involved violence — for example, where a defendant physically assaults someone while using a racial slur. As the judge said at sentencing, Mr. Ravi’s wrongdoing didn’t involve violent crimes for which the Legislature intended substantial prison time.

Mr. Ravi’s sentence also includes three years of probation, 300 hours of community service, counseling about cyberbullying and “alternate lifestyles,” and about $11,000 in fees, largely to help victims of bias crimes. The judge said that he would recommend against deporting Mr. Ravi, a legal resident, to India.

Mr. Ravi’s lamentable decision not to speak at the sentencing hearing added to the tragedy’s haunting force. “I heard this jury say guilty 288 times — 24 questions, 12 jurors, that’s the multiplication,” Judge Berman said. “And I haven’t heard you apologize once.” Mr. Ravi should rectify his failure to show remorse for harm he caused to Mr. Clementi’s “heart and mind,” as Mr. Clementi’s brother put it.

Mr. Ravi’s lawyers have said they will appeal his conviction; the prosecutor said he would appeal the 30-day sentence, which he called “insufficient.” However the case unfolds, it is up to Mr. Ravi to take responsibility for his actions and demonstrate he is worthy of the justice he received from Judge Berman.",nytimes.com,True

“I do not believe he hated Tyler Clementi,” the judge told a courtroom packed on one side with supporters of Mr. Ravi and on the other with those of the Clementi family. “I do believe he acted out of colossal insensitivity.”

Prosecutors and Mr. Clementi’s family, who had addressed reporters with relief bordering on buoyancy following the verdict two months ago, canceled a news conference planned for after the sentencing.

Mr. Ravi, 20, was not charged with causing Mr. Clementi’s death, but the suicide hung heavily over the trial, and over the sentencing on Monday. Mr. Clementi’s mother, father and brother spoke before the judge delivered his decision, breaking down occasionally as they recalled his accomplishment and his promise, and the pain of losing him and of reliving the agony of his final days as they endured three weeks of courtroom testimony.

“I cannot imagine the level of rejection, isolation and disdain he must have felt from his peers,” Tyler’s brother James Clementi said. “Dharun never bothered to care about the harm he was doing to my brother’s heart and mind. My family has never heard an apology, an acknowledgment of any wrongdoing.”

His mother, Jane Clementi, also criticized students who knew about the spying from Mr. Ravi’s Twitter feeds. “How could they all go along with such meanness?” she said. “Why didn’t any one of them speak up and try to stop it?”

Judge Berman said he wanted to impose a sentence that was “constructive” and would provide a measure of closure — “though I don’t know how the Clementis will ever get closure,” he said. He said he imposed the jail time for witness and evidence tampering and for lying to the police. But for the bias intimidation convictions, he gave Mr. Ravi three years’ probation.

The judge did not explicitly say why he deviated so far from the maximum sentence. But he said he believed the State Legislature had intended prison time to be attached to crimes of violence, and there had been none.

Mr. Ravi’s lead lawyer, Steven Altman, had earlier read from a presentencing memo by a corrections officer who had interviewed Mr. Ravi and recommended against incarceration.

Judge Berman also sentenced Mr. Ravi to 300 hours of community service, counseling about cyberbullying and what he called “alternate lifestyles,” and approximately $11,000 in fees. Most of the money is to be used to help victims of bias crimes.

Mr. Clementi, an 18-year-old who had recently come out to his parents, and Mr. Ravi were three weeks into their freshman year at Rutgers when Mr. Clementi asked if he could have the room for the evening so he could be alone with a man, whom he had met on a Web site for gay men.

In court, prosecutors presented a long trail of electronic evidence to show how Mr. Ravi had set up a webcam to spy on the men, then gone into a friend’s room and watched. He caught only a glimpse of Mr. Clementi and his visitor in an embrace, then sent out Twitter messages announcing that he had seen his roommate “making out with a dude.” He set up the camera again two days later and urged others to watch. But by then, Mr. Clementi had seen the Twitter posts and turned off the webcam.

Many gay rights advocates had hailed the jury’s verdict as a bold strike against bias, a message that bullying of gay men and lesbians should not be dismissed as a mere prank.

But other prominent gay commentators argued that while what Mr. Ravi did was repugnant, it was not the kind of sustained or aggressive behavior that constitutes bullying.

The sentence similarly divided them.

Steven Goldstein, the chairman of Garden State Equality, a New Jersey gay rights group that pushed for the state to pass its strict antibullying statutes after Mr. Clementi’s death, said the sentence was lighter than what many shoplifters received.

“We have opposed throwing the book at Dharun Ravi,” Mr. Goldstein said in a statement. “But we have similarly rejected the other extreme, that Ravi should have gotten no jail time at all, and today’s sentencing is closer to that extreme than the other.”

William Dobbs, who had attended rallies supporting Mr. Ravi, said the judge was reflecting the discomfort many gay rights campaigners expressed at the use of hate crimes to prosecute Mr. Ravi.

“The judge had to control a backlash to an out-of-control prosecution,” he said. “The number of charges, the severity and the potential penalties, even the amount of resources devoted to this trial, was out of all proportion to the incident.”

Bruce J. Kaplan, the Middlesex County prosecutor, issued a statement after the sentencing, saying that while his office had not requested the maximum prison term, “it was expected that his conviction on multiple offenses of invading the privacy of two victims on two separate occasions, four counts of bias intimidation against Tyler Clementi, and the cover-up of those crimes would warrant more than a 30-day jail term.”

Still, even some jurors continued to struggle over the appropriate sentence. One, Susan Matiejunas, said she had watched the proceedings on television all morning and was surprised.

“Thirty days is a slap on the wrist,” she said. “Six months to a year would have been more suitable, since we convicted him on so many counts.”

Ms. Matiejunas telephoned later to say she had reconsidered.

“I do not believe he hated Tyler Clementi,” the judge told a courtroom packed on one side with supporters of Mr. Ravi and on the other with those of the Clementi family. “I do believe he acted out of colossal insensitivity.”

Prosecutors and Mr. Clementi’s family, who had addressed reporters with relief bordering on buoyancy following the verdict two months ago, canceled a news conference planned for after the sentencing. Mr. Ravi’s family collapsed into an embrace with his lawyers. Just moments earlier, his mother, Sabitha Ravi, had sobbed while imploring the judge to spare her son prison time.

“The media misconstrued the facts to the public and misconceptions were formed,” she said, telling how she watched helplessly as her son sank into despair after he was charged and dropped out of Rutgers, barely eating or leaving the house. “All I could do was hug him and cry.”

At her tears, Mr. Ravi himself broke down crying, the first time since the beginning of the trial that he had publicly shown more than a glimpse of emotion.

Mr. Ravi, 20, was not charged with causing Mr. Clementi’s death, but the suicide hung heavily over the trial, and over the sentencing on Monday. Mr. Clementi’s mother, father and brother spoke before the judge delivered his decision, breaking down occasionally as they recalled his accomplishment and his promise, and the pain of losing him and of reliving the agony of his final days as they endured three weeks of courtroom testimony.

“I cannot imagine the level of rejection, isolation and disdain he must have felt from his peers,” Tyler’s brother James Clementi said. “Dharun never bothered to care about the harm he was doing to my brother’s heart and mind. My family has never heard an apology, an acknowledgment of any wrongdoing.”

His mother, Jane Clementi, also criticized students who knew about the spying from Mr. Ravi’s Twitter feeds. “How could they all go along with such meanness?” she said. “Why didn’t any one of them speak up and try to stop it?”

Judge Berman said he wanted to impose a sentence that was “constructive” and would provide a measure of closure — “though I don’t know how the Clementis will ever get closure,” he said. He said he imposed the jail time for witness and evidence tampering and for lying to the police. But for the bias intimidation convictions, he gave Mr. Ravi three years’ probation.

The judge did not explicitly say why he deviated so far from the maximum sentence. But he said he believed the State Legislature had intended prison time to be attached to crimes of violence, and there had been none.

Mr. Ravi’s lead lawyer, Steven Altman, had earlier read from a presentencing memo by a corrections officer who had interviewed Mr. Ravi and recommended against incarceration.

Mr. Ravi, who came to this country from India as a child, remains a felon and could face deportation. But the judge said he would recommend against that.

Gillian M. Christensen, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the agency was “in the process of reviewing documents relating to the conviction and sentencing” of Mr. Ravi, but would not comment further.

Some immigration lawyers pointed on Monday to a clause declaring that a legal resident, or green card holder, like Mr. Ravi can be deported if convicted of two or more crimes involving “moral turpitude,” as long as neither crime arose out of a single scheme.

Thomas E. Moseley, an immigration lawyer based in Newark, said that if the immigration authorities “wanted to be really aggressive,” they might argue that the tampering crime was separate from the bias crime.

Judge Berman also sentenced Mr. Ravi to 300 hours of community service, counseling about cyberbullying and what he called “alternate lifestyles,” and approximately $11,000 in fees. Most of the money is to be used to help victims of bias crimes.

Mr. Clementi, an 18-year-old who had recently come out to his parents, and Mr. Ravi were three weeks into their freshman year at Rutgers when Mr. Clementi asked if he could have the room for the evening so he could be alone with a man, whom he had met on a Web site for gay men.

In court, prosecutors presented a long trail of electronic evidence to show how Mr. Ravi had set up a webcam to spy on the men, then gone into a friend’s room and watched. He caught only a glimpse of Mr. Clementi and his visitor in an embrace, then sent out Twitter messages announcing that he had seen his roommate “making out with a dude.” He set up the camera again two days later and urged others to watch. But by then, Mr. Clementi had seen the Twitter posts and turned off the webcam.

In an op-ed article in The Star-Ledger of Newark last month, Jim McGreevey, who resigned as New Jersey’s governor after declaring himself “a gay American,” argued that Mr. Ravi’s conviction “showed how far we have traveled from the hateful, homophobic past.”

“The criminal justice system worked, this time for a gay victim,” Mr. McGreevey wrote. “But there was something disquieting about the prospect of retributive punishment being meted out on behalf of a gay young man.”

Mr. McGreevey, who now counsels prisoners, argued that jail time would neither rehabilitate nor send a message. “Perhaps the long trail of gay history inevitably leads to this call for punishment,” he wrote, “but it need not.”

The discussion itself is causing some gay rights advocates discomfort. Richard Kim, the executive editor of The Nation online, who wrote after Mr. Clementi’s suicide about his own experience growing up gay in New Jersey, said he was wary that expressing opposition to a prison sentence would make him appear to link hands with those who accuse gay men and lesbians of seeking “special treatment” with laws against bullying.

“That’s not my argument,” Mr. Kim said. Still, he added, he does not think the verdict against Mr. Ravi was justified, and he does not think he should serve jail time.

“I haven’t seen anything to convince me it has any deterrent effect,” he said.

Mr. Ravi set up a webcam to spy on Mr. Clementi three weeks into their freshman year at Rutgers University, after Mr. Clementi asked to have the room alone so he could be with a man he had recently met on a Web site for gay men.

Mr. Clementi’s suicide three days later prompted an outcry from celebrities and politicians, and pushed New Jersey to pass one of the nation’s strictest anti-bullying laws.

In court, prosecutors used an extensive electronic record to show how Mr. Ravi, 20, had sent Twitter and text messages declaring that he had seen his roommate “making out with a dude,” and encouraging others to watch. The jury convicted Mr. Ravi on all 15 counts, including invasion of privacy, hate crimes and tampering with evidence after he tried to cover up his Twitter trail.

Dan Savage, a gay columnist whose video campaign, “It Gets Better,” began in response to other suicides of gay teenagers just before Mr. Clementi, 18, jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge, argued that simply locking up Mr. Ravi was a lost opportunity to talk about the other institutions and people “complicit” in Mr. Clementi’s death.

“What was he told about being gay growing up, by his faith leaders, by the media, by the culture?” Mr. Savage said. “Ravi may have been the last person who made him feel unsafe and abused and worthless, but he couldn’t have been the first.

In an essay, J. Bryan Lowder, a columnist at Slate, urged against a prison sentence: “Unfortunately, we can’t lock the bully up, because the bully is in all of us.”

Mr. Lowder, 24, argued that Mr. Ravi’s remarks had to be viewed in the context of being a teenager in a culture where low-level homophobia is pervasive — whether it is high school students dismissing things not vaguely homosexual as “so gay,” or Mr. Ravi’s texts suggesting that gay men were at least a bit icky.

“It’s not to say that those things don’t hurt and those things are fine,” Mr. Lowder said in an interview. “But to pin the whole weight of our culture of homophobia on Ravi and to think that sending him a message is going to fix all that is misguided.”

He suggested that Mr. Ravi be sentenced to speaking about the outsize effects that small words can have.

In a memo this month, the prosecutor, Julia McClure, urged that Mr. Ravi be imprisoned as a deterrent to antigay bias. She “adamantly disputed” that his was the exceptional case that should make the judge deviate from awarding him the 5- to 10-year prison sentence associated with the charges.

In the memo, Ms. McClure quoted a text message, not introduced in court, that Mr. Ravi had sent to a friend the day after Mr. Clementi killed himself, arguing that it showed a lack of remorse. Mr. Ravi, who had by then left Rutgers, asked, “How can I convince my mom to let me go back Friday night and get drunk?”

Mr. Ravi rejected two plea deals that would have included what his supporters are arguing for now: community service, probation and no jail time.

Ms. McClure said she would not push for the maximum prison sentence. But she urged the judge, Glenn Berman, to ignore pleas from pundits.

“Those opinions are largely, if not entirely, uninformed and discredit the intelligence and commitment of the citizens who were selected to serve on the jury panel,” she wrote.

Suzanne B. Goldberg, a law professor at Columbia, said the sentence had to match what others would get.

“Most 20-year-olds who commit serious crimes don’t get community service,” she said.

Ms. Goldberg compared Mr. Ravi’s case to that of a teenager who kills someone while sending text messages and driving. “It shows the same disregard of human life and human dignity that stems in part from immaturity,” she said. “The texters are not texting with the intent of causing someone’s death, but if they cause injury or death, they are held accountable. To have them just engage in a public-service campaign against texting while driving is not what we do in our current system.”

Mr. Ravi could face deportation to his native India if he is given a prison sentence. Many Indians have been among his biggest supporters. At a rally on the State House steps in Trenton last week, some waved signs with the headline on Mr. McGreevey’s article: “Don’t Make Dharun Ravi Our Antigay Scapegoat.”

Peter Frycki, the publisher of Out in Jersey, a magazine for gay people, said his readers had been split, with about two-thirds saying they believed that the jury had done the right thing, and one-third disagreeing. But many, he said, are arguing that Mr. Ravi should be forced to do community service against bullying, rather than serve jail time.

Numbers released by the Interior Ministry on Friday showed an 11.2 percent overall increase to 30,216 of crimes carried out for political or ideological reasons across the country. More than 70 percent of the crimes involved groups on the extreme left or extreme right, and many were acts of vandalism during regional elections in several states last year.

While the circulation of illegal propaganda, which includes all printed material associated with the Nazis, remained the most common politically motivated crime, the number of racially motivated attacks grew by more than 16 percent.

The two men were each charged with three counts of first-degree murder, two counts of shooting with intent to kill and five counts of malicious harassment, the equivalent of hate crimes under state law.

The shootings unfolded the day after Mr. England used a racial slur on Facebook to describe the man he believed had killed his father, Carl, in April 2010. Prosecutors declined to file homicide charges against the man who was a person of interest in the case, Pernell Jefferson. They determined that Mr. Jefferson, who is black, was justified using deadly force in self-defense under Oklahoma law.

In a statement on Friday, Doug Drummond, the first assistant district attorney for Tulsa County, said he would not comment about the specific evidence for any of the charges against Mr. England and Mr. Watts, both of whom the police said had confessed after their arrest on Sunday.

“Filing charges is the first step to obtain justice for the victims and their families,” Mr. Drummond said. “This is a tragic and senseless crime. Our office is committed to holding those responsible accountable for their actions.”

The potential punishment on each first-degree murder charge is life with parole, life without parole or the death penalty. Mr. Drummond said the decision whether to seek the death penalty against the two men would be determined later.

The charges were announced the day of the first funeral, for Mr. Clark. At a chapel not far from the scenes of the shootings, Mr. Clark’s brothers and relatives and several black leaders and Tulsa officials, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Mayor Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., gathered before his coffin to sing and pray.

In his remarks to mourners and in an interview after the service, Mr. Jackson likened Mr. Clark’s death to those of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old who was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida, and Emmett Till, the 14-year-old whose murder in Mississippi in 1955 was a catalyst of the civil rights movement.

“Emmett Till was not famous,” Mr. Jackson said outside the Crown Hill Chapel. “Trayvon Martin was not famous. And yet it is the power of the blood of the innocent that often is redeeming to us all.”

Mr. Clark — who was the son of a school bus driver and who grew up in the Seminole Hills public-housing complex — walked around the city with his auburn-colored acoustic guitar slung across his back, and he would often play for friends at the downtown Tulsa homeless shelter where he once stayed, the Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless. He was unemployed, and had survived on his disability check.

Every Tuesday morning, he would pick up a portion of his check from the homeless center’s executive director, Sandra Lewis, whom he had known for years.

On Friday at the chapel, Ms. Lewis and Mr. Clark’s relatives and friends reminisced about him, telling stories about the Kool-Aid that he made so sweet no one else could drink it, and about his love of Jimi Hendrix riffs. There was little anger displayed for Mr. England and Mr. Watts by relatives and friends, even after word spread that the two men were being charged with hate crimes.

“Justice needs to be served,” said Donnie Clark, 56, one of Mr. Clark’s three brothers. “We didn’t know them. Maybe if they would have known us it wouldn’t have happened.”

Ms. Fields’s funeral is Saturday. Services for Mr. Allen, 31, a native of Hattiesburg, Miss., will be Tuesday.

Ms. Fields did not know Mr. Clark, but members of their families knew one another: one of Mr. Clark’s brothers was friends with one of Ms. Fields’s brothers, Kenneth Fields.

Ms. Fields was known as Donna because people had trouble pronouncing her first name, Dannaer, which sounds like Danner. She was an active member of Rentie Grove Baptist Church, and after becoming seriously ill a few years ago, she stopped abusing drugs and alcohol, turning more than ever to her faith, those close to her said.

“You can look at the facts of the case and certainly come up with what would appear to be a logical theory, but we’re going to let the evidence take us where we want to go,” said the Tulsa police chief, Chuck Jordan.

In Tulsa — a city of 392,000, about 62,000 of whom are black — the shootings shocked, frightened and angered many black residents on Easter weekend and prompted an intense manhunt. The authorities formed a task force called Operation Random Shooter, made up of more than two dozen local, state and federal investigators from the Tulsa Police Department, the Tulsa County Sheriff’s Office and the federal Marshals Service. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also joined the investigation.

Jack Henderson, a city councilman who is black and whose district includes all of the shooting sites, said that before the arrests, many in the area were terrified.

“A lot of people in my community have been calling me, afraid that they couldn’t go outside, didn’t know if they could even go to church, didn’t know if they could go to the grocery store,” Mr. Henderson said at the news conference.

“With these two people off the streets, people in my community as well as the rest of this city can feel that they are safer,” he said.

Tulsa officials said the shootings were unlike anything the city had ever seen in its modern history. None of the victims knew one another, and all of them were shot within a few miles. Mr. Henderson said he had heard from constituents that in one of the shootings, the suspects had approached their victims at random and asked for directions. “When they turned around to walk away, they just opened fire,” Mr. Henderson said.

In 1921, Tulsa was the scene of a riot that is one of the deadliest episodes of racial violence in the nation’s history, in which a mob of white Tulsans destroyed a black neighborhood and killed dozens, perhaps hundreds, of black residents.

After the Friday shootings, city leaders said that the anger in the black community had reached the point where people were talking about taking the law into their own hands. Asked on Sunday if he feared any sort of uprising, Chief Jordan replied: “I have much more faith in my fellow Tulsans than that. I think they let us do our job.”

Chief Jordan released few details about many aspects of the shootings, saying the investigation was continuing. He declined to say if the suspects were cooperating with investigators, and he said that Mr. England’s Facebook postings would be part of the prosecution of the case.

Mr. England, a stocky young man with a mohawk-style haircut, graduated in 2009 from Sperry High School. Late on Friday evening, hours after the first shooting, Mr. England suggested on his Facebook page that he was contemplating suicide because people were accusing him of unspecified acts that “I didn’t do,” he wrote, adding that it might be time to “call it quits.”

In the series of comments that followed, his friends tried to comfort him, with some writing that they loved him. Others appealed to him to remember his sister, Cady, and his infant son, Jacob C. England II. “Please dont do anything stupid jake,” one friend responded. “Think about cady and the baby and everyone that loves you.” It was unclear if Ms. Wilde was the mother of his son or where the baby was living.

It was Fatima’s impassioned plea before a local news camera several days after the attack that helped draw international media attention to Ms. Alawadi’s killing. She told a local television station about finding her mother with a note nearby calling her a “terrorist.”

“You took my mother away from me,” Fatima said. “You took my best friend away from me. Why?”

In November, according to the affidavit, El Cajon police officers responded to a call about two people in a parked car, and found Fatima with a 21-year-old man. Ms. Alawadi picked Fatima up from the scene, but as they drove away, Fatima said, “I love you, Mom,” opened the car door, and jumped out while the vehicle was moving about 35 miles per hour, the affidavit said.

At the hospital, where she was brought with minor injuries, Fatima refused to talk to the police. But the paramedics told them Fatima had said she jumped because she was being forced to marry her cousin against her will.

In addition, the affidavit states that on the day of her mother’s death, while Fatima was being interviewed by the police, a text message was sent from her phone to an unknown correspondent that read, “The detective will find out tell them cnt talk.”

Esmah Alawadi, who lives in Texas with her husband, disputes a number of the family details that were revealed in the affidavit.

Anyone who followed the Rutgers trial closely — or read Ian Parker’s absorbing investigation of the two roommates in The New Yorker — is likely to conclude that Ravi is arrogant, mouthy and insensitive, but not a malicious homophobe. Clementi was an openly gay, socially awkward, complicated 18-year-old, who killed himself for reasons we don’t know. My reading of the case is that the jury seized on those handy bias statutes in a clumsy attempt to punish somebody for a death that remains unexplained. It’s not a great reach to say that Ravi faces up to 10 years in prison for being a jerk.

The shooting of Trayvon Martin has become a cause before it is even a case. It’s natural to admire the resolute grace of his grieving parents and to endorse their demand for answers Florida authorities have been slow to provide. It’s commendable to shine the lamp of shame on Florida’s absurdly permissive gun laws. (This, remember, is the state that tried last year to make it a crime for doctors to talk to patients about the dangers of guns in the home.) But fashioning a narrative from the hate-crimes textbook — bellowing analogies to the racist nightmares of Birmingham and Selma, as the reliably rabble-rousing Reverend Sharpton has done — is just political opportunism. This is the kind of demagoguery that could prejudice a prosecution, or mobilize a mob. Is it not creepy, by the way, that Spike Lee was tweeting the suspected home address of George Zimmerman? As if to say, “Go get him!” (Lee sent apologies and a check to the elderly couple who were scared from their home because, oops, the tweet gave the wrong address. But apparently it’s O.K. to terrorize Zimmerman.)

Many of the justifications for anti-hate laws seem to me to fall short: bias crimes terrorize more than the immediate victim; yes, but so does a mugger who frequents a particular neighborhood. We must protect the most vulnerable; fine, then why not assign extra penalties for criminals who prey on the poor, children, or — as a few prosecutors have done — the elderly? Racism and other prejudices are especially offensive motives; worse than sadism, or pedophilia?

Back in 2001, Heidi M. Hurd, a professor who comingles law and philosophy, wrote an article entitled “Why Liberals Should Hate ‘Hate Crime Legislation.’ ” The thesis sounded contrarian; hate crime laws evolved out of a great liberal cause — civil rights — and have been propelled by activists and politicians most of us would call liberal. Hurd, though she is a Democrat, was referring not to the contemporary political left but to traditional, John-Locke-and-John-Stuart-Mill liberalism, which holds that the state is licensed to temper bad behavior, not to perfect human nature. Hate crime laws, she wrote, crossed that line: “The law now regulates not only what we do, but who we are.”

There is nothing novel about the law taking into account a criminal’s state of mind; one of the prerequisites for a conviction under common law is “mens rea” — a guilty mind, malice aforethought, criminal intent. The law also recognizes gradations of guilty purpose. A premeditated killing is more punishable than one committed in the heat of the moment, which is worse than a killing that results from negligence. New York law compounds the punishment if you kill someone to prevent him from being a witness.

The distinction Hurd makes — convincingly, I think — is that when you penalize intent you are punishing matters of choice. One can choose not to pull the trigger, not to throw the rock, not to steal the purse.

“You can’t choose not to be prejudiced or biased — at least not willy-nilly, on the spot,” she told me, when I called her the other day at the University of Illinois. “We pass moral judgments all the time against bigots and chauvinists and homophobes and so forth. But this is a question not of what we should morally blame people for, but of what we should deprive them of liberty for.”

In her criminal law class, Hurd teaches the cases of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, and says that every time she confronts those monstrous crimes a part of her wonders, “Why don’t we use the power of the state to make people less evil?” But, as she points out, those were both crimes eligible for the death penalty. “What are you going to do, kill somebody twice?”

In most cases, hate crime laws take offenses that would carry more modest sentences — assault, vandalism — and ratchet up the penalty two or three times because we know, or think we know, what evil disposition lurked in the offender’s mind. Then we pat ourselves on the back. As if none of us, pure and righteous citizens, ever entertained a racist thought or laughed at a homophobic slur.

Whatever the police eventually determine, the crime has shattered the sense of security for Iraqi immigrants in El Cajon, exposing cultural tensions and distrust that have often simmered just below the surface since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.

Hanif Mohebi, director of the San Diego chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that many Muslim women in the area were worried that Ms. Alawadi had been targeted because she wore a headscarf in public, as many observant Muslim women do.

“The majority of the community that wears scarves are concerned,” Mr. Mohebi said. He cautioned against a rush to judgment before the police had finished investigating. Still, he added, “the community has gone through some hate crimes before, and the assumption the people have is that they’re going through one now.”

Two decades ago, El Cajon, just northeast of San Diego, was largely white and English-speaking. But as wars in their homelands pushed more and more Iraqis and others to emigrate, the Middle Eastern population here has exploded. El Cajon now houses one of the largest Iraqi communities in the country. Middle Eastern groceries and restaurants dot Main Street, while on the sidewalks, many families stroll by speaking in Arabic.

Ms. Alawadi and her husband moved to the United States from Saudi Arabia in 1995 after fleeing Iraq during the first gulf war. They then had five children, and for the most part, Mr. Alhimidi said, their neighbors here made them feel welcome.

Still, even before this month, he was already familiar with the kind of language he says was on the notes left at his house.

“Some neighbors, I say ‘hi’ to them, and they just turn away,” Mr. Alhimidi said in Arabic, with his son Mohammed translating. “More than 95 percent of the time, I feel welcome. But once in a while, people shout at you. They shout ‘terrorist,’ or ‘go back to your country.’ ”

Most people in town lamented Ms. Alawadi’s killing as a tragedy. Janet Ilko, a middle school teacher, said the news had come as a shock to students.

“It was upsetting to everyone,” Ms. Ilko, 47, said. “Our community is very close-knit. Our students get along very well. People have been here a long time.”

But tension between the newcomers from the Middle East and some of the town’s other residents was also readily apparent on Main Street, even this week. One woman, 30, who was at a park with her children and refused to give her name, called the city’s Iraqi residents “territorial,” adding, “maybe because we are at war with them.” She said her own background was Mexican, though she had grown up in Southern California.

That tension extends to non-Muslims as well.

“I’ve lived here for 32 years, and I’ve been told many times to go back to my country,” said Sascha Atta, an immigrant from Afghanistan. “Here in El Cajon, most of the Iraqis are not even Muslim, they are Christian, but people don’t know the difference.”

One of those Iraqi Christians is Lara Yalda, 18, who fled the country with her family in 2004, living in Syria for six years before coming to El Cajon, where she is now in high school. She said that last year one teacher told all of the Iraqi students to go back to their country, complaining that they took welfare and other money from the United States. That teacher does not teach Iraqi students anymore but still works at the school, she said.

Ms. Yalda said Ms. Alawadi’s death frightened her.

“Yeah, I’m scared,” Ms. Yalda said. “I feel sad, because here it is a free country, and there is no reason to kill her. She has a family. So why did they kill her? ”

To the Editor:

When I came out my freshman year in college (1979-80). I was fortunate to have a very secure roommate who smiled after my awkward little speech and said, “You did that very well!” There was not a moment’s subsequent discomfort.

Not everyone was so lucky. My freshman-year dorm hall was a fraught place, with most of us living relatively unsupervised for the first time. There was drinking, casual sex, drugs, self-absorption, bad manners, horrible eating habits and heightened social pressure with the constant scrutiny of our hallmates. And this was decades before Twitter and Facebook.

I don’t excuse Dharun Ravi’s deplorable behavior, but I feel that adding today’s technology and social media to the usual confusion of being a dorm-living freshman is creating a perfect storm that is just too much for some 18-year-olds. I advise student housing directors not to think of this as an isolated case of bad behavior, but to ponder how to protect our young adults from themselves and one another as they navigate dorm living’s rocky terrain.

Re “Verdict Repudiates Notion of Youth as Legal Defense” (news article, March 18):

The Rutgers bias crime conviction was no surprise. The instant the student defendant elected not to take the stand, the “jerky kid” defense was doomed. The defendant had one shot — to persuade the jury that what he did was a stupid college prank that went awfully wrong. And the jury had to hear it from him, along with a heavy dose of remorse. To hear that argument made only by his lawyers undermined his defense.

After more than 30 years of representing teenagers across the nation, I was flabbergasted that a member of my profession would say that the guilty verdict for Dharun Ravi means “that the notion of innocent youth as a shield to culpability might not hold as much sway as it once did in court.”

Since at least the early 1980s untold thousands of teenagers, many as young as 13 or 14, have been either charged in or transferred to adult court every year. Our prisons are teeming with adults convicted as teenagers.

We don’t give adults a “pass” when they commit serious crimes at 18, and if done out of hate, whether racial bigotry or homophobia, such crimes are rightfully accorded special status and harshly punished.

In 1990, the legislature added extra prison time for racial, ethnic or religious prejudice. “From now on hate crimes will be serious crimes,” Governor Jim Florio said upon signing the bill, citing “a phone call in the middle of the night or vandalism that leaves hateful symbols in its wake or racial slurs.”

In New Jersey, cases with bias intimidation charges have typically included an underlying offense of significant violence. People have been found guilty under the civil rights law for throwing punches while yelling a racial epithet, for beating a man with a metal rod while cursing him for being from India, and for threatening to shoot a driver, employing a racial slur and then tailgating him for miles. These are cases in which prejudice twists into ugly and serious harm.

Teenagers have also previously been charged with bias intimidation. One boy was convicted for being the ringleader of a bunch of children who ganged up on a girl, calling her a lesbian. Another teenager got in trouble for shoving a boy, using a racial slur and threatening to hang him from a tree. But as juveniles, the kids in these cases were spared harsh punishment. The boy who did the shoving was ordered to spend 10 days in juvenile detention and read the book “Black Like Me.”

Mr. Ravi was 18 years old when he spied on Mr. Clementi, legally an adult, but he did things that reek of immature homophobia. He told a friend he wanted to “keep the gays away,” and when he set up his webcam a second time, his tweets and texts showed that he was giddily trading on Mr. Clementi’s homosexuality to get attention.

Given how broadly the civil rights laws are written, it’s not surprising that prosecutors turned to them to ramp up the charges against Mr. Ravi, especially because this normally increases the pressure on a defendant to plead guilty. The state then made Mr. Ravi a fair offer: community service in exchange for admitting to invading Mr. Clementi’s privacy. It was Mr. Ravi’s mistake not to take it.

Mr. Ravi isn’t the only person caught in this legal snare. After bullying was blamed for the suicide two years ago of Phoebe Prince, a 15-year-old in South Hadley, Mass., prosecutors criminally charged six teenagers. That time, the district attorney used the state’s civil rights laws to directly blame five of them for Phoebe’s death. Like Mr. Ravi, they faced a sentence of up to 10 years. Never mind that the Massachusetts law had previously been used against violent racist thugs. Because it was broadly written, like New Jersey’s, prosecutors could seize upon the law because it “sent a message” about bullying, as one of them later said.

The Massachusetts cases ended with a whimper: After the district attorney who brought the civil rights charges left office, her successor dropped the charges against one teenager and wisely resolved the cases against the other five, who admitted some wrongdoing, with probation and community service.

Mr. Ravi, of course, will not be so lucky. States like New Jersey and Massachusetts should narrow their civil rights laws so that he’s not the first of many stupid but nonviolent young people who pay a too-heavy price for our fears about how kids use technology to be cruel.",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Ravi had seemed so confident that his defense would work that he turned down a plea offer that would have required community service. He now faces a possible prison term and could be deported to India, where he was born.

Lawyers said the trial in New Brunswick had drawn such intense attention that it would shape future cases because youthful indiscretion had always been an appealing defense. “It had a shot of having enough jurors say, ‘This is a jerky kid, and, look, they’ve thrown the book at him,’ ” said Marc R.

The prosecutor, Julia McClure, saw Mr. Ravi’s actions as far more than mischievous. She said they were “mean-spirited, they were malicious, they were criminal.”

But Steven Altman, Mr. Ravi’s lawyer, called him “an 18-year-old boy, a kid,” a college freshman who was not biased against his gay roommate but “didn’t know how to deal with it.”

Ms. Goldberg, the Columbia law professor, said the prosecution had posed an important challenge to the sense in many schools and colleges that youthfulness provided a kind of immunity for activities and speech in the online world. She said many students seemed to believe the ideas put forth by Mr. Ravi’s defense, that being a kid meant there were few limits to how offensive they might be when using digital devices.

“This reinforces that social media can cause great harm and that its misuse can be criminal,” Ms. Goldberg said. She said she expected that the lessons of the courtroom conviction would probably be studied broadly, including in discussions at college orientations across the country.

Defense lawyers said that once Mr. Ravi had decided to take his chances at a trial rather than pleading guilty, there were few options for the defense. The 15-count indictment and Mr. Ravi’s own videotaped acknowledgment of many of the facts gave the prosecutors a powerful arsenal.

The charges took note of the damaging fact that Mr. Ravi had tried to change electronic messages he had sent and seemed to encourage a witness to change her account.

A live witness in the courtroom, Mr. Clementi’s sexual partner, a 30-year-old man identified only as M. B., described the eerie feeling of being watched by the camera on Mr. Ravi’s computer.

And though Mr. Ravi was not charged with the death, there was the ever-present fact of Mr. Clementi’s suicide. The jury heard that a day before Mr. Clementi killed himself, Mr. Ravi sent a message to a friend: “Keep the gays away.”

Faced with that kind of case, it was logical to argue that there was a thin line between a bias crime and an immature college prank, Joseph Tacopina, a New York defense lawyer, said. “What other defense could it have been?” he said.

But after Friday’s conviction, some lawyers said, the risks of rejecting a plea bargain and arguing the jerky-kid defense were obvious. In a similar case in the future, said Ronald L. Kuby, a New York defense lawyer, he would remember what happened to Mr. Ravi.

Over two days of deliberations, jurors said the only count on which they agreed from the outset was the first, that of invading Mr. Clementi’s privacy the first time Mr. Ravi used his webcam to spy on him. “I would classify us as a tight jury,” said Lynn Audet, 45, a schoolteacher from Perth Amboy. “We all respected each other’s opinions, and we all had a turn to talk.”

Other charges were hotly debated but led fairly quickly to votes to convict on other charges, including evidence tampering and witness tampering, Ms. Audet said. “There were text messages missing from his phone but not missing from other persons’ phones,” she said.

The texts from Mr. Ravi to a prosecution witness, Molly Wei, while she was being questioned by the police were “what convinced me of tampering with a witness,” Ms. Audet said. Mr. Ravi was in Ms. Wei’s room when he turned on his webcam and briefly spied on Mr. Clementi.

The bias intimidation charges were the most difficult to agree upon, jurors said. And what tipped the scales there, they said, was that Mr. Ravi had discussed spying on Mr. Clementi not just once, but repeatedly, even inviting his online friends to watch Mr. Clementi and the other man in a second encounter.

That, said Ms. Audet, is what elevated the case from one of teenagers behaving cruelly and insensitively to a crime.

“To attempt a second time, is what changed my mind,” she said. “A reasonable person would have closed it and ended it there, not tweeted about it.”

The webcam did not work for the second encounter; Mr. Ravi, 20, claimed that he had turned it off. But Ms. Audet said evidence suggested that he was lying. “He was at ultimate Frisbee practice,” she said, and evidence showed he then went to a dining hall. “We came to the conclusion that it was Tyler who turned off the computer to make sure he wasn’t filmed a second time.”

She added, “That hit home big.”

An important component of the bias intimidation charges was whether Mr. Clementi felt bullied. Jurors said he left ample evidence that he did: he complained to his resident assistant, he went online to request a room change, he saved screen shots of Mr. Ravi’s more offensive online posts, and he viewed his roommate’s Twitter feed 38 times in the two days before he killed himself by jumping off the George Washington Bridge.

“We’ll never know exactly what he was feeling,” Ms. Audet said. “I can only assume.”

Mr. Ravi’s lawyer pointed to apologetic texts that Mr. Ravi sent Mr. Clementi, in which he said he had no problem with homosexuality and even had a close friend who was gay. (At almost the exact moment he sent the apology, Mr. Clementi, 18, committed suicide after posting on Facebook, “jumping off the gw bridge sorry”).

Mr. Leverett, a student and Twitter user himself, was unmoved. “I can’t speak for everyone on the jury, but me, personally, I believe it was something where he realized what he did was wrong, and it was just too late to amend for what he did.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Of the apology, Ms. Audet said: “My first impression was to believe what he said. Then, as we started reading stuff, we found things in there that I interpreted more as covering.

“The friend he claimed was a good friend in high school, that person was never presented as a defense witness. If that person had come forward and said, ‘Hey, we’ve been good friends, and he knows I’m gay and he doesn’t have a problem with it,’ that might have swayed me in the other direction.”

Ms. Audet, who has a son in high school and a daughter at Rutgers, said she rode home from court “almost in tears” and was brimming with sympathy for both the Clementi and Ravi families. She said she hoped her own children would draw heartfelt lessons from the trial.

“I hope they use their heads and think before they do this,” she said. “Text messages, tweets, e-mails, iChats are never gone. Be careful. I’ve already told my kids, be careful. If you’re going to put something in writing, be able to back it up.

“They felt the pain of Tyler,” he said.

Mr. Ravi, 20, wearing a dark suit over his slight frame, sat expressionless as the jury forewoman read the verdict on the first count, of invasion of privacy. But he seemed surprised when she pronounced him guilty on the next charge, of bias intimidation. His eyes popped and he quickly turned his head from the jury. As he left the courtroom in a swarm of television cameras, his mother clutching his arm, he looked straight ahead and said nothing.

The jury also found him guilty of lying to investigators, trying to influence a witness and tampering with evidence after he tried to cover up Twitter and text messages inviting others to join in the viewing.

Some of the charges carry penalties of 5 to 10 years in prison. Mr. Ravi has surrendered his passport; prosecutors said he could face possible deportation to his native India, but that decision would be left to immigration officials. Judge Glenn Berman set sentencing for May 21.

The case was a rare one in which almost none of the facts were in dispute. Mr. Ravi’s lawyers agreed that he had set up a webcam on his computer, and had then gone into a friend’s room and viewed Mr. Clementi kissing a man he met a few weeks earlier on a Web site for gay men. He sent Twitter and text messages urging others to watch when Mr. Clementi invited the man again two nights later, then deleted messages after Mr. Clementi killed himself.

That account had been established by a long trail of electronic evidence — from Twitter feeds and cellphone records, dormitory surveillance cameras, dining hall swipe cards and a “net flow” analysis showing when and how computers in the dormitory connected.

What the jury had to decide, and what set off debate outside as well as inside the courtroom, was what Mr. Ravi and Mr. Clementi were thinking.

Photo

Had Mr. Ravi set up the webcam because he had a pretty good idea that he would see Mr. Clementi in an intimate moment? Had he targeted Mr. Clementi and the man he was with because they were gay? And had Mr. Clementi been in fear?

Without Mr. Clementi to speak for himself, that last question was perhaps the most difficult to determine, and jurors struggled with it.

“That was the hardest because you really can’t get into someone’s head,” said one, Bruno Ferreira, as he left the court. The jury deliberated longest — for well more than an hour, he said — on the bias intimidation charge.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Ferreira said he ultimately voted guilty on the bias intimidation charge because Mr. Ravi had sent multiple Twitter messages about Mr. Clementi.

“They were being done twice, not just one day,” he said.

Another juror, Kashad Leverett, himself a student and a Twitter user, said he could relate to Mr. Ravi’s constant stream of Twitter and text messages.

But the defense’s insistence that Mr. Ravi had set up the webcam because he was afraid Mr. Clementi’s visitor would steal something, he said, rang hollow.

“If I knew someone was going to steal something from me, I would definitely take it with me,” Mr. Leverett said, adding, “Just from the fact of the second incident, it seemed that it was intentional.”

The jury of seven women and five men deliberated for 13 hours over 3 days after 13 days of testimony.

Reflecting the difficulty of defining hate crimes, it had taken the judge more than an hour simply to instruct the jury on the questions they had to answer to reach a verdict.

The jury concluded that Mr. Ravi had not knowingly or purposely intimidated the men when he watched the first time, on Sept. 19, 2010.

But it found him guilty of the charge because Mr. Clementi “reasonably believed” he had been made a target because he was gay.

The prosecution had pointed out that Mr. Clementi had checked Mr. Ravi’s Twitter feed — where Mr. Ravi told others he had seen his roommate “kissing a dude” — 38 times in the days after the first webcam viewing. Records showed that Mr. Clementi had gone online to request a room change, and a resident assistant testified that Mr. Clementi had complained to him.

Mr. Clementi’s parents, Joe and Jane, attended the trial each day, sitting in the front row and showing little emotion.

After the verdict, Joe Clementi, the director of public works in the northern New Jersey town of Hawthorne, read a brief statement, saying the trial had been “painful for us, as it would be for any parent who must sit and listen to people talk about bad and inappropriate things that were done to their child.”

Mostly, he said, he wanted to deliver a message to middle- and high-school students.

“You’re going to meet a lot of people in your lifetime,” he said. “Some of these people you may not like. Just because you don’t like them doesn’t mean you have to work against them. When you see somebody doing something wrong, tell them: ‘That’s not right. Stop it.’ The change you want to see in the world begins with you.”

Mr. Clementi’s suicide came up only in passing during the trial. Still, the death defined the trial, turning what might have been a peeping Tom case or, as the resident assistant said, “a roommate issue” into something far more grave.

The testimony painted a picture of two college freshmen, both from top-performing high schools in well-off suburbs, who could not have been more different. Mr. Clementi was shy and awkward, an accomplished violinist who had only recently told his parents he was gay. Mr. Ravi was popular but boastful, a computer wizard and ultimate Frisbee player who communicated with friends constantly via Twitter, text message and iChat.

Mr. Ravi’s parents, who brought him here from India when he was young, sat vigil behind him each day, with a large group of friends, including several who had served as character witnesses for Mr. Ravi, testifying he was not biased against gay people.

Mr. Ravi had rejected plea deals, because prosecutors would have required him to admit to bias intimidation. His lawyers said he simply did not believe he had committed a hate crime. They argued that he was “a kid” with little experience of homosexuality who had stumbled into a situation that scared him.

His lead lawyer, Steven Altman, made only a brief statement via e-mail following the verdict, saying “rest assured” he would appeal.

Gay rights advocates, who had used the example of Mr. Clementi’s suicide to push New Jersey to pass what is considered the nation’s toughest antibullying law, hailed the jury’s decision.

“This verdict sends the important message that a ‘kids will be kids’ defense is no excuse to bully another student,” said Steven Goldstein, the chairman of Garden State Equality.

Mr. Kaplan, the county prosecutor, rejected suggestions that Mr. Ravi would not have been on trial if Mr. Clementi had not killed himself. Even if he had not, he said, “under these facts, under this evidence, we would prosecute this case.”",nytimes.com,True

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. — The jury in the trial of a former Rutgers University student accused of invading his roommate’s privacy by using a webcam to watch him in an intimate encounter began deliberations on Wednesday and asked the judge to define two crucial terms.

Jurors asked Judge Glenn Berman of Superior Court in Middlesex County to restate the definition of “intimidate,” as well as of the word “purpose,” as it related to the bias intimidation count.

The judge ruled that the defendant, Dharun Ravi, could be found guilty of bias intimidation only if he was also found guilty of the first charge, invasion of privacy. And he told the jury that the roommate, Tyler Clementi, would have been the victim of bias intimidation if he had been made to feel fear.

“A person is guilty of the crime of bias intimidation,” Judge Berman said, “if he commits an offense with the purpose to intimidate an individual because of sexual orientation.”",nytimes.com,True

“He didn’t like that he had a gay roommate. He was going to use it to his advantage, to expose to other people Tyler’s sexual orientation, to allow him to be shown to be different,” Ms. McClure said. “And the one thing that you don’t want to be in your first three weeks of college is different.”

She concluded, “The defendant’s actions were mean-spirited, they were malicious, they were criminal.”

The facts of the case are supported by an extensive electronic record, including text messages and Twitter feeds and a record of the exact moments of computer activity in the dormitory where the events occurred in September 2010.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Ravi’s lawyer, Mr. Altman, argued that the record never indicated that Mr. Clementi felt intimidated or that Mr. Ravi intended to make him feel that way.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Ravi was “being smart, being cute,” he argued, when he sent a message to a friend at another school promising a “viewing party” to watch Mr. Clementi. No student had testified about a viewing party, he noted, “because one never occurred.”

Mr. Ravi set up the webcam, he argued, because he was concerned about protecting his belongings from the man visiting Mr. Clementi. That man, identified in court documents only as M.B., was 30 at the time, and Mr. Altman argued that to Mr. Ravi he seemed “suspicious.”

Photo

He tried to raise doubts with the jury about M.B., who met Mr. Clementi on a Web site for gay men and visited him only late at night in the dorm. By M.B.’s own account, he added, he did not know Mr. Clementi’s last name after their third and final sexual encounter.

Mr. Altman argued that if Mr. Clementi was so distraught when he read about the webcam viewing after his second encounter with M.B., he would have accepted another place to stay when a resident assistant offered one to him. And he would not have invited M.B. back, he said.

“Would anybody who is being intimidated, scared, in fear, concerned with their privacy, continue with any behavior where he knows his privacy is going to be violated?” Mr. Altman said.

But Ms. McClure argued that if Mr. Ravi was concerned about M.B., he would have taken his possessions with him when he left the room, or when he appeared again in the room a few minutes later.

There was no other reason to set up the webcam, she argued, other “than to expose their sexual orientation, to expose their private sexual activity.”

She reminded the jury that Mr. Clementi had checked Mr. Ravi’s Twitter feed dozens of times after discovering that he had been viewed. “You don’t think that he was intimidated by learning that information?” she said. “Fearful, embarrassed? He’d been exposed, not only his being, his identity, his sexual orientation, but his private sexual activity.”

A friend testified that she and Mr. Ravi had watched briefly. Mr. Ravi then posted a Twitter message and sent text messages to friends about what he had seen.

Another friend testified that Mr. Ravi had asked for his help in angling the camera toward Mr. Clementi’s bed. Mr. Ravi then put a message on Twitter encouraging people to watch after Mr. Clementi asked for the room again two nights later. Mr. Clementi disconnected the camera before the boyfriend arrived that night, after seeing the Twitter message.

Jurors must decide whether Mr. Ravi knowingly intimidated Mr. Clementi because he was gay, and whether Mr. Clementi would reasonably have felt intimidated by his actions.

Prosecutors say that Mr. Ravi erased or changed text and Twitter messages to try to cover his tracks, and that he tried to influence the testimony of the friend who had also watched the encounter. That friend testified for the prosecution in exchange for a more lenient sentence that includes sensitivity training.

Technology experts noted that Mr. Clementi had checked Mr. Ravi’s Twitter feed 38 times in the two days before he jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge. The man who was with him, identified in court only as M.B. because prosecutors consider him a victim, testified that the men heard people joking outside the room and that Mr. Clementi seemed upset by it.

In a video of a police interrogation that was shown to the jury, Mr. Ravi told investigators that he had invaded Mr. Clementi’s privacy, but that he had not done so on purpose. He was, he told investigators, “freaked out” by M.B.’s appearance. His lawyers have argued that Mr. Ravi set up the camera to guard over his belongings.

M.B. was 30 at the time of the encounter, while Mr. Ravi and Mr. Clementi were both 18.

The defense also argues that M.B. raised suspicion in the dorm because he seemed scruffy and was significantly older than the students. Lawyers have also argued that he could not have had an expectation of privacy when he entered a dormitory full of college students. Mr. Ravi may have acted boorishly, they argue, but he is not a bigot. They have used testimony to establish that Mr. Ravi was at Ultimate Frisbee practice the second night he set up the camera, so he had no intention of watching.

The look, shorthanded here as “emo,” has flourished on Baghdad’s streets as an emblem of greater social freedom as society has begun to bloom after years of warfare. But it has drawn scorn and outrage from some religious conservatives, and is often conflated with being gay.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Verifying the reports of the killings has proved nearly impossible. In most cases, no family members or friends have come forward, and Iraqi officials deny that there is any campaign targeting gay men or emo teenagers. They call the stories a media fabrication designed to drum up hysteria and embarrass Iraq.

But it was the Iraqi government that first labeled emo youths a public menace.

On Feb. 13, the Interior Ministry released a statement that condemned the “phenomenon of emo” as Satanic. The rebellious teenage fashions of dark clothes, skull-print T-shirts and nose rings, the statement said, are emblems of the devil.

The ministry said its Social Police would be sent to investigate “the emo” and added that its forces had also received the authority to go into all of Baghdad’s schools to find them.

“They have official approval to eliminate them as soon as possible, because the dimensions of the community began to take another course, and is now threatening danger,” the statement said.

Emo is short for “emotional hardcore” and its aesthetic sprang from the American punk music scene in the 1980s and has been remixed in Baghdad over the last few years.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Ibrahim al-Abadi, an Interior Ministry spokesman, said the statement had been misinterpreted. He said emo youths were free to dress as they pleased, and said the government would protect them.

But over the past month, threatening letters began appearing in Shiite neighborhoods across Baghdad, residents said.

One of the fliers, scanned and posted online, addresses dozens of gay men by name and nickname. It warns people identified as Japanese Haider, Allawi the Bra, Mohammed the Flower and others: Reform your behavior, stop being gay, or face deadly consequences.

“Your fate will be death if you don’t quit doing this,” one leaflet warns. “Punishment will be tougher and tougher, you gays. Don’t be like the people of Lot.”

Another flier circulating around the Zayouna neighborhood appears addressed to emo youths. It tells them to cut their hair, not to wear the clothing of devil worshipers, and not to listen to metal, emo or rap music. And if they refuse, “God’s punishment will be come down upon you,” the letter says.

The authenticity of the fliers could not be verified.

It is unclear who is behind the intimidation or violence. Advocates have blamed Shiite militias such as the Mahdi Army of the radical cleric Moktada al-Sadr for past anti-gay killings and assaults. On Saturday, Mr. Sadr denied any responsibility for the recent threats or violence, but called the emo teens unnatural and said they should be dealt with through legal means, according to Al Sumaria, an Iraqi news channel.

For at least six years, gays have been bullied and harassed by security forces and beaten and killed by reactionary Islamist militias in Shiite areas of Baghdad.

Ali Hili, a gay Iraqi activist who lives in London, said as many as 750 gay Iraqis have been killed in the past six years, and thousands have emigrated or are living deep in the closet.

“It’s a clear war on sexual minorities on Iraq,” he said. “They are refusing to admit it.”

Fear has rippled across socially liberal niches of Baghdad, from the basement-level clothing shops where teenage boys buy skull pendants and skater gear, to upscale hair salons and theaters. Advocates say some emo youths and gay men have left for northern Iraq, while others have shorn off hairdos or muted outfits that were once badges of identity.

Four gay friends in Baghdad, sitting together for an interview, said the daily barrage of harassment and threats has taken on an especially menacing edge in the last few weeks. Neighbors have told them, “Your turn will come soon.” Young men have driven by and shouted “Block! Block! Block!” referring to the current weapon of choice for attacks.

Mustafa, 25, said he was fired last week from a clothing shop because his boss thought his clothing too effete. Hussein, 26, said he left home two weeks ago after his brothers threatened to kill him. Hasan, 32, wears a burgundy ski cap to hide his long hair.

“What do you see about me that is so wrong?” asked Mustafa, who said he was too afraid to allow his full name to be published. “I’m a normal guy. I wish I could die rather than live like this.” With little to go on but denials from the government, gay Iraqis and secular teenagers have been trying to understand what is happening. They have circulated copies of the threatening letters, and passed along pictures that seem to give face to at least one killing that matches the pattern.

In one photo, a handsome young man in a white jacket, dark aviator sunglasses and coifed black hair stands as if he were a fashion model. In another, the vacant, bloody face of a man with similar features stares up at the sky. His body lies in the bed of a police truck.

Friends have identified him as Saif Raad Asmar Abboudi, a 20-year-old from one of the poorest areas of the vast Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City. An Iraqi police report obtained by Mr. Hili’s advocacy group, Iraqi LGBT, says he was beaten to death with a brick on Feb. 17.

The police have not identified a suspect, the report concludes.

One of Mr. Abboudi’s friends, Noor, also 20, described him as a gentle and quiet young man who “was not even very emo.” Being emo in Iraq, she said, was simply about style and self-expression. She said she and her family had fled north after Mr. Abboudi’s death. She did not know when she would feel safe enough to return.

Lawyers for the former student, Dharun Ravi, began their case by calling seven men to the stand, most of whom are software engineers and all of them friends of Mr. Ravi’s father.

“I never heard him say anything about homosexuals or anyone who might be homosexual,” Sandeep Sharma, who manages an information technology company where Mr. Ravi was once an intern, testified.

One of the groups that was moved from the “patriot” list to the hate group list this year is the Georgia Militia, some of whose members were indicted last year in a failed plot to blow up government buildings and spread poison along Atlanta freeways. They were reclassified because their speech includes anti-Semitism.

The far-right patriot movement gained steam in 1994 after the government used violence to shut down groups at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Tex. It peaked after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and began to fade. Its rise began anew in 2008, after the election of Mr. Obama and the beginning of the recession.

There have been declines in some hate groups, including native extremist groups like the Militiamen, which focused on illegal immigration. Chapters of the Ku Klux Klan fell to 152, from 221.

Among the states with the most active hate groups were California, Florida, Georgia, New Jersey and New York. The federal government does not focus on groups that engage in hate-based speech, but rather monitors paramilitary groups and others that have shown some indication of violence, said Daryl Johnson, a former senior domestic terrorism analyst for the Department of Homeland Security.

Prosecutors say that he used his webcam and Twitter messages to bully his roommate because of his homosexuality. Mr. Ravi’s lawyers say he spied on Mr. Clementi not because of antigay sentiment, but because he was suspicious that Mr. Clementi’s boyfriend, an older man who did not attend the school, might steal his equipment.

On Wednesday Mr. Ravi, 20, sat closest to the screen of anyone in the courtroom, and he hung his head as jurors, for the first time, heard his voice.

In the video, Mr. Ravi tells Michael Daniewicz, an investigator with the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office, that on the night of Sept. 19, he was “weirded out” after Mr. Clementi brought a stranger, who testified last week and is known publicly only as M.B., into their room. Mr. Ravi says M.B. gave him a “bad vibe.”

“He didn’t say anything; he just sat on Tyler’s bed,” Mr. Ravi says. “I was freaked out and a little worried about what was happening.” Mr. Ravi says he went into the room of his friend, Molly Wei, and used her computer to activate his camera remotely.

Mr. Ravi says that on the screen he could see one of the men’s backs and “movement.” When the investigator asks if the men were being “intimate,” Mr. Ravi replies, “Yeah.”

Mr. Ravi wrote in a Twitter post that night that he saw Mr. Clementi “making out with some dude. Yay.” Two days later, after Mr. Clementi asked to have the room to himself again, Mr. Ravi sent a Twitter post that read: “Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and midnight. Yes, it’s happening again.”

Robert Torrisi, an investigator with the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office, testified that a forensic analysis of Mr. Ravi’s BlackBerry showed that the second Twitter post had been edited on the night of Sept. 22 to begin, “People with iChat, don’t you dare video chat me.” Mr. Ravi told the police that he then sent a message: “Everyone ignore that last tweet. Stupid drafts.”

He said he altered his posts because “I realized they could be interpreted by anybody.”

Mr. Ravi said that he felt “shocked,” “very awkward,” “really uncomfortable” and “guilty” after viewing the scene from his webcam, and closed out the window after a few seconds.

Mr. Ravi said he received a visit on the night of Sept. 22 from Raahi Grover, a resident assistant in the dorm, who said that Mr. Clementi had come to him upset. Mr. Ravi said he learned from Mr. Grover that Mr. Clementi had saved a copy of his message daring others to view the webcam.

“Tyler thought I was trying to broadcast him and telling a bunch of people to watch it,” Mr. Ravi told investigators. “I didn’t want him to think I was spying on him. I don’t know who would want to see that.”

So he sent his roommate an apology at 8:46 p.m. on Sept. 22. “I want to make amends for Sunday night,” Mr. Ravi wrote. “I’ve known you were gay and I have no problem with it.”

Mr. Ravi told investigators, “I was waiting for his response while I was trying to fall asleep that night.”

Four minutes before Mr. Ravi sent his apology, Mr. Clementi posted on his Facebook page: “Jumping off the gw bridge sorry.” Mr. Ravi said he saw that post the next morning.

In the two days before he jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge, Mr. Clementi checked Mr. Ravi’s Twitter account 38 times, said the investigator, Detective Gary Charydczak of the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office.

Detective Charydczak, who reviewed the contents of both men’s computers, also testified that Mr. Clementi had saved screen snapshots of two of Mr. Ravi’s postings, one of which said Mr. Ravi had watched Mr. Clementi on a webcam “making out with a dude,” the other urging friends to view the images from his webcam on an evening when he expected both men to have another encounter in the Rutgers dorm room.

Mr. Ravi is on trial in Middlesex County Superior Court on charges that include bias intimidation, invasion of privacy and destruction of evidence. He is not charged with causing his roommate’s suicide, but prosecutors say his Twitter feeds and webcam spying amount to criminal bullying on account of Mr. Clementi’s sexual orientation. Mr. Ravi’s lawyers say that he was not bothered by Mr. Clementi’s homosexuality, and that he had his webcam trained on Mr. Clementi only because he was suspicious that his sexual partner, an older man Mr. Clementi had met online, might steal his equipment.

With the detective’s testimony on Tuesday, prosecutors tried to use both men’s computer trails to show that Mr. Ravi was bothered by his roommate’s sexuality and that Mr. Clementi was troubled by Mr. Ravi’s messages, two crucial facets in an intimidation case.

Detective Charydczak said he examined both the hard drive on Mr. Clementi’s Sony laptop computer, as well as the two hard drives custom-built into Mr. Ravi’s desktop Dell computer. His investigation showed that in the early morning hours of Sept. 21, Mr. Clementi saved a screenshot of a Twitter post that Mr. Ravi had sent two days earlier; it read: “Roommate asked for the room until midnight. I went into molly’s room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.”

Upon visiting him in his dorm room, M.B. said, he noticed a webcam pointing at him from atop Mr. Ravi’s desktop computer.

Prosecutors say Mr. Ravi initially used his webcam to spy on Mr. Clementi from a computer in a neighboring dorm room on Sunday, Sept. 19, 2010, and tried to do it again two days later after Mr. Clementi again asked to have their room to himself.

In a text message, Mr. Ravi told Ms. Huang: “I got so creeped out after Sunday.” Ms. Huang suggested that Mr. Clementi and his date might use Mr. Ravi’s bed, and Mr. Ravi replied, “My webcam checks my bed, hahaha.”

He then wrote, “Yeah, keep the gays away.”

Mr. Ravi told Ms. Huang that his webcam was set to “automatically accept” whenever anyone tried to view its feed from another computer.

“I tested it and it works,” Mr. Ravi wrote. “Be careful it could get nasty.”

When a prosecutor, Julia McClure, asked Ms. Huang what she understood Mr. Ravi to have meant, she testified that she believed that the webcam feed would show “a man with another man.” Ms. Huang had referred in text messages to Mr. Ravi’s “gay roomie” and asked, “Did you really see him make out with some guy?”

A defense lawyer, Steven Altman, called Ms. Huang’s memory into question after she answered yes when he asked if some of the testimony she gave police investigators in January was “impacted by what you read in the newspaper.” The defense has maintained that Mr. Ravi checked his webcam out of fear that Mr. Clementi’s guest might steal some of his property, not because he was biased against gay men.

In his exchange of text messages with Ms. Huang on that Tuesday, Mr. Ravi alluded to having told others about his webcam.

“People are having a viewing party with a bottle of Bacardi and beer in this kid’s room for my roommate,” Mr. Ravi said.

On the Wednesday, Ms. Huang sent a message to Mr. Ravi asking what had happened the previous night. Mr. Ravi replied, “It got messed up and didn’t work.”

That Thursday afternoon, Mr. Ravi told Ms. Huang in a text message that he had learned that Mr. Clementi had committed suicide.

Bergen County prosecutors said the man, Aakash Dalal, 19, of New Brunswick, had instigated the attacks and had given the first man arrested, Anthony Graziano, 19, of Lodi, information on how to make incendiary devices.

Mr. Graziano was charged in January in the firebombing of synagogues in Rutherford and Paramus. He was also charged with plotting a third attack on a Jewish community center.

It was two weeks later, when prosecutors went to his house, that the man learned that the camera, on Mr. Clementi’s roommate’s computer, had been used to view them as they had sex.

The roommate, Dharun Ravi, is on trial in Superior Court here on charges of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation and hindering apprehension, after, prosecutors say, he tried to cover up his Twitter messages alerting friends to watch the men having sex.

Mr. Ravi is not charged with Mr. Clementi’s death, but the suicide hangs over the case. It prompted a worldwide debate about the bullying of gay teenagers, particularly in a digital age, when taunting and harassment come not always face-to-face but on an array of technological devices and forums. Several gay teenagers had committed suicide in the months before Mr. Clementi jumped off the bridge, and his death became a symbol of their collective pain.

Mr. Ravi’s lawyers said he might have been childish, but he was not a bigot, and that convicting him would be criminalizing the ordinary awkwardness of freshman roommates with little in common. Mr. Ravi was born in India; he was an Ultimate Frisbee-playing computer whiz from a high-performing high school in a well-to-do town near Princeton; Mr. Clementi was an accomplished violinist from a high-performing high school in a well-to-do suburb at the other end of the state. Socially awkward, he had only recently told his parents he was gay.

Mr. Ravi’s friends and teammates have testified that he told them he had set up the webcam and that he appeared to be “uncomfortable” about having a gay roommate.

But the man testifying Friday, who said he was 30 when he met Mr. Clementi, was the most anticipated witness in the trial. To prosecutors, he is a victim of harassment based on sexual orientation — a sort of proxy for Mr. Clementi. To the defense, he is evidence that Mr. Ravi was not motivated by bigotry but by suspicion — of an older man who was furtive and out of place among the college freshmen in the dorm.

In a rare exception, the man was identified in court only as M. B., and the judge warned journalists that they could not record or photograph him.

M. B. entered with his shoulders hunched, twitching slightly as he walked. But his voice on the stand was strong.

He and Mr. Clementi met on a social networking Web site for gay men in early August 2010, he said, then exchanged instant and text messages for several weeks.

Their first date was a few weeks later, on Thursday, Sept. 16. They met twice more, on the next Sunday and Tuesday, before Mr. Clementi committed suicide.

At first Mr. Clementi’s dorm room seemed normal, M. B. testified.

But then, he noticed the camera. “I just thought it was kind of strange,” he testified. “Just being in a compromising position and seeing a camera lens — I guess it just stuck out to me that if you were sitting at a desk using the computer, that camera wouldn’t be facing that direction, it would be facing the person at the computer.”

In court, M. B. had close-cropped hair and a 5 o’clock shadow. He wore a blue and white striped shirt, more casual than the tailored suits of Mr. Ravi and his friends who have testified. But his cheeks were flushed, and he did not look, as Mr. Ravi’s friends have described him, “scruffy” or “shady.”

Pictures taken by surveillance cameras in the dormitory showed him dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, his hair and bearing much the same as they were on Friday. He testified that he had not shaved the evening before he went to the dorm.

As he left the room that Sunday, around midnight, he said, he saw a group of about five students and sensed they were staring at him. “Had they been in the street or somewhere other than this building, I would have asked them why they were looking at me,” he testified. “Because I was a guest in the building, I wasn’t going to ask.”

When he returned Tuesday night, he and Mr. Clementi heard people joking outside the room. “There was a visible reaction in Tyler in hearing those voices,” he testified.

Defense lawyers argue that M. B. could not have expected privacy, and that if he had been nervous about the webcam, he would not have gone back to the room. Under cross-examination, M. B. testified that Mr. Clementi did not introduce him to the other students they passed in the dormitory. M. B. said he had avoided eye contact with them.

Mr. Ravi, now 20, sat impassively, as he has through much of the trial, his chin on his fist, occasionally yawning.

His parents and a group of their friends filled the rows behind him. On the other side of the courtroom were two rows filled with Mr. Clementi’s parents, brothers and friends. Mr. Clementi’s father began to rock back and forth in his seat as M. B. began describing how he became intimate with Tyler.

The testimony has done little to shed light on the reasons Tyler Clementi killed himself. In the text messages that consumed much of his new relationship with M. B., he comes across as a young man newly and eagerly infatuated.

Less than 24 hours before he jumped from the bridge, he sent M. B. a text: “Of course I wanna chill w/u, been looking forward to it all day!” As M. B. was on his way to the dorm, Mr. Clementi texted again: “Close?”

Mr. Ravi’s lawyer, Steven Altman, pressed M. B. as to why they had not arranged to meet for coffee or gone to the mall or a movie — suggesting in his argument that M. B. was just after a quick sexual encounter.

But M. B. said that he had left the room without staying the night because he knew that Mr. Ravi would soon be back, and that he might be uncomfortable finding two gay men there. “I didn’t want to cause any type of conflict between them,” he said.

“I left happy, he was happy,” he said, describing his last contact with Mr. Clementi. When he did not hear from Mr. Clementi, he said, he texted him “twice a day every day.” Finally, he said, he picked up a newspaper and read about his death.",nytimes.com,True

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. — After discovering that his roommate had set up a webcam in their room and watched him kissing a man, Tyler Clementi sent an e-mail to the resident assistant in the dormitory that said, “I feel my privacy has been violated, and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this wildly inappropriate manner.”

The next day, Mr. Clementi, an 18-year-old Rutgers student, jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge.

The resident assistant, Raahi Grover, testified in Middlesex County Court here on Wednesday that when he went to Mr. Clementi’s roommate, Dharun Ravi, after the suicide, he tried to explain himself.

“I told him, ‘It’s not me who needs to be explained to,’ ” Mr. Grover said.

Mr. Ravi, now 20, is facing up to 10 years in prison on charges of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation and hindering apprehension. Prosecutors said that shortly after the roommates arrived at Rutgers in September 2010, Mr. Ravi trained the webcam on Mr. Clementi and a date whom Mr. Clementi had invited to his room, and then encouraged others to watch in what the prosecutors said amounted to a campaign of harassment because Mr. Clementi was gay.

The police had already interviewed Mr. Ravi and Ms. Wei, separately, about why they had used Mr. Ravi’s webcam and briefly watched Mr. Clementi in an intimate encounter with another man.

“Did you tell them we did it on purpose?” Mr. Ravi asked Ms. Wei, according to her testimony in Mr. Ravi’s trial Monday. When Ms. Wei replied that she had, explaining that they had not expected to see Mr. Clementi kissing another man, Mr. Ravi wrote back, “I said we were just messing around with the camera.”

Mr. Ravi is on trial in Middlesex Superior Court on charges of bias intimidation as a hate crime, invasion of privacy and hindering apprehension. He is not charged with contributing to the suicide of Mr. Clementi, whose body was found several days after he jumped from the bridge, but the state of mind of both men is critical to the case. Prosecutors say Mr. Ravi, motivated by antigay sentiment, intentionally set out to embarrass Mr. Clementi; Mr. Ravi’s lawyers have portrayed him as a young man who may have acted foolishly, but was not homophobic and did not intend to hurt his roommate.

Also on Monday, a Rutgers employee testified that Mr. Clementi had submitted a request online around 4 a.m. Sept. 21, 2010, to be transferred to a single room. On that form, Mr. Clementi wrote that he wanted to move to a single room because “roommate used webcam to spy on me.” But Judge Glenn Berman did not allow that statement into evidence, ruling that it was hearsay.",nytimes.com,True

Altman, repeatedly stated that there had been no intimidation, and that his client had neither felt nor expressed any dislike of gays.

“We do stupid things, we make mistakes, especially when we’re young — it doesn’t mean we’re hateful, we’re bigoted or we’re criminal,” he said. “In fact, Dharun never intimidated anyone.

“He never committed a crime, he never committed a hateful crime. He’s not homophobic. He’s not antigay.”

The case illustrates the ways the fields of hate crime and cybercrime prosecution are expanding. Until the 1990s, few states had such laws, which increase the penalties for acts motivated by dislike of a particular group. And the earlier laws generally did not include bias based on sexual orientation, which was added later in many states. Laws against online harassment are even newer.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

New Jersey’s decade-old bias intimidation law has usually been invoked when the underlying crime is something more serious than invasion of privacy, like assault or face-to-face intimidation. But experts say that embarrassing images displayed online play a growing role in both bias-related and bullying cases.

“There haven’t been many prosecutions quite like this, so it’s hard to know how it will play out,” said Louis Raveson, a professor at Rutgers law school.

“In order for it to fit the definition of bias intimidation, the act doesn’t have to have been for the purpose of intimidation,” he said. “If you can show that the victim was intimidated, and reasonably believes he was singled out because of his orientation, that can be sufficient.”

In other words, the verdict on the most serious charge will depend on the state of mind of Mr. Ravi, Mr. Clementi, or both.

To that end, on Friday, Ms. McClure, the prosecutor, called four Rutgers classmates to the stand to attest to what Mr. Ravi had done, showing that his roommate’s sex life had been very much on his mind and that the spying had relied on advance planning. On cross-examination, Mr. Altman elicited from those same witnesses testimony that Mr. Ravi had shown no hatred of gays or of Mr. Clementi.

The witnesses were among several people who discussed the electronic spying with Mr. Ravi, or were present when it took place, and none of them have said that they or anyone else objected to it.

Mr. Altman argued that much of what had been written and said about the case was wrong — for example, the spying on Mr. Clementi, he said, lasted just two to five seconds, and it showed nothing more explicit than two men kissing, a description supported by the witnesses. He also repeatedly described his client as a boy barely out of high school.

Much of the early commentary on the case presumed a link between the spying and the suicide of Mr. Clementi, a shy, socially awkward violin player. But no evidence of his motivation for killing himself has become public, and it was not clear whether the trial would shed any light on his reasons.

In the courtroom, Mr. Clementi’s parents and his brother, James — who looks much like Tyler — looked on impassively, as did members of Mr. Ravi’s family.

Mr. Ravi, who was born in India and grew up in Plainsboro, N.J., could be deported if convicted. A crucial witness will be Molly Wei, the friend who had joined Mr. Ravi in spying on Mr. Clementi, from her dorm room and with her computer. Initially, Ms. Wei also faced charges, but they were dropped and she agreed to testify.

Prosecutors said that when the case resumed on Monday, they planned to call a Rutgers official who dealt with Mr. Clementi’s request to change roommates after he learned of the spying.

The man, Anthony Graziano, 19, of Lodi, was arrested in the Jan. 11 attack on a Rutherford synagogue and the Jan. 3 firebombing of a Paramus synagogue. He was being held in $5 million bail.

The charges include nine counts of attempted murder, bias intimidation, arson and aggravated arson.

“We have no doubt that the arson and attempted murder in Rutherford were a direct result of Mr. Graziano’s hatred of people of the Jewish faith,” the county prosecutor, John Molinelli, said.

The authorities said Mr. Graziano, who is unemployed, was a 2010 high school graduate and a loner who lacked access to a car but searched the Internet for nearby synagogues. He rode his bike to the two sites and, at the Rutherford synagogue, threw Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices, officials said. He is thought to have acted alone.",nytimes.com,True

But federal prosecutors replied on Friday that Mr. Mullet posed a danger to the community and that the Amish aversion to electricity had not figured in the decision to keep him in custody until his trial, which is now scheduled for March.

Mr. Mullet and six followers from his isolated compound in Bergholz, Ohio, have been in jail since Nov. 23, charged with hate crimes and conspiracy. The group is accused of carrying out at least four violent attacks in which Amish men were held down while their beards were hacked off with scissors and clippers, and a woman’s own children turned on her and forcibly sheared large patches of her hair. These were acts of religious humiliation, prosecutors and other Amish said, because men’s beards and women’s long hair are central to Amish identity.

Mr. Mullet, 66, ran his community like a cult, prosecutors charged, imprisoning men in a chicken coop and requiring married women to have sex with him “to cleanse them of the devil.” For years, he nursed grudges against other Amish who had not supported his effort to excommunicate those who fled his control.

Mr. Mullet’s public defender, Edward G. Bryan, argued in a motion on Thursday that the refusal to grant bail reflected, in part, an assumption that electronic monitoring was not feasible because Mr. Mullet’s home is not on the grid. “Mr. Mullet informs that he is not opposed to allowing electricity to be installed at his residence to accommodate an electronic monitoring device,” the motion said. “It is not part of the Amish belief system that electricity is per se evil,” it said. Rather, the Amish shun appliances that reduce family members’ reliance on one another and lead to “idle time.”",nytimes.com,True

Later, they talked with Mrs. Cisner about the week’s Torah portion in Yiddish, and ate pizza. A few women carefully, subtly, wrapped the slices in napkins and stashed them in their purses. Most of the women are in their 80s. Many are widowed and live on meager monthly reparations from the German government. Nachas — which in Yiddish means “joy” or “pride” — sustains them.

But those thoughts have come flooding back as news of the anti-Semitic crimes — not all of which were related — has been broadcast on television and printed in newspapers.

In Flatbush in November, four cars were burned, two painted with swastikas, two emblazoned with “KKK.” The police are investigating it as a possible case of insurance fraud. In December, a sign for the Avenue J subway line was spray-painted to read “Avenue Jew.” This month, swastikas were scrawled on four storefronts on Avenue of the Americas.

Last weekend, a residential garage near Avenue L and outdoor staircases to a nearby religious school were painted with swastikas. Elderly residents in Manhattan and in Sheepshead Bay have received threatening phone calls.

On Monday, the police arrested David Haddad, charging him with aggravated harassment as a hate crime involving several acts. Mr. Haddad is the suspect in 10 harassing phone calls, said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman. Mr. Haddad is also suspected of painting swastikas in the building in which he lives, Mr. Browne said, and painting four swastikas near Avenue L and East Fifth Street in Brooklyn.

The police said that he had a business dispute with the victims, and was related to two of them.

“I don’t care if the person is Jewish,” said Wolf Sender, the district manager for Community Board 12 in Brooklyn, which includes Borough Park. “Hate is hate.”

Of 119 anti-Semitic acts of vandalism, verbal and physical assaults, anti-Semitic graffiti, and other related incidents in 2011, 39 were in Brooklyn, according to the Anti-Defamation League. In 2010, 53 of the 133 occurred in Brooklyn.

Last year, the Police Department investigated 104 anti-Semitic cases, compared with 134 in 2010, Mr. Browne said.

In that case, on Jan. 3, the flames died down on their own, leaving little damage by the time congregants came for morning prayers, said Chaim Shapiro, the rabbi of the synagogue.

In addition to those two arsons, the authorities are investigating two December cases in which drawings of swastikas were found on Bergen County synagogues in Hackensack and Maywood.

“We’re assuming right now that everything is connected until proven otherwise,” Mr. Ward said.

Congregation Beth El, which Rabbi Schuman has led for several years, is the only synagogue in Rutherford, a town of some 18,000, whose Jewish community has dwindled over the decades. Except for a small sign outside, the home in which the synagogue sits is unrecognizable to most passers-by as a religious institution.

“I wouldn’t think we created a big enough profile to spawn a malicious deed like this,” said Mr. Goldberg, the congregation’s president.

Because the synagogue is so nondescript and because one of the Molotov cocktails appeared to have been directed at the bedroom window of Rabbi Schuman, the authorities suggested that the home had been targeted.

“It wasn’t an easy throw,” said the Bergen County prosecutor, John L. Molinelli. “I believe this person knew that it was a residence, that it was somebody’s bedroom.”

Also at the home when the attack occurred were Rabbi Schuman’s wife and their five children, as well as his father and mother-in-law, Mr. Goldberg said. Rabbi Schuman wrote on his synagogue’s Web site that in Rutherford he had “found the best of both worlds: a warm, close-knit synagogue, where everyone is welcome, in the proximity” of larger Jewish communities.

Mr. Molinelli said that he thought the attack was “certainly a hate crime.”

“We no longer look upon this as something that is unique to the Jewish community,” Mr. Molinelli said. “This is now affecting the entire Bergen County and North Jersey community.”

The authorities did not identify any suspects in the Rutherford arson or in the other cases.

The mayor of Rutherford, Joseph DeSalvo Jr., said he knew of no other bias crime in his community in recent memory.

“Incidents like this never happen in Rutherford,” said Mr. DeSalvo, who lives a few homes from the Schumans. “But unfortunately this morning, it happened.”",nytimes.com,True

From there, officials say, his reasons varied: He targeted the wrong house on a street in Queens where he said he once purchased crack cocaine. He took aim at an Islamic center off the Van Wyck Expressway, while 100 people were worshiping inside, over his treatment after asking to use its bathroom. He attacked a house in Elmont, just over the Nassau County border, over vague claims of a familial problem. His final attack was on a home on 170th Street in Queens that houses a small Hindu temple; he told detectives that a nemesis of his, from five or six years ago, was there.

In four of the five attacks, Starbucks Frappuccino bottles were used to create Molotov cocktails, and remnants of those 9.5-ounce bottles were recovered by investigators from those locations. In fact, the police said the suspect was caught on videotape at 5:56 p.m. Sunday, about two hours before the first attack, at a gas station, filling up five of those bottles.

When Mr. Lengend was taken into custody on Tuesday morning, there were three more empty Frappuccino bottles in the back seat of his Avis rental car, stolen from Kennedy International Airport at 3 a.m. Friday, the police said.

“The suspect has made statements implicating himself in each of the five firebombings, indicating a personal grievance in each,” said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman.

Officials believe that the suspect was also motivated by hate. In interviews with detectives, he made broad, anti-Muslim statements and said he initially planned to use the five Starbucks bottles against the Islamic center, but did not carry out his plan when he saw a police presence there, according to one law enforcement official.

No one was injured in the attacks, which resulted in varying degrees of property damage.

The crucial clue in identifying the suspect was his car; witnesses described a suspect in a sedan with Virginia license plates, and video showed a similar vehicle.

Detectives Charles LoPresti and Richard Johnson of the 103rd Precinct canvassed much of the Jamaica, Queens, neighborhood — the attacks occurred within two miles of one another — and spotted a gray, four-door Buick Regal with Virginia plates, parked legally on Monday night. They watched the car until 7:50 a.m., when the suspect emerged and was placed in custody.

“They were observant and persistent, literally through the dark of the night,” said Mr. Browne, who said the suspect lived nearby and was an unemployed truck driver.

By Tuesday evening, the suspect had claimed responsibility for three other firebombings, against homes in Queens on Dec. 26 and this week, Mr. Browne said, adding that the police were investigating the claims.

As in the other instances, the suspect claimed “he has some kind of grievance with the people living there,” Mr. Browne said. Detectives are trying to find out what set him off on a rampage against so many locations.

Officials said the suspect had several previous arrests, on charges including drug possession, grand larceny and possession of bad checks. His most recent was in Queens in November 2009, the police said.

In the first attack, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said the deli owner had told investigators about an episode on Dec. 27 in which he or his employees ejected a man who was trying to shoplift. As workers pushed the man out of the store, Mr. Kelly said, “He said words to the effect of, ‘We’re going to get even. We’re going to get back at you.’ ”

Salah Salim, 32, who owns the store on Hillside Avenue, said an employee saw the man stealing the milk and the Frappuccino, so Mr. Salim confronted him.

“At first, he gives me the milk back,” recalled Mr. Salim, who was reached by phone. “He said, ‘I’m sorry, I have nothing else.’ And then my employee said, ‘There’s one more.’ ”

Mr. Salim said he grabbed the man by his jacket collar and the man removed the bottle of Frappuccino from his pocket.

One attack occurred at an Islamic center where about 100 people were worshiping, and another at a bodega owned by a Muslim immigrant from Yemen. At the fourth site, a house on 107th Avenue, the residents said that they were Christians and that they were baffled by the attack.

In a fifth episode on Sunday night, a bottle containing flammable liquid was thrown onto the porch of a house in Elmont, just across the Nassau County border. The case had “some characteristics” of the pattern in Queens, a spokesman for the Nassau County police said.

No arrests were made as of Monday night. The police released a sketch of a suspect and described him as a black man 25 to 30 years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 200 pounds and wearing a black jacket and a baseball cap. He was seen driving a light-color sedan.

The Queens attacks occurred in one of the more diverse stretches of the city’s most diverse borough. Jamaica Avenue and Hillside Avenue, two main thoroughfares, are dotted with halal shops, Latino restaurants, Hindu temples and storefront Christian churches. Once predominantly black, the neighborhood has had influxes of immigrants from many parts of the world, including Guyana, the West Indies, Central America, South Asia, and Arabic-speaking lands.

“Everyone gets along, no problems,” said Salem Ahmed, 38, the owner of the bodega, on Hillside Avenue and 180th Street, that was firebombed about 8 p.m.

Mr. Ahmed said a man ran into the store and threw a flaming bottle over the deli counter at the small 24-hour grocery store, which he opened soon after arriving from Yemen 20 years ago.

The bottle fell to the floor without breaking and caused a small fire easily extinguished by a worker, he said.

He said his first thought was about a man whom workers threw out for shoplifting. “But I don’t think it’s him,” he said.

In the attack on the Al-Khoei Islamic Center, along the Van Wyck Expressway, two flaming bottles were thrown at the entrance, causing a small fire shortly before 9 p.m.

Imam Maan Al-Sahlani, an Iraqi immigrant, said a service had just ended when the attack took place. There was little damage, he said, but the attack caused concern among some members that Muslims might have been targeted.

“You really can’t accuse one religion or a party without knowing more about it,” he said.

He said that the center, which opened in 1989, had had no disputes with anyone. It serves a diverse membership with services held in English, Arabic, Persian and Urdu. Its leaders are mostly Iraqi immigrants, and its members are mostly Lebanese.

The imam said he had heard about the attack on the Hindu temple, and added, “Some people confuse Hindus and Muslims.” The police had promised protection for the Islamic center, and the stepped-up security had reassured its members.

In Elmont, Bejai Rai and his wife were getting ready for bed in their home on Glafil Street around 9:40 when they heard a loud crash, Mr. Rai said, “as if the chandelier had fallen down.” One of their sons watched as a man rushed away and into a late model two-door car, either champagne or silver in color.

Mr. Rai said it appeared that the bottle had bounced off the house and crashed on the concrete walkway without setting anything afire.

“We are terribly nervous,” said Mr. Rai, a Hindu from Guyana. “If they’re going to bomb a house, to burn a house down, they want to kill us. Why would someone want to do that to us?”

Mr. Maharaj, who operates the Hindu temple, said Monday that he had not slept, but that he would conduct his usual prayer service Monday night.

A similar weapon was found at the bodega, the site of the first attack, according to the police. The bomb might have been thrown from inside the store, because the counter sustained some damage, the police said.

Many Africans believe that homosexuality is an import from the West, and ironically they invoke religious beliefs and colonial-era laws that are foreign to our continent to persecute us.

The way I see it, homophobia — not homosexuality — is the toxic import. Thanks to the absurd ideas peddled by American fundamentalists, we are constantly forced to respond to the myth — debunked long ago by scientists — that homosexuality leads to pedophilia. For years, the Christian right in America has exported its doctrine to Africa, and, along with it, homophobia. In Uganda, American evangelical Christians even held workshops and met with key officials to preach their message of hate shortly before a bill to impose the death penalty for homosexual conduct was introduced in Uganda’s Parliament in 2009. Two years later, despite my denunciation of all forms of child exploitation, David Bahati, the legislator who introduced the bill, as well as Foreign Minister Henry Okello Oryem and other top government officials, still don’t seem to grasp that being gay doesn’t equate to being a pedophile.

In May, following criticism from the West and President Yoweri Museveni, the bill was shelved. But the current parliament has revived it and could send it to the floor for a vote at any time. Meanwhile, the bill’s influence has been felt in Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon, all of which have recently stepped up enforcement of anti-gay laws or moved to pass new legislation that would criminalize love between people of the same sex.

Not all Ugandans are homophobic. Some say there are more pressing issues to worry about than gay people and believe we should have the same rights as anyone else. But they are not in power and cannot control the majority who want to hurt us.

A veil of silence enforced by thuggish street violence and official criminalization is falling over much of Africa. Being a gay activist is a sacrifice. You have to carefully choose which neighborhood to live in. You cannot go shopping on your own, let alone go clubbing or to parties. With each public appearance you risk being attacked, beaten or arrested by the police.

I remember the moment when my friend David Kato, Uganda’s best-known gay activist, sat with me in the small unmarked office of our organization, Sexual Minorities Uganda. “One of us will probably die because of this work,” he said. We agreed that the other would then have to continue. In January, because of this work, David was bludgeoned to death at his home, with a hammer. Many people urged me to seek asylum, but I have chosen to remain and fulfill my promise to David — and to myself. My life is in danger, but the lives of those whose names are not known in international circles are even more vulnerable.

Still, I continue to hope. There are encouraging times when my fellow activists and I meet people face to face and they realize we aren’t the child-molesting monsters depicted in the media. They realize we are human, we are Ugandan, just like them.

Twenty-five years later, this is the legacy of a racial attack in Howard Beach, Queens:

One of the victims died in the attack and is memorialized in a Brooklyn street sign, another died five years later, and the third is in jail in Virginia for unrelated crimes. The three teenagers convicted of manslaughter were released from prison and are family men in their 40s. A leader of the attack, who became the key prosecution witness and dreamed of following in his father's footsteps in law enforcement, never did become a police officer.

In a precedent-setting decision, the judge in the case ruled that defense lawyers could no longer arbitrarily reject black jurors in criminal trials. Two years after the case went to trial, a black man was elected mayor of New York. The Queens neighborhood where the attack occurred is still predominantly white. The local pizzeria where the assault began is as popular as ever but now charges $2.50 a slice.

The scars of the deadly racial assault that started on Dec. 19, 1986, and polarized New York City have faded, but have not fully healed.

Jean Griffith Sandiford, the mother of Michael Griffith, 23, who was chased to his death on the Belt Parkway, has forgiven her son's killers. But the mother-in-law of one of his attackers suggests that the case was blown out of proportion. Others argue that the assault was more about turf than race and that the three black men who ventured into the overwhelmingly white neighborhood that night were probably up to no good.

Howard Beach became a singular flash point, as outraged black New Yorkers demanded justice and as some whites in the neighborhood, including those who brandished watermelons to taunt protesters, angrily denied that they were racists or even that the attack was racially motivated.

''I could recall 25 years ago as a kid, I would not recommend anyone black stopping there,'' said Representative Gregory W. Meeks, who is black and represents Old Howard Beach, east of Cross Bay Boulevard. ''Today, it's definitely a different place.''

While the proportion of non-Hispanic white residents in the area that includes Howard Beach and some adjacent neighborhoods has declined to 74 percent, from 94 percent in 1980, the share of blacks remains below 2 percent.

Elizabeth Braton, chairwoman of the local community board, said: ''The community is comprised today, as it was then, of thousands of law-abiding citizens who were in no way, shape or form involved in that incident. It was a horrendous crime committed by individuals.''

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo - responding to demands from Basil A. Paterson, a former deputy mayor; the Rev. Al Sharpton; and other black leaders - named Charles J. Hynes as a special prosecutor to investigate the case. As the chief trial lawyer, Mr. Hynes won three convictions for manslaughter and prevailed on the judge, Justice Thomas A. Demakos of State Supreme Court, to impose stiff consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences.

Today, Mrs. Sandiford works for Mr. Hynes as a community liaison.

''Twenty-five years ago it was unthinkable that an African-American would be in the White House,'' Mr. Hynes said. ''Twenty-five years ago all the cops looked like me and came from the suburbs.''

Mr. Sharpton, who himself became a lightning rod in the aftermath of the attack, recalled: ''Howard Beach brought to the attention of the country that this could happen in the North. It was as ugly as anything in Selma. The good news is that we don't have a lot of Howard Beach situations.''

The events in Howard Beach began when Mr. Griffith, a construction worker, and three black companions traveled from Brooklyn to Queens to pick up his paycheck. Their car broke down late on Dec. 19 on a desolate stretch of Cross Bay Boulevard, and three of the four began walking into Howard Beach. As they were crossing the street, they were nearly bumped by a car in which several white teenagers were riding. Racial slurs were exchanged. The teenagers, joined by other young whites, confronted the black men outside a pizza parlor, New Park Pizza, and chased them.

Timothy Grimes, who was 18, escaped unharmed. Mr. Griffith was killed by a car on the Belt Parkway. Cedric Sandiford, who was 36, was beaten with a bat and other weapons.

Mr. Sandiford married Jean Griffith, Mr. Griffith's mother, in 1989 and died in 1991 while ill with AIDS. Mr. Grimes was convicted in 1989 of shooting his brother in Virginia, where he is still incarcerated after committing other crimes in prison. In 1999, six blocks of Pacific Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, were named for Mr. Griffith, who lived there as a child.

Jon Lester, Scott Kern and Jason Ladone were convicted of manslaughter and assault.

Mr. Ladone was released in 2000. Six years later, while working for the city's Transportation Department, he was arrested for drug possession, but the case was dismissed.

Mr. Lester, who lived in South Ozone Park, Queens, underwent ''aggression replacement training,'' earned an associate degree in prison, taught himself the guitar and composed a song dedicated to Jean Griffith Sandiford and the mothers of other principals in the case.

During a parole hearing, he said, ''I'm not the same stupid kid that I was back then.'' He insisted that the attack was about territory and blamed it on ''everybody being so young, being drunk, peer pressure.''

''I was not a racist person that I went out and actively called out black people,'' Mr. Lester said.

He was deported in 2001 to his native Britain.

Mr. Kern was released in 2002 and, like Mr. Ladone, is married and has a child. ''They were young kids when this happened,'' Mr. Ladone's mother-in-law said recently. ''That was a long time ago. It's past history.''

All three men declined through their relatives or lawyers to be interviewed.

Defense lawyers maintained that the attack was not as clear-cut as it appeared to be. They recounted the fact that Mr. Grimes was carrying a knife on the night of the attack.

''The kids felt that these were three bad guys,'' Mr. Lester's lawyer, Bryan Levinson, recalled.

A month after the attack, Robert D. Riley, who was also charged in the attack and was awaiting the results of his application to become a police officer, agreed to testify against his friends. The son of a correction officer, he later moved with his family to California and became a salesman.

Christopher Griffith, a photojournalist who is Michael's brother, runs the Griffith-Sandiford Family Assistance Fund, which provides help to victims of hate crimes and those with AIDS. He said he would never return to the scene of the crime, not because he feared for his safety but because the memories remained too raw.

Mr. Sandiford never responded with a blanket condemnation of Howard Beach residents, nor does his widow.

''In whatever color there are good and bad,'' Mrs. Sandiford said. ''What happened is people make mistakes; they do wrong things. They took a part of my life away, but I don't hate them. I forgive them for what they did. I don't have to live with that - they had the hate, not me.''

Still, she has never visited the scene of the crime, either.

''To be truthful,'' she said, ''since Michael got killed, I never eat pizza.''

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

“What these guys are doing is very serious,” he said. “Israel has always been proud of protecting all of the holy sites. Today, when the Muslim world is where it is, to give them justification to attack Israel is a disaster, it’s crazy and it must stopped.”

One of the settler leaders, Danny Dayan, joined Mr. Peres in criticizing attacks on mosques, but put some responsibility on what he called “a trend of incitement” against Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

The Palestinian Authority described the mosque burnings as “hate crimes,” and in a statement called on the international community to hold the Israeli government responsible for the attacks.

On Wednesday, reacting to the attack on the Israeli base, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a set of steps to be applied to right-wing Israeli extremists. The measures include the use of detention without charge and trial through military courts.

Such methods had until now generally been restricted to treatment of Palestinian suspects. Some left-wing Israelis worried that the new steps would also be used against their activists in the West Bank. Other commentary on the new approach said the changes were insufficient because they failed to address the central issue — tolerance of the violence by rabbinic and other leaders.

Mr. Netanyahu decided not to label the Jewish extremists terrorists, which would have given still more powers to security forces.

Gilad Shalit from more than five years of captivity in Gaza. Unlike the first group of 477, this one includes no senior militants or members of either Hamas or Islamic Jihad.

Kraybill, an expert on the Amish at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania.

In at least four violent attacks over the last few months, groups of men from Mr. Mullet’s compound held men down to shear their beards with scissors and battery-operated clippers, according to the authorities. In one case, they said, several of Mr. Mullet’s nephews also hacked off the hair of their own mother — Mr. Mullet’s sister — who had fled the compound years earlier.

One victim told investigators that “he would prefer to have been beaten black and blue than to suffer the disfigurement and humiliation of having his hair removed,” according to the F.B.I. affidavit supporting the hate-crime charges. The attacks caused fear and bewilderment among the 60,000 Amish of Ohio, who are pacifists and reject the idea of revenge.

Former residents of Mr. Mullet’s compound said he exerted iron control over the settlement of 120, many of them his relatives, sometimes imprisoning men in a chicken coop for days or beating them. Former residents also said that Mr. Mullet had sex with married women in the community “to cleanse them of the devil,” according to the F.B.I. affidavit.

Mr. Mullet moved with some followers to an isolated valley near Bergholz in 1995 after conflicts with Amish leaders in another part of the state. He was ordained as a minister in 1997 and later as a bishop. But he fell out with other Amish bishops in eastern Ohio, who determined that his effort to excommunicate eight families that left his compound in 2005 was not justified.

Mr. Mullet has apparently nursed a grudge ever since, and the recent victims included bishops who opposed his excommunication decrees as well as people who aided those who fled from his community.

The federal affidavit provides details of four beard-cutting attacks and notes that the assailants took photographs of the victims to keep a record of their humiliation. It describes recorded telephone conversations between Mr. Mullet and some of those jailed in October, in which they discussed possible further beard-cutting reprisals against their Amish enemies.

“With the swastikas, with the K.K.K., all together it paints a very ugly picture,” Mr. Hikind said. “If it was only the swastikas, we would be upset. But when you add the violence, it adds another dimension. I don’t remember anything like it in the 29 years I’m in public office.”

The episode revived painful memories for many residents of Midwood, which Mr. Hikind said had one of the largest populations of Holocaust survivors of any city outside Israel. He added that he was thinking of his 90-year-old mother, who lives in Midwood and spent time in the Auschwitz concentration camp.

“The swastika to you and me is terrible,” he said. “A swastika to my mother brings back the worst memories imaginable. This community in particular, this is a beautiful community. We almost have no crime in this community. That this happens is extremely disturbing.”

Mr. Adams said the march sent the message that hate would not be tolerated in any part of the city.

“At one time people were using Magic Markers to scrawl hate on walls,” he said. “Now they are using gasoline to blow up vehicles in safe communities such as this. We want to match that aggression with the same amount of unity that we will not tolerate this and we will not accept this.”

The case involved comments made in July in which Mr. Malema and several of his lieutenants were accused of calling for the overthrow of the government of neighboring Botswana.

His expulsion from the party would represent a perilous political step, risking a loss of support among party veterans among the country’s disaffected young people, plagued by joblessness, who have backed the youth leader.

Mr. Malema has cast himself as the champion of those left out of South Africa’s post-apartheid economy, calling for nationalization of the mines that underpin much of the nation’s wealth.

The case has presented party leaders with delicate political challenge that could have a bearing on the A.N.C.’s internal leadership elections next year that will determine whether President Jacob Zuma is nominated for a second term in office — making him a virtual shoo-in because of the A.N.C.’s overwhelming political dominance.

“If Malema is seen to get off, he will be uncontrollable. As a result, the party will be ungovernable. And it could be the starting point of the alliance’s unraveling,” columnist Stephen Grootes wrote in the Daily Maverick news Web site.

Before the hearing, there had been a series of hints of leniency from the ruling elite.

On Tuesday, Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe said the governing party “abandons only the most incorrigible.”

“It has the confidence that it can correct its members. Even in the A.N.C., the philosophy is that people always can be corrected by undermining their weak points and supporting their strong points,” he said.

President Zuma was quoted as making similar remarks after the hate speech ruling in September.

“You cannot allow him to do the wrong things,” he said of Mr. Malema. ”In other words, the job of the A.N.C. is to help Malema, to mold him into a dynamic, good leader. That’s what we need to do. It is only if you can’t do it that the question becomes: what do we do with him?”",nytimes.com,True

The election night burning of a New England church became national news. A “This Land” column shared how the pastor’s father had left segregated Alabama, gathered together a congregation in Springfield, and bought an old downtown church to use as a house of worship; how his eldest son and successor, Bryant, worked for years to raise the money to build a new church on the city’s outskirts; and how, when it burned down, he just knew that racism had fueled the fire.

Now, sitting in a pew, Bishop Robinson referred to another part of family history. How, in Emelle, Ala., on July 4, 1930, his grandfather and uncles found themselves in an argument with a white store owner over a car battery. How that dispute escalated into a violent, hate-filled mob scene that left several dead, white and black, including a pregnant black woman and the bishop’s Uncle Esau — who was lynched.

So, you see, Bishop Robinson just knew.

Two months after the fire, three white men in their 20s were charged with burning down the church to express their rage at the thought of a black president. Two pleaded guilty, and the third was convicted after trial, in a case that The Republican newspaper of Springfield described as a “blot on the whole city.”

“Unfortunately, it was a confirmation of my experiences as an African-American,” Bishop Robinson said, adding: “My faith teaches me to forgive, and I forgive them. But I cannot be accepting of their behavior. I cannot be victimized by hatred. So I have to move forward.”

In moving forward, he and his congregation of a few hundred found outstretched hands. Donations arrived from around the country, while volunteers cleared the debris and carted away the ruined foundation. But the journey had its peaks and valleys.

For example, its leaders applied for federal assistance under the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996, which was enacted after a spate of house-of-worship burnings. They filled out a checklist that asked, with bureaucratic bluntness, what the arson had destroyed:

Sanctuary (yes). Choir seating (yes). Fellowship hall (yes). Pastor’s office (yes).

The Macedonia church eventually won the very last government loan guarantee available under the law, which was good. But it had trouble securing a loan for the government to back, which was bad.

That is, until Gov. Deval Patrick addressed the Urban League of Springfield in February 2010. He explained that the church had just learned that day that its bank was not inclined to provide a vital construction loan, even though the church had already paid off the loan related to its first attempt at a new home.

“I know that in this audience tonight are people who care about Macedonia,” Mr. Patrick had said. “Are people who understand we need this church to rise as a symbol that hate doesn’t win. And I know that there are people here who are in the finance field or know people who are, who can rally to help this very, very worthy cause.”

Soon the church had the $1.8 million bank loan it needed. And construction began in earnest.

Along the way, a group called the National Coalition for Burned Churches offered rotating teams of volunteers. Here came some Catholics from suburban Chicago. Here came some Methodists and Jews from Northern California. Here came some students from Harvard, and some Congregationalists from the town of Millbury.

A few of these volunteers left behind handwritten messages on the walls concealed by the church hallway’s dropped ceiling — a form of spiritual graffiti, you might say. “His love endures forever.” “May God dwell in this house forever.”

There is still work to do; the landscaping, for example, will have to wait until spring. And the need to pay for everything remains; the church, Bishop Robinson admits, is in perpetual fund-raising mode. No matter: what has risen is a large, simple structure of wonder.

A sanctuary — yes — with 60 wooden pews purchased from a North Carolina business called Affordable Church Furniture. Choir seating — yes — with many of the chairs donated by a Lutheran church. A fellowship hall — yes — with more than enough room for wedding receptions and funeral repasts.

And — yes— a pastor’s office, on the very spot where gasoline was poured on that hopeful, horrible November night. “The guys came from those woods,” Bradford Martin Jr., the church’s indefatigable lawyer, said as he led a tour through the building. “They busted in here. They splashed it on the outside and they splashed it on the inside.”

On Saturday’s misty morning, members of the Macedonia congregation gathered in their new home for a rousing dedication. Dressed in their finest, they prayed and sang and swayed.

Here was the governor of Massachusetts, and the mayor of Springfield, and a police officer who worked on the arson investigation, and, all the way from California, Charles E. Blake Sr., the presiding bishop and chief apostle of the Church of God in Christ.

Mr. Malema had argued that the song was not a literal incitement to murder, but a symbolic rallying cry to dismantle apartheid. The judgment effectively outlawed the disputed refrain.

“I find the words uttered by Malema constitute hate speech,” Judge Lamont said, drawing assertions from other Youth League leaders that the ruling criminalized much of the heritage of the A.N.C. as the leading force against apartheid. The finding did not carry a criminal penalty, but Mr. Malema was ordered to pay court costs. It was unclear whether he planned to appeal.

“The words of one person inciting others,” Judge Lamont said, according to South African news reports, “that’s how a genocide can start.” He added, “No justification exists allowing the words to be sung.

“People must develop new customs and rejoice in a developing society by giving up old practices which are hurtful to members who live in that society with them,” Judge Lamont said.

Judge Lamont determined that while songs like “Shoot the Boer” were part of the fight against white minority rule, they constituted hate speech as South Africa seeks to heal its racial past.

The pro-Malema crowd was smaller than a gathering of young people who fought with the police last month when the A.N.C. opened a formal inquiry to determine whether the youth leader had brought the party into disrepute and sowed division by advocating the overthrow of the government in neighboring Botswana.

The inquiry is politically charged because Mr. Malema, who helped President Zuma win a power struggle within the party in 2007, is now at odds with him. While Mr. Malema is not generally seen as a direct challenger for the party leadership, the Youth League could disrupt Mr. Zuma’s bid next year for a second term as party leader — a position that, if secured, would automatically make him the favored presidential candidate in elections in 2014.

The reactions to the ruling by Judge Lamont showed the breadth of the racial gap. The Youth League secretary general, Sindiso Magaqa, said the verdict effectively outlawed commemorations of the struggle that ended apartheid. But Kallie Kriel, the head of an Afrikaans civil right group, said it showed that Mr. Malema’s behavior polarized South Africa’s racial groups, once separated by law under apartheid.

According to its charter, the A.N.C. is formally opposed to racial distinctions and seeks a non-racial society. But “Shoot the Boer,” Mr. Kriel said, showed the power of “another A.N.C. where reconciliation is not top of the agenda.”",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Dedmon, 19, is being held without bond. A preliminary hearing set for Tuesday was postponed. He has said that Mr. Anderson’s death was an accident. John A. Rice, 18, who was in a second car, is charged with assault and has been released on bond.

Mr. Anderson, 48, died shortly after 5 a.m. on June 26. He had been leaving a motel, and had either lost his keys or locked them in his truck, the police said. Images from a security video show two carloads of teenagers driving into the parking lot. Some of them jumped out and approached Mr. Anderson, who was beaten and robbed. As Mr. Anderson staggered along a grassy strip at the edge of a parking lot, a teenager driving a Ford pickup truck backed up and then accelerated forward, running over and killing him, the investigators said.

The lawsuit makes public for the first time the names of all seven people who had piled into the two vehicles that night, charging that while some were directly responsible for assaulting and killing Mr. Anderson, others were negligent because they acted as lookouts and did not try to help Mr. Anderson.

Mr. Smith has said he intends to prosecute the case as a hate crime, which comes into play during the sentencing phase. If Mr. Dedmon is convicted of capital murder and the prosecutors can prove that the crime was committed because of the victim’s race, the sentence may be doubled. The prosecutors have not decided whether to seek the death penalty for Mr. Dedmon.

The victim’s family has created the James Craig Anderson Foundation for Racial Tolerance, but has not spoken much publicly about Mr. Anderson’s death. In an interview with The New York Times last month, family members described Mr. Anderson as a good country cook, a gifted gardener and always genial. They said he liked his job on the assembly line at the Nissan plant, which he had held for about seven years.

“If you met him, the first thing you were going to see was that grand-piano smile,” said his eldest sister, Barbara Anderson Young, who is one of the plaintiffs.

James Bradfield, Mr. Anderson’s partner of 17 years, is not a plaintiff. Under Mississippi law, same-sex partners have no claim in civil actions like this, Mr. Dees said.

“There still is that component of our culture that very much likes to hold on to how things have been in the past,” he said. “That group, however, doesn’t represent the broader cross section of people who are good and honest but perhaps too naïve, perhaps too quiet, too complacent in looking at racism.”

Then, one car drove off. But an F-250 pick-up — driven by Mr. Dedmon, the prosecutor said — pulled out of the parking lot and ran over Mr. Anderson as he staggered along the lot’s edge.

“I don’t think there are aggressive gangs out there beating up black people,” Mr. Smith said. “I do think because of the political and economic structure and the re-engineering of society, it appears that certain parts of the country and Mississippi feel their culture is under attack.”

For Mr. Bradfield and Mr. Anderson’s siblings, the case is nothing but a hate crime. Jackson, for its part, has been slow to publicly address the case. Mayor Harvey Johnson, who is black, issued his first public statement on the matter last week. A public vigil was held on Aug. 14. A few hundred people marched from a nearby church to the motel parking lot and placed a wreath on the grassy spot near the curb where Mr. Anderson was hit.

Perhaps interest in the case was muted, people close to the family and in the community said, because Mr. Anderson’s family had been slow to come forward.

Although the family has created the James Craig Anderson Foundation for Racial Tolerance, they wanted to protect themselves from the media scrum and political opportunism that would surely come from a fist-pounding demand for justice, said Mr. Thompson, the lawyer. Mr. Anderson’s family and others wonder why only two of the seven teenagers were charged. And perhaps the toughest question of all: Could such a potent strain of racism exist in a city that has worked for decades to overcome it?

“The Help,” a film that explores the relationships between black maids and their white employers in the 1960s, sold out several shows during its debut weekend here.

“He is not a racist or a murderer,” Lisa Smith Seale Erwin, his great-aunt, posted on the page. “If anything, he is being tried by the media, suffering from reverse racism and placed in jail without bond. I am sick of the race card.”

Mr. Rice has since been released on bail.

That such a crime might have happened in a state whose history is laced with racially motivated crimes does not surprise Winston Thompson III, a lawyer who is working with Mr. Anderson’s family. Both Mr. Thompson and prosecutors are interviewing other teenagers and studying Facebook and other social media sites, trying to determine if the case is an isolated incident or part of a more deliberate effort to single out African-Americans for violence.

The mayor simply said that federal prosecutors “don’t take all the cases”; the commissioner noted that federal authorities have the right of first refusal, but that this case had actually started as a criminal matter and “morphed” into a terrorism inquiry; and Mr. Vance said his office focused on “local, unaffiliated threats.”

The F.B.I., which oversees the Joint Terrorist Task Force, whose agents and police detectives generally investigate such matters, declined to pursue the case and have said little about it. Federal prosecutors, apparently, were not consulted.

On Wednesday, after the defendants were arraigned on the indictment, a lawyer for one of them suggested that the investigation had continued because of politics and a desire to grandstand.

“I think you’re going to see that this case is a case based on the financial, political and personal ambitions of the police commissioner of the City of New York, the mayor of the City of New York and the district attorney of New York County,” said Elizabeth Fink, who represents the lead defendant, Ahmed Ferhani.

But Mr. Vance, in a statement, said the indictment highlighted how the defendants’ “desire to commit violent Jihad against Jewish Americans is not only an act of terrorism, but a hate crime.”

Despite the absence of the most sensational charges, the men were nonetheless arraigned on serious felonies under the state’s terrorism law, for which they could face up to 25 years in prison if they are convicted. Had the top counts been included in the indictment, the men would have faced mandatory life sentences if convicted. The law, passed after the Sept. 11 attacks, has never been used in such a case.

Mr. Ferhani, 26, and his co-defendant, Mohamed Mamdouh, 20, pleaded not guilty at the hearing in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Ms. Fink asked Justice Michael J. Obus to appoint a forensic psychiatrist to evaluate her client’s mental condition.

After the arraignment, Ms. Fink called the case “bogus” and told reporters that Mr. Ferhani had a long history of mental illness.

Another lawyer representing him, Lamis Deek, said that Mr. Ferhani had been hospitalized 20 to 30 times in the past 10 to 15 years and had been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital by the Police Department. Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman, said in a statement that the department does not commit people, but may sometimes transport those who appear emotionally disturbed for evaluation at a psychiatric hospital, and has no say over whether the person is admitted.

“Even so, should that leave the police powerless from interrupting a plot to blow up a synagogue and to shoot and kill Jews in New York City?” he asked, adding, “Don’t think so.”

Mr. Ferhani’s mental history could have a significant impact on the prosecution’s case, which grew out of a sting operation in which undercover police detectives with the Intelligence Division sold guns and a hand grenade to the men. Mr. Ferhani’s lawyers said they intended to pursue an entrapment defense.

At the arraignment, Aaron Mysliwiec, the lawyer for Mr. Mamdouh, underscored the grand jury’s failure to include the top counts, saying, “The charges have dropped a significant level here in this case.”

Mr. Rottenberg’s lawyer, Michael Sussman, requested a federal hate-crime investigation in a May 26 letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.

Mr. Sussman said officials in the town of Ramapo, where New Square is located, had long been intimidated by the Hasidic community’s often-unanimous bloc vote, leaving them unwilling to investigate leaders of the community.

The attack, Mr. Sussman wrote, “was not just an isolated incident against one particular family.”

“Rather,” he continued, “it illustrates a systemic crisis of religious bigotry and intolerance” in New Square and similar Hasidic communities. He said he planned to file suit this week against the village leadership.

Ramapo police officials said Friday that they were working with F.B.I. agents in the investigation.

Grand Rabbi Twersky, 70, who has led New Square, and Skverer Hasidim worldwide, since his father died in April 1968, issued a statement four days after the attack in which he said he was praying for Mr. Rottenberg’s recovery.

“We condemn in the strongest possible terms the use of violence under any circumstances,” he said.

The Rottenberg family had recently installed surveillance cameras, out of fear of attacks and harassment. Mr. Rottenberg’s eldest son, Jacob, was monitoring the cameras around 4 a.m. on May 22 when he saw at least one intruder placing gasoline-soaked rags behind the house. Screaming, he awoke his father, who ran outside only to have the gasoline explode and set him afire.

Mr. Spitzer was ordered held on $300,000 bail during his arraignment at the burn unit of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, where he has been treated for burns to his arms and hands.

Initially, local officials played down the attack. Peter Brower, Ramapo’s police chief, said there was no evidence linking it to previous incidents. The town supervisor, Christopher St. Lawrence, who was re-elected in 2009 with the support of virtually all of New Square’s 2,000 voters, said he had conferred with the deputy mayor of New Square, Israel Spitzer, and was assured that the attack was an isolated event. The suspect is Mr. Spitzer’s cousin.

But police records show that the Rottenberg family had reported increasing threats and attacks since mid-September, when Mr. Rottenberg and some friends began praying at the residence for the elderly. Mr. Rottenberg has since said he started to do so because a friend there was being treated for cancer.

The Journal News, a newspaper Mr. Rottenberg visited in November, saying he feared for his safety, reported Sunday that violence in the community was the result of gangs of young zealots intent on supporting the rabbi.

Mr. St. Lawrence did not respond to phone calls on Friday.

A county legislator, Joe Meyers, called for a federal investigation and criticized Mr. St. Lawrence’s response. He said there were indications of a concerted effort “to intimidate Mr. Rottenberg and to effectively deny him his legal right to worship where he pleases.”

Mr. Ravi has been accused of setting up a webcam on Sept. 19, 2010, to view Mr. Clementi without his knowledge, then going to the room of Ms. Wei to turn the camera on remotely and watch. Ms. Wei and Mr. Ravi were high school friends from Plainsboro, N.J., and lived in the same dorm at Rutgers.

I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.” He is accused of setting up the camera again two days later, and urging others to watch.

Posts on a gay chat site, believed to be by Mr. Clementi, show that he learned of the spying and decided to report it to a resident adviser. “I feel like it was ‘look at what a fag my roommate is,’ ” he wrote on Sept. 21, adding that Mr. Ravi’s friends seemed more upset about his having a gay roommate than about his spying.

After discovering that his roommate had spied on him, the authorities said, Mr. Clementi, an aspiring violinist from Ridgewood, N.J., jumped from the George Washington Bridge on Sept. 22.

Prosecutors said Wednesday that the events that led to the bias-intimidation charges dated from Aug. 6, the day Mr. Ravi learned the name of his future roommate — identified in the indictment as “T.C.,” since invasion of privacy is designated a sexual offense. Later that month, Mr. Ravi used his Twitter account to announce he had found out his roommate was gay.

These continuing hate crimes were laid bare at a valuable but barely noticed Senate hearing last week that provided welcome contrast to Representative Peter King’s airing of his xenophobic allegation that the Muslim-American community has been radicalized.

Offering federal data rather than mythic scapegoating of an easy political target, the Senate hearing focused on the fact that while Muslims make up 1 percent of the population, they are victims in 14 percent of religious discrimination cases. These range from homicides and mosque burnings to job, school and zoning law abuses, according to the Justice Department.

In running the hearing, Senator Richard Durbin tried to set the record straight about the patriotism of a vast majority of American-Muslim citizens and the continuing assaults on their civil rights. He warned against the “guilt by association” whipped up by Mr. King’s broadsides — that there are “too many mosques” in the nation, that most of them are extremist, and that American Muslim leaders have failed to cooperate with law enforcement against home-grown terrorism.

It was former President George W. Bush who first warned against turning on Muslim Americans after Sept. 11, 2001, stressing the fact that Islam is “a faith based upon love, not hate,” regardless of the religious veneer the fanatics of 9/11 tried to attach to their atrocities. Since then, American Muslims have served as the largest source of tips to authorities tracking terror suspects, according to a recent university study.

The Senate hearing was not designed as a full refutation of Representative King’s wild thesis, but it put a more human and factual face on a community that has been badly slurred. Mr. King is promising more committee haymakers. This is unfortunate. At least Mr. Durbin’s hearing made clear that the nation’s struggle against terrorism is best served by information, not dark generalizations.",nytimes.com,True

One of the most widely publicized cases came in December, in the wake of the fatal shooting an ethnic Russian soccer fan here by a man from Russia’s North Caucasus region. Thousands of young people began an extended riot close to Red Square, chanting “Russia for Russians” and racial slurs. They threw rocks at police officers, and then scattered. Later, groups of ethnic Russian men and some women attacked non-Slavic minorities on side streets and subways. Several people were reported killed.

Ethnic Russians make up about 80 percent of Russia’s 142 million people, sharing the country with more than 100 ethnic groups, many of which make up Russia’s large Muslim community. Russia also has the largest immigrant population in the world after the United States, numbering as many as 10 million, mostly from former Soviet republics in the South Caucasus and Central Asia.

Nationalists have taken responsibility for kidnappings, beheadings and a 2006 bombing that killed 10 at a Moscow market operated mostly by immigrants. At least 37 people were killed and more than 300 injured in xenophobic attacks in 2010, according to the Sova Center, a Moscow-based organization that tracks such violence. Many more cases go unreported.

Nationalists have also singled out those considered sympathetic to ethnic minorities or opposed to right-wing ideas and deeds. They have killed several members of an anti-fascist group called Anti-Fa, which arose in response to growing xenophobic violence. In the past year, nationalists have been linked to the murders of several police officers and a judge.

Aleksandr Belov, a nationalist leader who once worked with Mr. Tikhonov, blamed the government for the recent violence, saying Russia’s leaders ignored the interests of ethnic Russians, favoring well-organized and influential diasporas while squeezing nationalists out of power. This, he said, has prompted some to take up arms to stave off perceived threats against Russia’s culture and traditions.

“It is becoming an armed struggle,” Mr. Belov said. “You can call such people terrorists, but there is another name: these are partisans who are fighting a war of liberation.”

Based on testimony from Mr. Tikhonov’s friends, prosecutors contend that he considered himself a part of this struggle.

“In conversations, he expressed intolerance toward immigrants in Russia and non-Slavs, and expressed racist ideas,” a friend, Sergei Yerzunov, also an avowed nationalist, told investigators, according to court documents. “He said that the main goal, not only of his activities, but of the whole nationalist movement, should be the struggle against ideological opponents.”

Mr. Tikhonov is accused of killing two such enemies. One, Stanislav Markelov, a lawyer, for years pressed the authorities to have perpetrators of hate crimes brought up on charges, leading to the imprisonment of several. The other, Anastasia Baburova, a freelance journalist with Novaya Gazeta, the country’s leading opposition newspaper, wrote about nationalists.

They were shot to death together at close range in January 2009 in a brazen, daylight attack just a short walk from the Kremlin. Prosecutors have charged Mr. Tikhonov’s common-law wife, Yevgenia Khasis, with aiding the attack, and she is also now on trial.

The killings were met with satisfaction if not outright jubilation in some nationalist circles. One nationalist carried Champagne to a makeshift memorial a day after the shootings, placing the bottle amid the flowers in the still-red snow.

Investigators say that Mr. Markelov was the intended target. His investigation into the 2006 stabbing death of an anti-fascist activist led to Mr. Tikhonov being named a suspect. Though Mr. Tikhonov denied involvement — and prosecutors later dropped the charges against him — he fled.

For three years he lay low in a rented Moscow apartment. Using an alias and fake documents, he left Russia for a time, possibly living in Ukraine, friends and relatives said. He used pay phones to make sporadic calls, though he avoided revealing his whereabouts.

His lawyer, Aleksandr Vasilyev, said Mr. Tikhonov made a living selling weapons on the black market. The police discovered an arsenal stashed in his apartment upon his arrest in November 2009; among the weapons confiscated was the Browning pistol used to shoot Mr. Markelov and Ms. Baburova.

Despite the evidence against Mr. Tikhonov, his family and friends contend that he is innocent, describing him as a convenient suspect because of his earlier ties to Mr. Markelov, but ultimately the victim of a government crackdown on nationalists.

Though nationalists tend to portray themselves as oppressed, the government’s treatment of them has been more ambivalent. While Russia’s leaders have vehemently condemned xenophobic violence, they also have at times seemed to try to co-opt nationalist sentiment.

The Kremlin has allowed right-wing groups to hold rallies in Moscow, where participants have made Nazi salutes, even as it blocks protests by the liberal opposition.

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/weekinreview/30gettleman.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"NAIROBI, Kenya — It was late at night and totally dark when I first met David Kato. He had been described to me as “the most out” gay Ugandan and the country’s leading gay rights crusader, reviled by many, revered by a small few — but definitely well known. So I was a bit surprised when he suggested that we conduct our interview in an empty lot behind a disco, down a dark gravel road.

“I’m really sorry about this,” he said to me, sitting just a few feet away but barely visible. “This is Uganda, after all.”

At the time, December 2009, Uganda’s Parliament was considering whether gay people should be executed. A Ugandan politician had crafted legislation, the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, after a visit from American evangelicals who advocated a program to “cure” homosexuality. The evangelicals later disavowed any intent to inspire the bill.

In fact, as soon as it was put forward, many human rights groups were forecasting what would happen next. They said that just the notion of the government’s seriously considering the death penalty for gay people would spur lynch mobs and spell open season on Uganda’s gays.

Last October, a Ugandan newspaper published a diatribe against homosexuals with Mr. Kato’s picture, and another, on the front page under the words: “Hang Them.” On Wednesday, he was attacked in his home during the day and beaten to death with a hammer. The police called it a robbery. Mr. Kato’s friends were emphatic: He was killed because he was gay.

However the investigation turns out, Mr. Kato felt certain that he had placed himself at terrible risk. That’s why we met in a vacant lot. That night he told me about his life — how he had gone to Uganda’s best schools, had become a teacher and had lived for several years in South Africa, one of the most progressive countries on the continent.

So I asked him the obvious.

Why come back to Uganda?

“We are few people who are out here,” he said. “Me, I’m a professional teacher, I went to nice schools. My role is to fight and liberate.”

He was a small man with thick glasses and thin wrists. He said police officers had broken his arm and cracked him in the nose after he held Uganda’s first gay rights news conference several years ago. He talked fast, constantly scanning the darkness. He struck me as clearly brave and deeply frightened.

Uganda, which Winston Churchill famously called the “pearl of Africa,” doesn’t feel like an especially intolerant place. Most people here seem free to say what they want, even regarding President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power 25 years straight.

But beneath the mild surface is an intensely strong current of religion. And in March 2009, the American evangelicals came to Uganda to discuss what they called “the gay agenda — that whole hidden and dark agenda,” and to assert that gay men often sodomized teenage boys.

Many Ugandans have told me that gay people, historically, had been tolerated in their villages. Perhaps they were looked at a little differently, but they were not viewed as a threat. But now, that had changed.

The Rev. Kapya Kaoma, a Zambian who attended the antigay meetings, said the Americans had underestimated the homophobia. “They didn’t know that when you speak about destroying the family to Africans, the response is a genocide,” he said. “The moment you speak about the family, you speak about the tribe, you speak about the future. Africans will fight to the death. When you speak like that, you invite the wrath.”

Don Schmierer, one of the evangelicals who visited in 2009, called Mr. Kato’s death “horrible” and said, “Naturally, I don’t want anyone killed, but I don’t feel I had anything to do with that.” He added, “I don’t spread hate.”

On Friday, Mr. Kato was buried in his home village. Several hundred attended, including a priest who told the mourners to repent. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill is still being discussed and may become law this year.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/world/europe/30britain.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"LONDON — A 29-year-old Ugandan woman who says she is a lesbian won a last-minute stay of deportation on Friday night from a British High Court judge who heard her lawyers plead that her life would be at risk if she was forced to return to her homeland.

The judge’s ruling came after Brenda Namigadde, who came to Britain as a student in 2003, had been taken from an immigration detention center outside London to Heathrow Airport ahead of a flight to Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Her lawyer said she had already boarded the flight when immigration officials were notified of the judge’s ruling and then escorted Ms. Namigadde off the aircraft and returned her to the detention center.

Appeals and protests on Ms. Namigadde’s behalf intensified in the past 48 hours after the most outspoken gay rights advocate in Uganda, David Kato, was beaten to death on Wednesday with a hammer at his home outside Kampala. In October, a Kampala tabloid newspaper, Rolling Stone, ran an angry diatribe identifying 100 individuals it described as “Uganda’s top homos.” The article was accompanied by a front-page picture of Mr. Kato and a banner saying, “Hang Them.”

The Ugandan police, who have arrested one man in the killing and are pursuing another, said to have been living with Mr. Kato, have said that the motive for the killing was robbery and that it was not prompted by his campaign on behalf of homosexuals.

Long before the killing of Mr. Kato, Ms. Namigadde had become an icon for a global network of human rights activists and campaigners for gay and lesbian rights. In the years that her case has been before British courts, they have depicted it as a landmark in the fight to secure the rights of homosexuals around the world, including the right of asylum outside their homelands for citizens of countries that persecute homosexuals.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/africa/28uganda.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"As the most outspoken gay rights advocate in Uganda, a country where homophobia is so severe that Parliament is considering a bill to execute gay people, Mr. Kato had received a stream of death threats, his friends said. A few months ago, a Ugandan newspaper ran an antigay diatribe with Mr. Kato’s picture on the front page under a banner urging, “Hang Them.”

On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Kato was beaten to death with a hammer in his rough-and-tumble neighborhood. Police officials were quick to chalk up the motive to robbery, but members of the small and increasingly besieged gay community in Uganda suspect otherwise.

“David’s death is a result of the hatred planted in Uganda by U.S. evangelicals in 2009,” Val Kalende, the chairwoman of one of Uganda’s gay rights groups, said in a statement. “The Ugandan government and the so-called U.S. evangelicals must take responsibility for David’s blood.”

Ms. Kalende was referring to visits in March 2009 by a group of American evangelicals, who held rallies and workshops in Uganda discussing how to turn gay people straight, how gay men sodomized teenage boys and how “the gay movement is an evil institution” intended to “defeat the marriage-based society.”

The Americans involved said they had no intention of stoking a violent reaction. But the antigay bill was drafted shortly thereafter. Some of the Ugandan politicians and preachers who wrote it had attended those sessions and said that they had discussed the legislation with the Americans.

After growing international pressure and threats from a few European countries to cut assistance — Uganda relies on hundreds of millions of dollars of aid — Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, indicated that the bill would be scrapped.

But more than a year later, that has not happened, and the legislation remains a simmering issue in Parliament. Some political analysts say the bill could be passed in the coming months, after a general election in February that is expected to return Mr. Museveni, who has been in office for 25 years, to power.

On Thursday, Don Schmierer, one of the American evangelicals who visited Uganda in 2009, said Mr. Kato’s death was “horrible.”

“Naturally, I don’t want anyone killed, but I don’t feel I had anything to do with that,” said Mr. Schmierer, who added that in Uganda he had focused on parenting skills. He also said that he had been a target of threats himself, recently receiving more than 600 messages of hate mail related to his visit.

“I spoke to help people,” he said, “and I’m getting bludgeoned from one end to the other.”

Many Africans view homosexuality as an immoral Western import, and the continent is full of harsh homophobic laws. In northern Nigeria, gay men can face death by stoning. In Kenya, which is considered one of the more Westernized nations in Africa, gay people can be sentenced to years in prison.

But Uganda seems to be on the front lines of this battle. Conservative Christian groups that espouse antigay beliefs have made great headway in this country and wield considerable influence. Uganda’s minister of ethics and integrity, James Nsaba Buturo, who describes himself as a devout Christian, has said, “Homosexuals can forget about human rights.”

At the same time, American groups that defend gay rights have also poured money into Uganda to help the beleaguered gay community.

In October, a Ugandan newspaper called Rolling Stone (with a circulation of roughly 2,000 and no connection to the American magazine) published an article that included photos and the whereabouts of gay men and lesbians, including several well-known activists like Mr. Kato.

The paper said homosexuals were raiding schools and recruiting children, a belief that is quite widespread in Uganda and has helped drive the homophobia.

Mr. Kato and a few other activists sued the paper and won. This month, Uganda’s High Court ordered Rolling Stone to pay hundreds of dollars in damages and to cease publishing the names of people it said were gay.

But the danger remained.

“I had to move houses,” said Stosh Mugisha, a woman who is going through a transition to become a man. “People tried to stone me. It’s so scary. And it’s getting worse.”

On Thursday, Giles Muhame, Rolling Stone’s managing editor, said he did not think that Mr. Kato’s killing had anything to do with what his paper had published.

“There is no need for anxiety or for hype,” he said. “We should not overblow the death of one.”

But that one man was considered a founding father of Uganda’s nascent gay rights movement. In an interview in 2009, Mr. Kato shared his life story, how he was raised in a conservative family where “we grew up brainwashed that it was wrong to be in love with a man.”

He was a high school teacher who had graduated from some of Uganda’s best schools, and he moved to South Africa in the mid-1990s, where he came out. A few years ago, he organized what he claimed was Uganda’s first gay rights news conference in Kampala, the capital, and said he was punched in the face and cracked in the nose by police officers soon afterward.

Friends said that Mr. Kato had recently put an alarm system in his house and was killed by an acquaintance, someone who had been inside several times before and was seen by neighbors on Wednesday. Mr. Kato’s neighborhood on the outskirts of Kampala is known as a rough one, where several people have recently been beaten to death with iron bars.

Judith Nabakooba, a police spokeswoman, said Mr. Kato’s death did not appear to be a hate crime, though the investigation had just started. “It looks like theft, as some things were stolen,” Ms. Nabakooba said.

But Nikki Mawanda, a friend who was born female and lives as a man, said: “This is a clear signal. You don’t know who’s going to do it to you.”

Mr. Kato was in his mid-40s, his friends said. He was a fast talker, fidgety, bespectacled, slightly built and constantly checking over his shoulder, even in the envelope of darkness of an empty lot near a disco, where he was interviewed in 2009.

He said then that he wanted to be a “good human rights defender, not a dead one, but an alive one.”",nytimes.com,True

“Everything the government just told you about my client is absolute nonsense,” Mr. Nahas said.

The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which circulated a petition in 2009 calling for the Justice Department to bring federal charges in the case, welcomed the trial.

“This trial sends a strong message that hate crimes and those who attempt to cover them up, including law enforcement officers, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” said Gladys Limón, a staff lawyer for the fund.

Included in the indictment were accusations that Mr. Hayes, an investigating officer, had called Mr. Piekarsky’s mother and told her to tell the young men to “get their stories straight,” because Mr. Ramírez’s condition was deteriorating. He died in the hospital shortly after the beating.

The indictment also said that Mr. Moyer contacted the parents of one of the accused and told them to have their son throw away his sneakers, and that a Shenandoah official told the officers to recuse themselves from the case, but they refused.

To use a Sherlock Holmes aphorism, this was the case of the dog that did not bark. The deep significance of Xavier’s production of “Laramie” — of a Catholic school doing a play with an H.I.V.-positive, bar-going gay man as the object of the audience’s empathy — is that it stirred about as much controversy as, say, “Our Town.”

“I’m thrilled we did it,” Jack Raslowsky, Xavier’s president, said in an interview this week. “It’s one of those plays that has the potential to be a springboard to discussion. If you do ‘The Mousetrap’ or ‘Brigadoon,’ you’re not going to be discussing issues of good and evil.”

Such a discussion, said Mr. Raslowsky and Michael LiVigni, the headmaster, fits firmly in the Catholic theological tradition, with its emphases on social justice and human dignity.

“When I saw the play,” Mr. LiVigni said, “what struck me most was the scene of Matthew’s funeral when you have picketers with the sign ‘God Hates You.’ But why would God hate what he created? That’s what I want our boys to understand.”

The Xavier production serves as a kind of marker for all that has and has not changed in the dozen years since Mr. Shepard’s murder. With Congressional efforts to repeal the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy and a federal court case in California framing same-sex marriage as a civil right, society is moving toward fuller acceptance, if not yet complete equality, for gay citizens.

Yet in the months after Xavier began work on “Laramie,” a series of young gay teenagers across the country committed suicide to escape harassment, and a gay man and two teenagers in the Bronx were held, beaten and tortured in an incident widely likened to the Shepard killing.

The Roman Catholic Church, especially in the United States, has dealt with its own complicated duality on gay issues. On the inclusive side, a 1997 letter by American bishops entitled “Always Our Children” said that homosexuality could not be “considered sinful” and that homosexuals should not be pushed into therapy to try to change them. While calling on homosexuals to remain chaste, the letter maintained, “God does not love someone any less simply because he or she is homosexual.”

On the other flank, however, a 1986 letter from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, prepared when Pope Benedict was its leader, described homosexuality as a “more or less strong tendency toward an intrinsic moral evil.” And over the years, America’s bishops have formally campaigned against both same-sex marriage and civil unions.

“The debate within the church is whether to view innate attraction to the same sex as a deformity of human nature or as an alternative form of human sexual nature,” said Prof. Lisa Sowle Cahill, a professor of Christian ethics at Boston College. “Statistics show that younger religious people, including Catholics, are more accepting of gay people who are their peers. Nonetheless, in the culture you still see a lot of homophobia and hostility.”

What that means for students like Xavier’s can be distilled to a single, fashionable phrase of derision: “That’s so gay.” Adam Salazar, a 17-year-old senior from Brooklyn, knew it well; he used it often. “If someone was a loser, if someone was weird,” he recalled, “that was the word you used.”

Until reading the script of “Laramie” for his audition, though, Adam had never even heard of Matthew Shepard. He was in kindergarten, after all, the year of the murder. As he was cast last spring and rehearsed all this fall, he kept learning why the Shepard story still mattered.

“I was talking about what the new school play is,” he recalled of a conversation with classmates. “And I said, it’s about this homosexual kid who gets killed. And as soon as I said, ‘homosexual,’ their faces go pale.” He paused. “Just today, I heard a kid call another kid the f-word” — faggot — “because he didn’t give him a high-five.”

Marc Rugani, a religion teacher at Xavier, began discussing the play in his classes weeks before the performances. Initially, he felt the students were reticent “to breach this taboo topic.” After the show, that reluctance has given way to a “better understanding of the magnitude of hate.”

Angel Vicisio, a cast member, put it this way: “I’ve learned we are the generation that has a chance to change this.”

The immigrant, Marcelo Lucero, was surrounded and attacked by seven teenagers in a parking lot of a train station in Patchogue shortly before midnight on Nov. 8, 2008.

The mood has not subsided since. But in the final stretch of 2010, the radical right’s anger is becoming less focused, more free-floating — more likely to be aimed at “government” in general, whatever the location or officials in charge. The anger is also more likely to claim minorities like gays, Latinos and Muslims as collateral damage. This is a significant and understandable shift, if hardly a salutary one. The mad-as-hell crowd in America, still not seeing any solid economic recovery on the horizon, will lash out at any convenient scapegoat.

The rage was easier to parse at the Tea Party’s birth, when, a month after Obama’s inauguration, its founding father, CNBC’s Rick Santelli, directed his rant at the ordinary American “losers” (as he called them) defaulting on their mortgages, and at those in Washington who proposed bailing the losers out. (Funny how the Bush-initiated bank bailouts went unmentioned.) Soon enough, the anger tilted toward Washington in general and the new president in particular. And it kept getting hotter. In June 2009, still just six months into the Obama presidency, the Fox News anchor Shepard Smith broke with his own network’s party line to lament a rise in “amped up” Americans “taking the extra step and getting the gun out.” He viewed the killing of a guard by a neo-Nazi Obama hater at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington as the apotheosis of the “more and more frightening” post-election e-mail surging into Fox.

The moment passed. Glenn Beck, also on Fox, spoke for most on the right when he dismissed the shooter as a “lone gunman nutjob.” Those who showed up with assault rifles at presidential health care rallies that summer were similarly minimized as either solitary oddballs or overzealous Second Amendment patriots. Few cared when The Boston Globe reported last fall that the Secret Service was overwhelmed by death threats against the president as well as a rise in racist hate groups and antigovernment fervor. It’s no better now. In a cover article last month, Barton Gellman wrote in Time that the magazine’s six-month investigation found that “the threat level against the president and other government targets” is at its highest since the antigovernment frenzy that preceded Timothy McVeigh’s bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995.

Dana Milbank, a Washington Post columnist who has written a new book on Beck, has been tracking the case of Byron Williams, a bank robber on parole who injured two California Highway Patrol officers in a July shootout. Williams was out to start a revolution, his mother said, because “Congress was railroading through all these left-wing agenda items.” But instead of picking Congress as his target, Williams was gunning for progressives closer to home, at the Tides Foundation and A.C.L.U. in San Francisco. The Tides Foundation? It’s an obscure nonprofit whose agenda includes education and AIDS prevention. But it’s not obscure to Beck fans, who heard him single it out for vilification 29 times in the 18 months before Williams grabbed his gun.

As Milbank has written, “it’s not fair to blame Beck for violence committed by his fans,” but he would nonetheless “do well to stop encouraging extremists.” The same could be said of the many politicians who are emulating the Beck template — especially given the tinderbox state of the nation. Whether it’s Sarah Palin instructing her acolytes to “reload” or a congressman yelling “baby killer!” at a colleague on the House floor or Sharron Angle, the Tea Party senatorial candidate from Nevada, proposing that citizens consider “Second Amendment remedies” to “protect themselves against a tyrannical government,” we know where this can lead.

Even Paladino’s short, crumbling campaign can take credit for a share of the real-world damage in New York’s civil war over the “ground zero mosque” this summer. His television commercials calling the proposed Islamic center “a monument to those who attacked our country” helped push his primary campaign over the top, noticeably raising the city’s temperature. The fever peaked not quite three weeks after his ads first appeared, when a passenger slashed a New York cab driver in the face and throat simply because he was a Muslim.

Paladino’s fanning of Islamophobia was common among his national political brethren this summer. Equally common was the violence against Muslims and mosques that ensued, whether in Tennessee, Texas or California. Paladino’s antediluvian brand of homophobia is also making a comeback, from O’Donnell, who has called homosexuality an “identity disorder,” to Carly Fiorina, the Senate candidate in California whose campaign is allied with the National Organization for Marriage, notorious for its fear-mongering horror-movie ads portraying same-sex marriage as the apocalypse. Two weeks ago, Jim DeMint, the South Carolina senator who serves as the G.O.P.’s Tea Party kingmaker, reiterated his desire to ban openly gay schoolteachers. Michele Bachmann, Tea Party doyenne of the House, refused to condemn Paladino’s homophobia when asked about it last week on the “Today” show. As Stephen Colbert observed last week, after the G.O.P. repudiated a Congressional candidate in Ohio for wearing an SS uniform, the only line you can’t cross as a Republican is dressing as a Nazi. (Though, as Colbert added, “dressing the president as a Nazi” is O.K.)

Don’t expect the extremism and violence in our politics to subside magically after Election Day — no matter what the results. If Tea Party candidates triumph, they’ll be emboldened. If they lose, the anger and bitterness will grow. The only development that can change this equation is a decisive rescue from our prolonged economic crisis. Not for the first time in history — and not just American history — fear itself is at the root of a rabid outbreak of populist rage against government, minorities and conspiratorial “elites.”

So far neither party has offered a comprehensive antidote to our economic pain. The Democrats have fallen short, and the cynics leading the G.O.P. haven’t so much as tried. We shouldn’t be surprised that this year even a state as seemingly well-mannered as Connecticut has produced a senatorial candidate best known for marching into a wrestling ring to gratuitously kick a man in the groin.",nytimes.com,True

The Department of Education reported 862 incidents of harassment based on sexual orientation in the 2008-9 school year. More than 40 percent of the 1,700 homeless youths in the Safe Horizon Streetwork Project, a citywide victims’ assistance program, identify themselves as gay or transgender.

But in dozens of interviews this week, gay and lesbian residents said it could be especially difficult to be gay in the Bronx, given the macho culture of the street, the local gang codes and the storefront churches that call homosexuality a sin.

“If I walk around wearing tight jeans and looking non-hood, I feel the tension,” said Ruben Porras, 29, who grew up in Morris Heights, where the attacks occurred. “If I’m walking by some Bloods, I’ll walk tougher.

“But if I’m in Chelsea,” he said with a laugh, “I’ll act very differently.”

If the Bronx has no Chelsea, a Manhattan neighborhood that wears its gay identity proudly, it does have its public gay life. Some bars sponsor gay nights — Tuesdays at Mi Gente Café on Unionport Road are popular — but the scene is scattered, without the security that an enclave like Chelsea or the West Village provides.

“It’s loose and it’s not centralized, but there is a gay community in the Bronx,” said Mr. Rice-Gonzalez, whose theater acts as something of a clearinghouse for gay culture in the borough.

When Mr. Rice-Gonzalez was growing up in the Soundview neighborhood in the 1970s and ’80s, there were few gay organizations, making for “a very clear sense of isolation,” he said.

“There wasn’t a queer voice in the Bronx,” Mr. Rice-Gonzalez said. “There was no way for gay men to meet each other unless you ran into someone downtown.”

Today, several groups offer services and counseling to gay people, including the Bronx Community Pride Center, Bronx AIDS Services and the Hispanic AIDS Forum. Harassment and even violence against gays are not uncommon, but the Oct. 3 attacks in Morris Heights have struck a nerve because of their brutality and extent — 11 suspects; 4 victims, including the brother of one of the men who were tortured; and a 20-hour rampage involving cigarette burns, sodomy and beatings with baseball bats.

Mr. Porras, who said he knew some of the men arrested, offered an explanation of the attacks informed by life on those same streets. He said the men, who belonged to the Latin King Goonies, a subset of the Latin Kings, were not overtly hostile to gays. He compared the gang to a father who tolerated gay people — as long as they were not in his family.

“People will embrace it so long as it’s not someone they are claiming as their own,” he said.

The trouble began, the authorities said, after one gang member saw a 30-year-old man, who was suspected of being gay, with a 17-year-old who wanted to join the group. Gang members assumed the men had slept together; they punished them, another teenager and the older man’s brother.

Morris Heights is a tight-knit community where neighbors know one another by nicknames. Old men stand in bodegas discussing the day’s headlines. On a recent afternoon, young men on Burnside Avenue argued about the price a chop shop would pay for a Toyota.

A 29-year-old mother stood outside a bodega, two blocks from the house where the attacks occurred, reading newspaper accounts of the arrests. She said she was horrified by the violence, but she acknowledged that gay people, including a man in her building, made her uncomfortable.

Yet her feelings about homosexuality are conflicted, which gay advocates say is not unusual. “I watch a lot of gay porn,” she said. “It’s very intriguing to me. Why are they so interested? What pleasure do they get?”

In neighborhoods where gangs are common, some churches offer a message of tolerance. But several gay residents said a growing number of congregations made them feel attacked from two sides.

State Senator Rubén Díaz Sr., a Pentecostal minister who represents the South Bronx, is a vocal opponent of gay marriage. Many gay leaders noted that the statement he released condemning the recent attacks made no mention of homosexuality.

In an interview, Mr. Díaz, a Democrat, said: “I don’t support violence against anybody. I would ask for the maximum penalty to anyone that abuses another human being.” But he added, “I’m against gay marriage, and I always will be.”

New York has long been a refuge for gay people. But many have been dismayed by an assault this month on a gay man at the landmark Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, followed by the Bronx attacks and remarks this week by the Republican nominee for governor, Carl P. Paladino, who said gay pride parades were “disgusting.”

The suspect, Luis Garcia, 26, was arrested at his home at 1900 Hennessy Place in the Bronx about 5 p.m. The police said they had been tipped off that Mr. Garcia was involved in the attack.

The police said Mr. Garcia and the other 10 suspects were part of a gang — the Latin King Goonies — that attacked four men. The first attack occurred early on Oct. 3, when the men set upon a 17-year-old who was trying to join the gang, brutally beating him because he had been seen with a gay 30-year-old man. The group later attacked another 17-year-old and tortured the 30-year-old man, then sought out his 40-year-old brother and beat him, the police said.

They said Mr. Garcia punched the 30-year-old man twice with a chain wrapped around his fist. He was charged with the same crimes as the other suspects.",nytimes.com,True

The two men were tried under the Fair Housing Act, a federal law that makes it a crime to use someone’s race or national origin to prevent him from living where he chooses.

Mr. Donchak’s lawyer, William Fetterhoff, said that the trial amounted to a case of double jeopardy — being tried twice for the same crime — and that the two were indicted only because the government was dissatisfied with the state verdict.

He said that the encounter was a result of young male aggression soaked with alcohol. “Once a fight among teens begins, then the sky is the limit for name calling, insults and foul language,” Mr. Fetterhoff said Thursday by telephone from Scranton. “It didn’t matter that Mr. Ramírez was white, black, Hispanic or shiny green.”

The case had become a cause célèbre for Hispanic groups.

“The verdict sends an important message that hate crimes are not to be tolerated,” said Clarissa Martinez, director of immigration at the National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights organization. “In this case, justice has been made.”

A lawyer for Mr. Piekarsky, James Swetz, said by telephone that the two men would appeal. He said the Fair Housing Act required not only a finding of racial or ethnic bias, but also that it relate directly to preventing the victim from living where he chooses. It was intended to prevent threatening situations like the placing of burning crosses on black people’s lawns in the past.

“It’s an attempt to put a square peg in a round hole,” Mr. Swetz said. “There is no evidence that these kids knew that Ramírez lived in the borough.”

Prosecutors disagreed, and managed to persuade the jury.

The case raised difficult questions that are rooted in the immigration debate that has swept the country in recent years: for example, whether, as a person in the country illegally, Mr. Ramírez even had a right to the federal government’s protection of his housing, as the Fair Housing Act designates.

The student, Michael Enright, has been in custody since his arrest on charges of repeatedly cutting a cabby with a knife in Midtown on Aug. 24 after the driver said he was Muslim. The driver, Ahmed H. Sharif, 44, required more than two dozen stitches.

Justice Richard D. Carruthers said that Mr. Enright, 21, could be released pending the resolution of his case if he posted bail, surrendered his passport, wore a monitoring device on his ankle and agreed to an 8 p.m. curfew.

Mr. Enright, who appeared in State Supreme Court in Manhattan looking a bit disheveled, was expected to make the bail, though it was unclear when.

His lawyer, Lawrence M. Fisher, wrote in a bail application that Mr. Enright's mother was willing to put up her $300,000 home in Brewster, N.Y., toward bail.

Mr. Enright, who had returned several months before the slashing from filming a documentary about soldiers in Afghanistan, was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism, Mr. Fisher wrote in the application. Mr. Fisher said he planned to seek a psychiatric defense.

Mr. Enright was held at Bellevue Hospital Center for psychiatric treatment after his arrest, but doctors cleared him this month, and he was moved to Rikers Island, the application said.

Mr. Sharif said that the two of them initially made small talk when Mr. Enright got into his taxi. After he told Mr. Enright that he was Muslim, Mr. Sharif said, Mr. Enright later said, ''This is the checkpoint'' and ''I have to bring you down.''

The episode drew outrage from community and elected leaders. But word about what happened in the unoccupied apartment did not reach the police until they showed up days later, with a search warrant, on Oct. 6.

On Thursday and Friday, the police arrested seven of the suspects and said they were hunting for two more. On Saturday, an eighth suspect turned himself in to detectives.

The men grabbed the 17-year-old, officials said, beating and sodomizing him. They went on to beat and torture another 17-year-old and the 30-year-old man before robbing the older man’s apartment and beating his brother, the authorities said.

The assaults took place in an empty apartment inside a brick house at 1910 Osborne Place in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx. Afterward, the attackers meticulously cleaned the apartment, tearing up the carpet, pouring bleach down the drain and painting the walls.

“If you snitch, your family is gonna get it,” he said, according to the complaint.

Then, it said, Mr. Mendez inserted a wooden stick into the victim’s rectum, and asked, “Do you like this?”

The attacks unfolded inside 1910 Osborne Place, a four-story brick building with a lime-green door on a third-floor porch. The building is across the street from an elementary school on a quiet block in Morris Heights, a largely Hispanic neighborhood.

Officials said Saturday that the building’s owner had paid fines on two Buildings Department violations — one for doing work without a permit, another for having too many tenants — since 2005. Both had followed complaints to the city’s 311 line.

A makeshift tribute appeared on the steps Saturday: pink roses with a card calling for “Prayers for healing — for our community.” Gov. David A. Paterson, five members of the City Council, and a coterie of other politicians and ministers marched down a block to show solidarity with the victims.

He was immediately set upon and tied up. Then the assailants ordered the second teenager to attack the 30-year-old, and they joined in the beating. The beating lasted hours, the police said. The attackers forced the man to drink all 10 cans of liquor — each about twice the size of a can of beer, with a higher alcohol content, 10 percent to 12 percent, according to Four Loko’s Web site.

While the man was held captive and attacked, five of the Latin King Goonies went to his house, which he shared with his 40-year-old brother. Using a key taken from the 30-year-old to get inside, they found his brother in bed. They pulled a blanket over his head and hit him, demanding money. When he refused, one placed a cellphone to the brother’s ear, and he heard the voice of his younger brother, who said he had been kidnapped and who pleaded, “Give them the money.”

The brother complied. The men took $1,000 in cash, two debit cards and a 52-inch television.

The brother managed to free himself about three hours later, and he called the police, leaving out the fact that his brother was being held. By then it was Monday morning. Detectives went to the brothers’ home and, upon leaving, saw the 30-year-old, passed out on the landing from the alcohol he had consumed. But having no reason to believe he had been a victim of a crime, they did not question him.

Detectives returned later that day, suspicious of how the robbers had entered the brothers’ home without using force, and the 30-year-old told them he had been picked up in a van by strangers and forced to give them his keys and address, the police said.

Officers still had no idea about the first teen who had visited the hospital, because he had not called the police, and hospitals are not required to inform the authorities about assaults, the police said. The man had said he was robbed near 1910 Osborne, and police officers tried to obtain a search warrant for the house but were told they did not have enough cause, the police said.

Late on Tuesday the second teenager walked into a Bronx police station house and gave a version of what had happened, the police said. None of the three victims, in their first interviews with the police, were fully forthcoming, fearing reprisal and wanting to keep their lives a secret. But the second teenager gave an address, and a second request for a search warrant was granted.

On Wednesday morning, officers entered 1910 Osborne Place and found a surprising sight: an immaculate house, with fresh coats of paint and the smell of bleach hanging thick in the air. One detective called the house “the cleanest crime scene I’ve ever seen,” Mr. Kelly said.

“Lots of bleach and paint were used to cover the blood shed by their tortured prey,” he said. “They even poured bleach down the drains.”

Rugs and linoleum had been ripped out. Detectives were able to scrape evidence, including pubic hair and empty liquor cans, from the house, but not much was found, Mr. Kelly said.

The break in the case came later Wednesday when someone in a crowd of onlookers outside the house quietly slipped an officer his phone number and, when a detective called, gave the name of the man believed to be the ringleader of the group of nine: Ildefonzo Mendez, 23. Officers later learned the name of the first victim from the other teenager.

By Wednesday night, all three victims had given full accounts of the attacks, and for the next 36 hours, officers with the Hate Crimes Task Force, the Gang Division and Special Victims squad worked up a list of nine suspects.

Arrests began Thursday.

The other suspects under arrest were identified as David Rivera, 21; Nelson Falu, 17; Steven Carballo, 17; Denis Peitars, 17; Bryan Almonte, 17; and Brian Cepeda, 16. They were being held by the police in the Bronx on Friday night, with no arraignment scheduled. Still being sought, the police said, are Elmer Confessor, 23, and Ruddy Vargas-Perez, 22.

Coming on the eve of Bullying Prevention Month in October and National Coming Out Day on Monday, the suicide immediately touched a nerve. It has generated a nationwide conversation about the vulnerability of gay teenagers and prompted celebrities like the talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, the former “American Idol” judge Paula Abdul and Tim Gunn, of the television series “Project Runway,” to speak out against harassment. Ms. DeGeneres, who is gay, posted a video on her Web site in which she described Mr. Clementi’s suicide as a “wake-up call” and teenage bullying as an epidemic.

The forum on Thursday, in which Anthony Bevilacqua, a former violinist from the Ridgewood Symphony Orchestra, played a piece he had composed called “Heaven’s New Angel,” was the latest gathering to remember Mr. Clementi, 18, and to urge tougher laws against bullying. On Wednesday, at a town meeting at Rutgers, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg said he would introduce legislation to make colleges adopt a code of conduct that prohibits bullying. The law would also provide money for schools to establish programs to prevent such harassment.

Both town meetings were organized by the gay rights group Garden State Equality.

Mr. Ravi, 18, of Plainsboro, N.J., and Ms. Wei, also 18, of Princeton Junction, were charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for using a “camera to view and transmit a live image” of Mr. Clementi. The most serious charges carry a maximum sentence of five years. Mr. Ravi was additionally charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for trying a similar live transmission on Sept. 21, the day before the suicide.

Prosecutors are now weighing whether to upgrade the charges to a hate crime based on Mr. Clementi’s sexual orientation. The Middlesex County prosecutor, Bruce J. Kaplan, said last week that his office would make “every effort to assess whether bias played a role in the incident.”

Mr. Ravi made reference to his roommate’s sexual orientation in a Twitter message after he successfully caught him on camera, writing: “I saw him making out with a dude. Yay.”

On Tuesday, lawyers for Ms. Wei issued a statement, declaring her innocence and saying that she “committed no crime” and that “her remarkable reputation is being unjustly tarnished by uninformed and incorrect assumptions.” On Wednesday, Mr. Ravi’s lawyer, Steven D. Altman, said in a statement that he was “heartened to hear” that prosecutors were “taking their time to learn all the facts before rushing to judgment.”

Many in the audience on Thursday had driven long distances to show their support for Mr. Clementi and gay rights. “I’m here to make sure this person didn’t kill himself in vain,” said Chase Kruppo, 22, of Jackson, N.J., a recent college graduate and a volunteer for the Stonewall Community Foundation, a gay-rights organization. “We should not be here tonight.”",nytimes.com,True

A report the project prepared on violence against gays nationwide showed they were as susceptible to hate violence now as they were a decade ago, if not more so.

“The reality is, if people are looking to perpetrate antigay bias and violence, there are very few places in this world that are safe once that intent has formed,” Ms. Stapel said.

The victim in the attack at the Stonewall on Sunday was using the restroom when Mr. Francis, at the urinal next to him, asked him what kind of bar it was, Kiran Singh, an assistant district attorney, said in court. The man told Mr. Francis it was a gay bar, Ms. Singh said, to which Mr. Francis responded with a slur.

Mr. Francis demanded $20, Ms. Singh said, before he and Mr. Orlando pushed the man to the ground. Mr. Orlando held the man while Mr. Francis punched him, Ms. Singh said.

Mr. Francis and Mr. Orlando ran from the bar, Ms. Singh said, and some of the patrons chased them until the two men were caught by police officers.

On Sept. 19, Mr. Ravi messaged his Twitter followers that he had gone to Ms. Wei’s dormitory room and activated a webcam in his own room, showing Mr. Clementi as he was “making out with a dude.” Prosecutors said the images were streamed live on the Internet.

Malcolm Lazin, a former federal prosecutor who is executive director of Equality Forum, a national gay rights advocacy group, called on prosecutors to charge the two students with reckless manslaughter. “Clearly, what they did was premeditated,” Mr. Lazin said. “This was not a visceral response.

But several lawyers said it was hard to imagine that prosecutors could make a case for manslaughter, which would require them to show that Mr. Ravi and Ms. Wei foresaw that their actions would lead to a death.

“I think it would be hard to show that their conduct reached a level of recklessness that caused Tyler Clementi to commit suicide,” said Jay V. Surgent, a criminal defense lawyer in Lyndhurst, N.J.

Instead, these lawyers said, it was more likely that prosecutors would pursue bias charges.

Robert A. Mintz, a criminal defense lawyer in Newark and a former federal prosecutor, said, “What prosecutors will be looking at is whether this is a prank that had gone horribly wrong, or whether this was an orchestrated scheme to intimidate the victim based on his sexual orientation.”

Mr. Mintz said that prosecutors would likely review the students’ e-mail and Twitter messages, read any essays or blog entries, and interview friends about what they might have said. “If there’s an accumulation of circumstantial evidence, that can be very powerful,” he said.

If the students are charged and convicted of a hate crime, they could face up to 10 years in prison, instead of 5 years for the privacy charge alone. State Senator Shirley K. Turner has proposed legislation to raise the top sentence for invasion of privacy to 10 years.

In March 2009 in Kosice, in eastern Slovakia, police detained six Roma boys who were suspected of having robbed an elderly lady. The police forced the boys to undress, slap and kiss each other, while taking videos of them on their mobile phones. After a video of the incident was released by SME, a leading Slovak daily, nine policemen were fired. The boys later admitted they had stolen a purse.

While the police and government authorities have been at pains not to attribute any racial motive to the Monday killing, Slovak analysts said the incident had nevertheless tapped into the country’s neuroses about its Roma minority.

“To me, the reaction of the society has been worse than the killings themselves,” said Stanislav Daniel, a Slovak of Roma origin who is a researcher at the European Roma Rights Center in Budapest. “Rather than focusing on the killer, the message has been: the shooting was bad but these Roma people he killed were bad, too.”

Police said the killer, 48-year-old Lubomir Harman, who shot himself after being cornered by the police, lived in the same building as his Roma victims. Single and living alone, he had been jobless since August 2008, and had legally acquired six weapons.

He was a member of a club of reservist soldiers and had completed two years basic military service between 1981 and 1983, but he was not a professional soldier. Neighbors and police said Mr. Harman, who used a machine gun and two pistols to attack his victims, may have been angered by the loud noise emulating from the victims’ apartment in the working class neighborhood of Devinska Nova Ves.

Police Chief Jaroslav Spisiak said this week the Roma family that was killed led a “rich social life” in which they hosted a steady stream of visitors.

Other neighbors were less charitable, accusing the family of everything from disturbing the peace to dealing drugs, and noted that the victims and the killer had a history of disagreements.

But in a video interview posted on a Slovak news website, Aktualne, one neighbor named Silvie, who declined to give her last name, said that the Roma family were “poor, but decent” and that Mr. Harman, laconic and unpleasant, had clearly lost control.

“Every month I would lend them some money or give them some old bread,” she said. “Within a few days, as soon as they received their pension, I got my money back.”

Lukas Fila, the deputy editor of SME, a leading Slovak newspaper, lamented that some Slovaks were using the killings to vent their frustrations with their Roma neighbors, and inadvertently siding with the killer. “No one approves of what happened,” he said. “But people who don’t like the Roma are saying, ‘I can understand how he did this.”’

On a discussion forum on www.cas.sk, a Slovak news site, some contributors this week said that the killer had been provoked, while others blamed the state for ignoring what they said was Roma crime. Some challenged the government’s decision to make Thursday a national day of mourning, saying it wasn’t justified since the victims were predominantly Roma.

“Try to live next to a Roma family for a month and you will see for yourselves,” said a contributor who called himself Keenu. “Luckily, not everyone owns a machine gun.”

The killings have also prompted a national discussion about gun control. The Slovak minister of the interior, Daniel Lipsic, said this week he planned to introduce legislation that would ban the use of machine guns for sporting purposes.

At about 11 p.m. on Monday, the teenagers in Carlton were at “some type of gathering,” Mr. Cardone said, when one of them suggested going to harass people at the “cult house” — what they called the mosque.

The teenagers got in a Chevrolet Blazer and drove in front of the mosque, beeping the horn and yelling, said Scott D. Hess, the county sheriff. Mr. Cardone could not immediately say if the teenagers yelled anti-Muslim statements, and he said it had not yet been determined whether their actions would be classified as a hate crime.

At one point, a worshiper, David Bell, went outside the mosque to see if he could spot the vehicle. “It came at him and brushed up against him,” said Mr. Cardone, who added that Mr. Bell had been treated for cuts and contusions at a hospital and released.

Mr. Enright was arrested Tuesday evening and charged with attempted second-degree murder as a hate crime, first-degree assault as a hate crime and criminal possession of a weapon. He was being held in Bellevue Hospital Center’s prison ward on Thursday.

Sharman Stein, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Correction said Mr. Enright was admitted to the psychiatric ward on Thursday night. She could not comment on why he was moved, but said that ""the mental health staff in the jail, at Rikers, thought he should be seen by the Bellevue"" health professionals. Mr. Enright was sent to Bellevue, and the ""staff there made a clinical decision to admit him to the psychiatric ward.""

The police said Mr. Enright had been drinking for much of Tuesday afternoon before getting in the cab and exchanging pleasantries with the driver, Ahmed H. Sharif, 44, who is originally from Bangladesh. He asked Mr. Sharif if he was Muslim and greeted him with “salaam aleikum,” an Arabic greeting that means “peace be upon you.” He even asked Mr. Sharif how his celebration of Ramadan was going before he began cursing at him and slashing him in his face, arm and hands with a knife, Mr. Sharif told the police.

“He wasn’t, as I understand it, directly involved in any combat,” Mr. Chase said. “But he was close enough, and as we all know about these two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, conflict zones are very fluid, and he had expressed a real kind of intense empathy” for those serving there.

As the cab inched up Third Avenue and reached 39th Street, Mr. Sharif said in a phone interview, Mr. Enright suddenly began cursing at him and shouting “This is the checkpoint” and “I have to bring you down.” He said he told him he had to bring the king of Saudi Arabia to the checkpoint.

“He was talking like he was a soldier,” Mr. Sharif said.

He withdrew a Leatherman knife, Mr. Sharif said, and, reaching through the opening in the plastic divider, slashed Mr. Sharif’s throat. When Mr. Sharif turned, he said, Mr. Enright stabbed him in his face, on his arm and on his thumbs.

Mr. Sharif said he told him: “I beg of you, don’t kill me. I worked so hard, I have a family.”

He said Mr. Enright bolted out of the slowly moving cab. Mr. Sharif then found a police officer who apprehended Mr. Enright. The officer told him, Mr. Sharif said, that Mr. Enright said he had tried to rob him.

Mr. Sharif received more than two dozen stitches at Bellevue Hospital Center and was released. Mr. Enright was given a psychiatric evaluation there.

The Manhattan district attorney charged Mr. Enright with second-degree attempted murder as a hate crime, first-degree assault as a hate crime and criminal possession of a weapon. He was arraigned on Wednesday in Manhattan Criminal Court, appearing in cargo shorts and a polo shirt, and ordered held without bail. If convicted of the top charge, he would face up to 25 years in prison.

The violence that erupted during the cab ride came amid a heated and persisting national debate over whether to situate a Muslim community center and mosque two blocks north of ground zero. Upon learning of the attack on the cabdriver, some Muslim groups called for political and religious leaders to quiet tensions.

Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement: “As other American minorities have experienced, hate speech often leads to hate crimes. Sadly, we’ve seen how the deliberate public vilification of Islam can lead some individuals to violence against innocent people.”

In a statement, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said, “This attack runs counter to everything that New Yorkers believe, no matter what God we may pray to.” He said he had spoken to Mr. Sharif and told him “ethnic or religious bias has no place in our city.” He invited him to come to see him at City Hall on Thursday.

The arresting officers said Mr. Enright seemed to be drunk, the police said, and a city official briefed on the investigation said there was an empty bottle of Scotch in his backpack. The police did not do a Breathalyzer test.

Mr. Sharif, however, said Mr. Enright did not appear inebriated to him.

Mr. Sharif, who lives in Jamaica, Queens, with his wife and four children, came to the United States about 25 years ago and was a cook before becoming a cabdriver 15 years ago. He said nothing of this nature had happened to him before. Recently, some passengers asked him about the center planned near ground zero, he recalled, and he replied that he was against it, that there was no need to put it there.

What is known about Mr. Enright presents a complicated picture. An only child, he lives with his mother in Brewster, N.Y., a middle-class suburb about 50 miles north of Manhattan. Neighbors said he was friendly enough and often skateboarded outside his house.

He is a senior, studying film, at School of Visual Arts, on East 23rd Street, near where he hailed the cab.

He was arrested in November on charges of criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. According to the police, he was picked up on Second Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, where he was acting violently, banging on walls and ringing doorbells. There was also a warrant out for him at the time for another violation, though it was unclear on Wednesday what it was for.

An article in The Journal News in March said the film, “Home of the Brave,” was to be Mr. Enright’s senior thesis. The article said that in October, Mr. Enright spent time at Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii filming the Marines as they prepared for deployment to Afghanistan. In April and May, he spent five weeks embedded with them in Afghanistan, according to military officials in Afghanistan. One of the members of the regiment was a friend from Brewster High School, Cpl. Alex Eckner.

In the article, Mr. Enright said that the experiences of Mr. Eckner led him to want to do the film.

Mr. Enright is also a volunteer with Intersections International, an initiative of the Collegiate Churches of New York that promotes justice and faith across religions and cultures. The organization, which covered part of Mr. Enright’s travel expenses to Afghanistan, has been a staunch supporter of the Islamic center near ground zero. Mr. Enright volunteered with the group’s veteran-civilian dialogue project.

Holder Jr., has promoted his department’s handling of these cases, pointing out that 56 of 109 have been closed, with many more on the brink. The department has taken the unusual step of writing letters to the families of victims, detailing the findings and explaining why the case cannot be pursued further — in many cases because the suspect is dead.

But critics say the numbers are misleading because instead of aggressively investigating the dozen or so cases that might still yield a viable prosecution, the department has taken the easier route of closing the ones that were long shots to begin with.

“If this whole effort goes through and there’s no evidence of an aggressive manhunt and it results in no prosecutions, then there will not be a credible acceptance of the results by the American people,” said Alvin Sykes, the president of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign in Chicago and an instrumental force in the passage of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act in 2008.

“Everybody put me on the back burner for years and years,” said Mr. Allen’s son, Henry C. Allen, 65. He had hoped the cold case initiative would change things, but said the response has been slow. He said the legwork had been done. “Here’s the people you can contact, here’s their phone number, here’s their address,” he said. “I don’t have the authority to go knock on their door, but you do — and it still don’t get done.”

Special Agent Cynthia Deitle, chief of the F.B.I.’s civil rights division, said that agents were not permitted to share the progress of continuing investigations with families or the public. Witnesses, she said, might not always be forthcoming about having cooperated with the F.B.I. The Allen case remains open.

The Till bill authorized up to $13.5 million a year to solve racially motivated murders before 1970, but in fiscal year 2009 no money was allocated. In fiscal year 2010, the Justice Department received $1.6 million for civil rights cold cases. The F.B.I. received an $8 million increase for its civil rights division, which handles human trafficking, hate crimes, present-day civil rights violations and cold cases, a spokesman said.

Officials have repeatedly insisted that lack of money was not an obstacle. “There’s never been a resource issue whether it was people or money on our end,” Agent Deitle said.

More than 20 civil rights cases have been successfully prosecuted since 1994, including the 2005 conviction of Edgar Ray Killen, 85, one of the Klansmen responsible for the 1964 deaths of three civil rights workers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.

Those prosecutions were driven by the persistence of surviving family members and the painstaking work of journalists and documentary filmmakers.

The cold case initiative was supposed to put the Justice Department in the lead. But reporters like Jerry Mitchell of The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., one of the foremost experts on civil rights-era cases, say investigators are still lagging behind, and sometimes are even failing to follow up on leads that journalists, usually working from leaked copies of the F.B.I.’s own aging files, turn up.

After Mr. Killen was convicted, Mr. Mitchell continued to investigate. In 2007, after combing through thousands of pages of leaked F.B.I. files, he published interviews with two women who, hours before the killings, were in the car of a deputy sheriff for an unrelated reason. The women heard the deputy discuss the three civil rights workers with Billy Wayne Posey, a Klansman.

But the F.B.I. showed no sign that it, too, was pursuing an investigation until the summer of 2009, Mr. Mitchell said. It was only last fall, after Mr. Posey died, that the F.B.I. contacted the two women, one of them, Linda Johnson, said in a telephone interview.

Stanley Nelson, the editor of The Concordia Sentinel, a weekly in Ferriday, La., has been producing articles on a cluster of killings in that area that were connected to the Silver Dollar Group, a Klan organization that terrorized the area with impunity in the 1960s. He has worked with the Syracuse University College of Law’s Cold Case Justice Initiative, where students have gone through thousands of F.B.I. documents, even finding files on a missing black hotel porter, Joseph Edwards, that a federal prosecutor had said the bureau did not have.

In another case, that of Frank Morris, a black cobbler who died from burns after his shop was set on fire, it was Mr. Nelson who found and interviewed a witness, a black teenager who worked at the store. At the time, his mother forbade him to speak to law enforcement officers.

Dolan told parishioners during Mass on Sunday that he was saddened by a spate of suspected anti-Hispanic attacks on Staten Island that had left some Latin American immigrants fearing for their safety.

Archbishop Dolan made the remarks during a Spanish-language sermon at St. Mary’s of The Assumption Roman Catholic Church in the borough’s Port Richmond section.

The small neighborhood is home to the majority of the borough’s Mexican immigrants, who have been the targets of most of the dozen attacks since April, the authorities have said. A gay Hispanic couple also was attacked.

In the most recent attack, a 15-year-old Mexican was robbed of his MP3 player at knifepoint on Aug. 18, the Staten Island prosecutor’s office said.

The police classified the attack as a bias crime, but a suspect arrested in the case is not facing hate-crime charges.

The suspect, Yashua Plair, 17, pleaded not guilty to charges including robbery and menacing on Sunday afternoon.

The attacks have underscored long-simmering tensions between Hispanic immigrants and blacks.

The defendant, Keith Phoenix, was convicted in May of attacking Jose O. Sucuzhanay on a street corner in Bushwick, Brooklyn, after Mr. Phoenix and another man, Hakim Scott, 27, jumped out of their sport utility vehicle, yelling slurs at Mr. Sucuzhanay and his brother, Romel Sucuzhanay.

Prosecutors said that the two assailants pounced on the Sucuzhanays because they were Hispanic and because Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Scott suspected they were gay.

Justice Patricia M. DiMango of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn sentenced Mr. Phoenix, who was convicted in June of murder and assault as hate crimes, to 37 years to life in prison. She sentenced Mr. Scott, who was convicted of manslaughter and assault but cleared of more serious hate-crime charges, to 37 years.

Both defendants had pleaded for leniency, Mr. Phoenix in a statement read by his lawyer, Mr. Scott in one he read himself. Mr. Scott urged the judge to treat them separately and not let Mr. Phoenix's case affect his sentence.

''I feel a certain amount of comfort that there is a law and there will be justice, the Sucuzhanays' mother, Julia Quintuna, said through an interpreter before the hearing in Justice DiMango's courtroom. After the sentencing, Ms. Quintuna said, ''This is a very sad day. It's sad for my family and for the family of the defendants. I feel very sorry for the defendants, and of course there is a huge emptiness in my heart because of my son.''

Mr. Phoenix, who was arrested nearly three months after the crime as he hid in the bathroom of an apartment in Yonkers, was tried twice. His first trial, in May, ended with the jury deadlocked. When he was arrested, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said that he showed no remorse.

The Sucuzhanays were walking home from a church party and a stop at a bar, arm in arm. Jose Sucuzhanay's girlfriend was with them.

Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Scott, along with a third man, Demetrius Nathaniel, were driving home from another party and had stopped at a traffic light where the Sucuzhanays were crossing the street. Mr. Phoenix yelled an antigay slur from behind the wheel. Testimony at Mr. Phoenix's first trial indicated that the Sucuzhanays responded by kicking Mr. Phoenix's sport utility vehicle.

Mr. Scott bolted out, slammed a beer bottle against Jose Sucuzhanay's head and knocked him down, according to testimony. Wielding the broken bottle, Mr. Scott ran after Romel Sucuzhanay while Mr. Phoenix jumped out and grabbed an aluminum bat from the back of the S.U.V. and beat Jose Sucuzhanay.

Mr. Phoenix said in his videotaped confession in 2008 that he had reached for the bat because he believed that Jose Sucuzhanay was pulling out a handgun.

Romel Sucuzhanay, who suffered relatively minor injuries from the bottle, testified in April that he had moved back to Ecuador because of ''what happened to my brother.'' As he left the courtroom on Thursday, he said he would not comment on the sentences, saying the hearing had brought back the too many memories.

''My future future is in pieces,'' he said. ''I have mental problems. And it is all because of the ignorance of these people and this distant event.''

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The assault occurred about 2:30 a.m. on Saturday as the victim, a 17-year-old high school junior, whose name was not disclosed by the authorities, was returning home after working a late shift as a busboy at a restaurant in Manhattan, the police and neighborhood advocates said.

As he passed through the intersection of Castleton Avenue and Simonson Place — three blocks from the heart of the police buildup on Port Richmond Avenue, the neighborhood’s main commercial strip — a Hispanic man approached him and asked him a question, possibly to distract him, according to the police. Suddenly, two black men appeared and began punching the victim in the face and yelling anti-Mexican slurs, the police said. The three men stole $10 from the teenager and fled.

The victim was treated for lacerations at Richmond University Medical Center and released.

The police said Saturday’s attack was at least the 10th instance in the past four months in which assailants, mostly young black men, have assaulted Mexican immigrants walking in Port Richmond, which has seen the number of Mexican residents climb sharply over the past two decades.",nytimes.com,True

“The swastika has morphed into a universal symbol of hate,” said Abraham Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy organization. “Today it’s used as an epithet against African-Americans, Hispanics and gays, as well as Jews, because it is a symbol which frightens.”

Observing the trend, he said that his group had decided it would examine reports of scrawled swastikas for contextual clues. If it appears Jews were not the target, the incident will not be included in the league’s annual audit of anti-Semitic hate crimes.

“A year ago, there was a swastika put on Plymouth Rock,” Mr. Foxman said in an interview. “We saw it as a symbol of hatred against America, maybe against immigrants, I don’t know. But to count that swastika as an anti-Semitic incident would not be accurate.”",nytimes.com,True

Here in Newberry, a town better known for its college and its opera house in what was once the egg-and-dairy capital of South Carolina, the sight of beret-topped men with walkie-talkies and “black power” placards attracted curious spectators.

“It’s really interesting that there’s a hate group taking a position on calling something a hate crime,” said Rebecca Smith, a white retired auctioneer who sat with her husband on the sidewalk in front of their house, watching the march go by. “They kind of cancel each other out.”

The march and demonstration attracted several hundred of Newberry’s black residents, who pumped their fists in the air and agreed to support the group’s seven demands, including justice for Mr. Hill, reparations for slavery and “self-improvement in the black community.”

But several people, asked why they had come, did not bring up the killing. Instead, they talked about the need for better housing and programs for youth, the problem of gang violence and what they said was racial profiling by the police.

Sheriff Lee Foster, one of a seemingly endless supply of law enforcement officers from a jumble of local and state agencies who were mustered to keep the Newberry peace, looked on unimpressed. “This is not about Anthony Hill,” he said. “This is something that they have hitched their wagon to, to allow them to advance their agenda.”

Indeed, the Hill case does not cry out as an example of racism or incompetence on the part of law enforcement officials. The man charged with his slaying, Gregory Collins, was smoked out of his mobile home with tear gas and arrested within hours of the body’s discovery. A broken piece of rope was still tied to his truck, the police said.

South Carolina has no hate crime statute, so the Federal Bureau of Investigation was called in. Federal authorities must determine whether Mr. Collins will face an additional charge under the federal Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Actof 2009, named in part after a black man who in 1998 in Jasper, Tex., was dragged to death behind a pickup truck. A contingent of the New Black Panthers, armed with assault rifles and shotguns, protested in Jasper at the time.

If convicted of murder, Mr. Collins faces 30 years to life in prison. The prosecutor, Jerry Peace, said he did not yet know if the crime included the aggravating factors that would qualify it for the death penalty. Charles Grose, Mr. Collin’s appointed lawyer, declined to comment.

It is not clear if the Newberry killing was, in fact, racially motivated. Mr. Hill, 30, and Mr. Collins, 19, worked and lunched together at a local poultry plant and appeared to be friends. The day before the killing, Mr. Collins picked Mr. Hill up at home and they went to a shooting range, Sheriff Foster said. They rented movies at Wal-Mart and repaired to Mr. Collins’s house, the police said.

Rumors have swirled that the killing was actually a crime of passion involving a woman, but the police say they are still looking for a motive.

Rumors have also swirled, thanks largely to the Panthers’ leader, Malik Zulu Shabazz, a lawyer from Washington, that Mr. Collins had Confederate battle flags and white supremacist paraphernalia and tattoos.

“It’s obvious he’s got information we don’t have,” Sheriff Foster said of Mr. Shabazz. “We need to subpoena him to come before the grand jury to give evidence.” The police did find more than 20 guns in Mr. Collins’s home.

The national attention on the New Panthers has centered on a 2008 video showing two members, one with a baton, at a polling station in Philadelphia. The Justice Department dropped a voter intimidation case against them last year after obtaining an injunction against one of the men, King Samir Shabazz, saying the evidence did not support prosecution.

In recent days, commentators like Rush Limbaugh have delighted in showing a video of King Samir Shabazz, who the group says was suspended for a year, saying, “I hate white people. All of them. Every last iota,” and suggesting the killing of white babies.

A jury in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn delivered the verdict around 9 p.m., after seven hours of deliberations. The decision came at the end of a two-week retrial of Keith Phoenix on charges stemming from the 2008 murder of José Sucuzhañay.

Mr. Phoenix faces life in prison. In his first trial, which ended in May, the jury was deadlocked because of a holdout juror.

Prosecutors said that Mr. Phoenix and an accomplice, Hakim Scott, attacked Mr. Sucuzhañay (pronounced suh-KOO-shen-y’eye) and his brother in December 2008 because they were Hispanic and because the suspects believed the brothers were gay.

“Criminals that prey on the elderly, they love the elderly — this is their source of wealth,” said Kristen A. Kane, a Queens assistant district attorney.

Led by Ms. Kane, who runs a specialized elder fraud unit, the efforts have made the Queens district attorney, Richard A.

Some people concerned about the prevalence of more classically understood bigotry say that new uses of the hate crime law could ultimately dilute its power. The main purpose of the law, said Steven Freeman, legal affairs director at the Anti-Defamation League, is to stiffen penalties for crimes that inflict additional fear on marginalized groups like ethnic or religious minorities or gays.

New York’s law is ambiguous. It says prosecutors must prove only a crime was committed “because of a belief or perception regarding the race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation of a person.”

But the language that opens the legislation clearly focuses on hate: “Crimes motivated by invidious hatred toward particular groups not only harm individual victims but send a powerful message of intolerance and discrimination to all members of the group to which the victim belongs.”

That was the nickname of Nancy Jace, who bilked five elderly men out of $250,000, pretending to romance them and persuading them to pay for fictitious family emergencies. Ms. Kane was frustrated when Ms. Jace, 37, pleaded guilty in 2004 and served just six months in jail.

When a similar defendant came along, Ms. Kane had an idea. Shirley Miller, 43, who hoodwinked four elderly men out of $500,000, became the first New Yorker charged with grand larceny as a hate crime against the elderly. She pleaded guilty and served four months, but would have faced one to three years if she had not paid $175,000 in restitution. In 2006, Sherry Kaslov, 30, pleaded guilty to similar charges; she served four months and was hit with 10 years of probation.

Those sentences may not sound huge, Ms. Kane said, but the hate charge gave her extra leverage in plea bargaining. By winning felony pleas and probation, prosecutors ensured that repeat offenders would receive strong sentences.

The cases kept coming. In 2006, Natasha Marks, 20, was convicted of swindling more than $1 million from an 86-year-old man as a hate crime, including taking out a $550,000 mortgage on his house; a fugitive, she faces two to six years. Wando Delmaro was sentenced to 10 years after pleading guilty to a hate crime: posing as a water-company employee and distracting elderly people while accomplices burglarized them.

The next year in Brooklyn, a high-profile case bolstered Ms. Kane. Michael Sandy, a gay man, died after robbers chased him into traffic. One defendant testified that he was gay. The judge ruled that he could still be charged with a hate crime since prosecutors said he went after Mr. Sandy believing gay men were easier to rob. Jurors convicted him but later complained that they did not think the hate crime applied.

Then there was Alexandra Gilmore, 37, who took $800,000 from Artee McKoy, 93, a retired barber and old friend of her late father who had Alzheimer’s disease. She stole his house and tricked him into refinancing another. She pleaded guilty last year and is serving two to six years.

Maria Thompson, Mr. McKoy’s daughter, wanted Ms. Gilmore to get even more time. Her father died in 2008, and she is still struggling in court to get control of his estate. In the meantime, the house where she grew up is foreclosed and padlocked. She cannot enter to sort her father’s possessions or find a photograph to remember him by. She has no idea if she and her four siblings will ultimately inherit any equity in the home, which had been fully paid off before the scheme.

Mr. McKoy’s own kindness inspired the scheme, said Ms. Thompson, 69, who works as a greeter at Wal-Mart. When Ms. Gilmore’s father died, he lent her money to avoid foreclosure of her own house, revealing that he had savings, “and then she ripped him off,” Ms. Thompson said.

Ms. Kane got another crack at Ms. Jace. She is now serving 8 to 24 years for defrauding a series of landlords, a sentence stiffened by her plea to the earlier hate crime. Ms. Kane did not charge one this time.

It opens with a reminder of the awful 1990s wars in the former Yugoslovia. It succinctly details the respective ethnic hatreds via comments from three Chicago immigrants: Serbian Nikola Dokic, Croatian Robert Palos and Bosnian Adis Sirbubalo. Mr. Momcilovic is a Croatian-born Serb.

https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E2D6123BF934A15756C0A9669D8B63&rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"RIVERHEAD, N.Y. -- The white Long Island teenager convicted of killing a Hispanic immigrant in a 2008 hate crime attack in Patchogue was sentenced on Wednesday to 25 years in prison in a hearing that ended with the teenager's father leaving the courtroom in a tearful rage.

The teenager, Jeffrey Conroy, now 19, stood next to his lawyer in State Supreme Court here as Justice Robert W. Doyle told a courtroom filled with relatives, friends and supporters of both Mr. Conroy and the immigrant, Marcelo Lucero, that the proof of Mr. Conroy's guilt was ''overwhelming'' and that he was convicted of ''senseless and brutal crimes.''

The 25-year sentence was the longest possible for first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime, the most serious charge Mr. Conroy faced. Moments after the judge spoke, Mr. Conroy's father, Robert Conroy, 49, a quiet presence in the courtroom during the nearly seven-week trial, stood up and, cursing, shouted that his son was only 17 at the time.

''This is mercy, for crying out loud?'' he yelled from the back of the courtroom as he made his way outside surrounded by court officers, who restrained him briefly after he punched the doors or a wall.

Mr. Conroy was found guilty on April 19 of attacking Mr. Lucero in a train station parking lot in November 2008, one of a series of assaults that prosecutors said Mr. Conroy and six friends carried out as part of an activity that the young men described as ''beaner-hopping'' or ''Mexican-hopping.''

Shortly before the sentencing was announced, Jeffrey Conroy seemed to apologize as he faced the judge. ''I'm really sorry for what happened to Mr. Lucero,'' he said, adding that every day he wished it never happened.

The defense lawyer, William Keahon, read aloud several of the nearly 100 letters that had been sent to the court from Mr. Conroy's supporters -- coaches, neighbors, and adult and teenage friends who asked for leniency. The letters described Mr. Conroy not as hate filled, but as someone who served as a volunteer mentor and coach to football and lacrosse players.

The letters also noted how Mr. Conroy had numerous Hispanic friends, including the woman he has said he plans to marry, Pamela Suarez, who is Bolivian.

But those sentiments were countered by the emotional words of the victim's brother and sister.

Mr. Lucero's younger brother, Joselo Lucero, 35, said that his brother became his role model and father figure after their father died when Joselo was 6. His brother's death left him distraught, with nightmares and even thoughts of suicide, he said.

''When I found out my brother got killed, my entire life collapsed, and I don't know what to say,'' Joselo Lucero said, adding, ''He's a godfather to my nephew. He's 4 years old. He never got to meet my brother, his uncle, his godfather.''

He spoke of justice for ''the invisibles,'' whom he described as the legal and illegal immigrants who come to the United States seeking a better life. ''I don't want this hate to continue,'' he said.

Speaking through a translator, Mr. Lucero's sister, Isabel Lucero, said that she would have wanted Mr. Conroy to be present the day she and her mother learned her brother had been killed, and that she did not forgive Mr. Conroy.

Mr. Lucero, 37, a worker at a dry cleaning shop who had come from Gualaceo, Ecuador, was walking with a friend to another friend's house on the night of the attack. They were surrounded by the seven young men, all students at Patchogue-Medford High School at the time, the authorities said.

After deliberating for four days, a jury found Mr. Conroy guilty of first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime and other charges, in connection with Mr. Lucero's death. He was also found guilty of attempted assaults on three other Hispanic men. On the manslaughter charge, Mr. Conroy faced a minimum of 8 years and a maximum of 25 years.

Mr. Conroy received the maximum sentence on all the charges against him, but because the sentences are to run concurrently, and because he has already served nearly two years and will receive credit for good behavior, he could actually serve 18 years, his lawyer said.

Mr. Conroy is appealing the conviction. He testified that he lied to the police when he told them he stabbed Mr. Lucero because he wanted to protect another teenager, whom he said had confessed to him to stabbing Mr. Lucero.

Bloodstains on the knife that the police found on Mr. Conroy, as well as on the gray tank-top and the jeans he wore, matched Mr. Lucero's DNA.

Before the sentencing, the idea of healing and forgiveness seemed a kind of backdrop to the proceedings. Mr. Lucero's mother, Maria Rosario Lucero, had spoken in the past of asking God to forgive Mr. Conroy.

In recent days, Mr. Conroy's father had reached out to the Rev. Dwight Lee Wolter, the pastor of the church where Mr. Lucero's funeral was held, the Congregational Church of Patchogue, and asked him to arrange a private meeting between the Conroy and Lucero families. Although that meeting had not happened, Mr. Wolter was optimistic that it would.

Following the sentencing and Robert Conroy's outburst, the pastor said he was frustrated that the process of reconciliation had taken several steps back.

''It's more polarized now than it was the day of the funeral,'' said the Rev. Wolter, the author of three books on forgiveness. ''I feel sick to my stomach because of the rage, the pain, the lack of any kind of closure.''

He could face life in prison if convicted of the most serious counts.

Some of the counts are hate crime charges, as prosecutors contend that Mr. Phoenix singled out Mr. Sucuzhañay for being Latino and because he thought he was gay. Mr. Sucuzhañay was walking arm and arm with his brother Romel at the time.

Last Thursday, Hakim Scott, who, according to prosecutors, was Mr. Phoenix’s accomplice in the beating, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter but acquitted of more serious hate crime charges. He faces up to 40 years in prison.

Although the holdout juror in Mr. Phoenix’s case was not identified, Mr. Phoenix’s lawyer, Philip J. Smallman, told reporters afterward that jurors were torn over whether to find Mr. Phoenix guilty of murder or the lesser charge of manslaughter.

“I’m a little surprised” about the outcome, said Mr. Smallman, who said he had spoken with the jurors. He also characterized the jury’s 23 requests over a four-day period to review testimony and the specifics of charges against his client as an unusually high number.

One of the prosecutors in the case, Assistant District Attorney Josh Hanshaft, declined to comment on the mistrial.

For his part, Romel Sucuzhañy expressed disappointment with the outcome of the trial but said he was optimistic about the next one.

“My family, we feel very worried. The evidence was there,” he said through a translator to reporters outside the courthouse. “I hope that we have success in the new one.”

In the predawn darkness of Dec. 7, 2008, Romel and José Sucuzhanay, and José’s girlfriend, were walking in a crosswalk in Bushwick, Brooklyn, after attending a church party.

At the same time, Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Scott, and a cousin, Demetrius Nathaniel, were on their way home to the Bronx in a red sport utility vehicle from their own party in Brooklyn, and waiting for a traffic light at the same corner.

Mr. Phoenix, who was driving, yelled an antigay slur at the Sucuzhanays, which caused them to kick the car, according to testimony from Mr. Nathaniel.

Jumping out of the car, Mr. Scott then smashed José over the head with a beer bottle, knocking him to the ground, according to testimony; then he began to chase Romel off with the broken bottle.

Mr. Phoenix then exited the car, grabbing an aluminum bat from the trunk, which he used to beat Jose about a half-dozen times. In his videotaped confession from February 2008, which the jury reviewed twice during deliberations, in addition to its airing during the trial, Mr. Phoenix explained that he grabbed the bat because he thought Jose was reaching for a gun.

“It happened so fast, it happened so fast,” Mr. Phoenix said in the video. He did not take the stand during the trial, but on Tuesday, wearing a blue shirt and dark tie, he watched while the video of his confession played on screens.

For their part, defense lawyers argued that what occurred that night was a drunken street fight not motivated by bias.

In their multiple requests to review testimony and have Justice DiMango clarify what exactly constituted a hate crime, the jury seemed to struggle with whether Mr. Phoenix was really out to hurt Mr. Sucuzhañay because he was Latino or gay.

Still unresolved is the fate of Mr. Phoenix, 30, who hit Mr. Sucuzhañay repeatedly with a baseball bat while he was on the ground, according to testimony. He faces 10 counts of murder, assault and deadly weapon possession, including second-degree murder as a hate crime.

On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Phoenix’s case was handed to a different jury, which deliberated for a few hours and adjourned until Friday. The cases require different juries because Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Scott implicated each other in the beatings.

Mr. Scott, who sat expressionless in a dark suit while the verdict was read, was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. His lawyer, Craig Newman, said he would appeal, because, he said, hitting someone with a bottle should not rise to the level of a manslaughter conviction.

The case touched off demonstrations in 2008 over the perception that the killing happened because the victims were Latino, and the conviction goes only part of the way toward assuring immigrants that they are not targets for violence, advocates said.

“It had been a green light against us,” said Mr. Sinche, the director of the advocacy group Alianza Ecuatoriana Internacional, outside of court. “Today, we got a yellow light, and hopefully tomorrow we will get red light, so this will stop,” he added, referring to the Mr. Phoenix’s case.

A lawyer for Mr. Phoenix said that his client was not looking for minorities or gays when he came across José, his brother Romel, now 36, and another brother, Diego, now 29. “At the end of the day, this is a fight that took place in the length of a New York City traffic light,” said the lawyer, Philip J. Smallman, in his closing arguments. “This, ladies and gentlemen, is not hatred.”

Prosecutors said in their closing remarks that simple prejudice triggered the confrontation.

Describing Mr. Phoenix’s mind-set, Josh Hanshaft, an assistant Kings County district attorney, said that it was “I am better than these two gay Latino men walking down the street.”

Mr. Hanshaft added that Mr. Phoenix showed no remorse, joking with a toll collector on the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge minutes after the attack.

Motive has implications for any sentence in the trial — a finding that a hate crime has been committed increases the minimum sentence — and for the complexion of the entire case: José Sucuzhañay’s beating in 2008 filled the streets with marchers and politicians outraged at the report of a killing brought on by bias.

The case is being heard by two separate juries because Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Scott have implicated each other in the beatings. On Wednesday, one of the juries heard closing arguments in Mr. Scott’s case. Mr. Scott’s lawyer, Craig Newman, referred to the outcry that followed José Sucuzhañay’s killing and statements of condemnation from the Brooklyn district attorney and the mayor.

“That’s not evidence,” Mr. Newman said. “That’s their opinion.”

Mr. Scott sat quietly, his head down, a single black pen in front of him but no paper. He did not testify during the trial, but jurors saw a videotaped statement he gave to the police after his arrest in February 2009. In that statement, he said that as he, Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Phoenix’s cousin sat in a car, José Sucuzhañay spit on him. In the “tussle” that followed, Mr. Scott said, he hit José Sucuzhañay with the bottle.

Mr. Newman said: “Everyone here is saying hate crime, hate crime, hate crime, but they follow up with, it could have been against gays, it could have been against Hispanics. Which one is it?”

In his final appeal to jurors, Mr. Newman took pains to separate his client’s actions from those of Mr. Phoenix, who admitted in his own videotaped testimony that he struck José Sucuzhañay six times with an aluminum bat.

Mr. Phoenix said he was afraid Mr. Sucuzhañay was reaching for a weapon. Jurors heard graphic testimony about the beating: about the sound the bat made as it struck Mr. Sucuzhañay time and again, and how Mr. Phoenix returned to deliver brutal blows to the head as Mr. Sucuzhañay tried to recover. The jurors in Mr. Phoenix’s case will hear closing arguments on Thursday.

On Wednesday, a prosecutor, Patricia McNeill, said Mr. Scott’s actions allowed that beating to occur. By smashing a bottle over his head, Mr. Scott delivered the strike that put Mr. Sucuzhañay on the ground, she said. Then, Mr. Scott chased Romel Sucuzhañay off, so he could not help his brother, she said.

The recent spate of highly publicized attacks on elderly Asians by black teenagers has abruptly enhanced a longstanding perception among Asians that they are disproportionately targets of racially motivated violence.

George Gascón, the San Francisco police chief, announced last week the emergency deployment of 32 additional beat officers to the Bayview-Visitación Valley neighborhood. Although “crime numbers have not gone up,” Chief Gascón said in an interview, he wanted to address the “tremendous amount of fear and apprehension” among Asians.

It is these historically black neighborhoods in southeast San Francisco that have undergone the sharpest demographic changes in the city in the past 20 years. Decades after Koreans transformed the Fillmore district from what it once was — the “Harlem of the West,” its blocks lined by the swaggering, smoky haunts of jazz lore — Chinese started moving to the Bayview in large numbers.

Community leaders predict that the 2010 census will show the Asian population, almost all Chinese, now making up 40 percent of the Bayview’s residents and as many as 60 percent of Visitación Valley’s.

“At one point, one group may emerge because they’ve got greater population and another group feels pushed out — feels like they don’t have any voice anymore,” said the Rev. A. Cecil Williams of Glide Memorial Church. “It involves a kind of power shift. That, of course, creates some of the tension.”

The rapidly deteriorating climate has alarmed local leaders. The president of the Board of Supervisors, David Chiu, noted that on Wednesday, hundreds of Chinese lined up at a board meeting to tell stories of assaults and intimidation, sometimes without clear motivation, by young African-Americans.

Two days later, a young black man, Amanze Emenike, 21, said he was 12 when he heard older boys talking about why they singled out Asian and Latino immigrants: they would not report the crime and had no gangs to back them up. On Friday morning, on a Hunters Point hilltop with a breathtaking view of the Bay, Mr. Emenike and his sister, Sherry Blunt, 22, recounted their “spree” of crime against Asian and Latino immigrants several years ago.

By the time he was 15, Mr. Emenike said, he and his brother, Armani Bolmer, would get up at 5 a.m. to rob Mexican day laborers who got off the 23 Monterey bus from the Mission district.

They began to single out Chinese, he said, because they had more money. In 2006, they stalked a Chinese man at the last Muni stop, robbed him, and were arrested hours later.

Black civic leaders say they are troubled by the rash of crimes and have repeatedly emerged at rallies alongside Chinese to show solidarity. They also point out that black-on-black crime remains, statistically, a far bigger problem.

But at these Chinese rallies and vigils, beneath the megaphone-amplified din of positive rhetoric, there are worrying murmurs about revenge, said Henry Der, who was the executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, an influential Chinatown organization, for more than two decades.

“I’m getting e-mails saying, ‘We need to retaliate, it’s time we pick up arms,’ ”Mr. Der said. “And these are from grown, supposedly responsible adults.”

At such a fraught time, leaders like Ms. Tan say they must tread a narrow path between irresponsibly amplifying racial tensions and dishonestly ignoring them.

Part of the frustration, some say, is fueled precisely by the reluctance — both among Chinese and among San Franciscans generally — to discuss such issues.

“Because San Francisco sees itself as very progressive, people just don’t want to talk about these issues,” Mr. Der said. “But that’s how people feel about it. You can’t argue it away.”

An alternative narrative, emerging from places like the Asian Law Caucus or the Rev. Amos Brown of the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter, argues that race played no role in the disparate attacks.

“They’re not the same perpetrators, and they’re not in the same neighborhood,” Angela Chan of the caucus said. “So it’s not a very advanced way of thinking about things.”

And the widow of Mr. Yu, Zhirui Wang, has repeatedly tried to play down any racial overtones in the attack on him, the Chinese-language press reported. “We are not separated by race or skin color,” she said in an interview with The World Journal. “I hope everyone can treat others as family members, so tragedy does not happen again.”

Mr. Emenike and his sister, Ms. Blunt, said the teenagers involved in the recent attacks were following in his footsteps, as he had followed older boys.

“It’s not ‘this is an Asian person let’s get him,’ ” Mr. Emenike said. “It’s we thinking, ‘this Asian person is probably carrying a large amount of money. And this is our neighborhood, this is our home, why not?’ ”

But if the motivations were largely strategic, and not out of unadulterated racial hatred, they were also influenced by complex emotions and a wariness of change.

“I wake up and I’m hungry, my stomach growling,” Ms. Blunt said. “Why am I just getting by when there’s this Asian walking out of the house with a laptop going to the cafe?”

There is also the frustration at perceived prejudice by Asians. Ms. Blunt still recalls a Chinese classmate in junior high ignoring her requests to borrow a pencil.

“You approach them, and they just keep giving you the cold shoulder,” Ms. Blunt said.

Last week, New America Media, a nonprofit coalition of ethnic news media outlets, published an essay in which Mr. Emenike talked of his past. It was soon translated and republished in both The Singtao Daily and The World Journal, the two main Chinese-language newspapers.

Mr. Emenike is a proud new father with a 3-month-old son, so he has “calmed down,” he said. He edits video for New America Media. He also projects an almost avuncular sense of responsibility for the teenagers in his neighborhood, and has come to terms — if grudgingly — with the changes there.

“We tell them that’s so played out, there’s no use anymore,” Mr. Emenike said. “They’re a part of the neighborhood, so it don’t make no sense to rob them. Like you see them everyday.”

(AP) — A grand jury has indicted a 16-year-old on hate crime charges in the shooting of a high school classmate inside a New York police station near baseball’s Hall of Fame.

The 16-year-old, Anthony Pacherille, now faces charges of attempted murder and attempted assault, both as hate crimes. He remains hospitalized with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and is scheduled for arraignment on May 7.

The authorities said Mr. Pacherille chased Wesley Lippitt, 16, from a park on April 2, shot him in the arm with his father’s .22-caliber rifle in the foyer of the police station and then shot himself through the chin.

Mr. Pacherille is white; Mr. Lippitt is black.

Then there is the young man that prosecutors, Latino advocates and even some of the jurors see: a gullible, aggressive teenager with a swastika tattoo on his thigh who stabbed Mr. Lucero in the chest that night out of anger, and then lied in court when he blamed someone else for the crime.

On the manslaughter charge, Mr. Conroy faces a minimum of eight years and a maximum of 25 years when he is sentenced by Justice Robert W. Doyle on May 26. His lawyer, William Keahon, says Mr. Conroy plans to appeal.

Mr. Conroy, in the one-hour interview on Monday, spoke of his love and concern for his family: After the guilty verdict was announced in the courtroom, Mr. Conroy recalled, he turned and saw two of his sisters in tears, and told them not to worry, that everything would be all right.

He spoke of the future he hoped to have with Ms. Suarez, a freshman at Stony Brook University: When she visited him on Saturday, they talked about one day getting married. (“We’re going to have three kids,” he said, smiling.) He spoke of the narrow jail cell where he spends 22 hours a day: “I can stretch both my arms and touch both walls.” And he spoke of praying in his cell, for his family and for Mr. Lucero’s family.

He says he feels sadness and sympathy for the Luceros, and spoke particularly of Mr. Lucero’s younger brother, Joselo Lucero, a presence in the courtroom throughout the trial. “I would just look at him and then I would look away,” Mr. Conroy said. “I feel bad for him. I got a brother, too. I couldn’t imagine him dying.”

Mr. Conroy had signed a five-page written confession to the police in which he admitted stabbing Mr. Lucero near the train station in Patchogue on Nov. 8, 2008, and bloodstains on the blade of the knife that the police found on him minutes after the stabbing matched Mr. Lucero’s DNA.

But at the trial, Mr. Conroy testified that he did not stab Mr. Lucero and that another teenager, Christopher Overton, told him that he was the one who stabbed Mr. Lucero. Mr. Conroy said in court that Mr. Overton asked him to take the knife because Mr. Overton was out on bail awaiting sentencing on a felony conviction.

Throughout the trial, Mr. Conroy emerged as a brazen, impulsive and, as his lawyer admitted to the jury, at times a foolish young man.

Mr. Conroy said he had his best friend give him a tattoo of a swastika on his thigh a few months before the stabbing “as a joke,” and because his friend had dared him to do it.

The day before the stabbing, Mr. Conroy got into a fight with another friend, because he was spreading rumors that Mr. Conroy had a sexually transmitted disease.

At the police precinct station house, a detective asked Mr. Conroy why he would fight one of his friends, and Mr. Conroy replied, “Same reason I’m here now,” because I’m a jerk, though Mr. Conroy used a more vulgar phrase, the detective testified.

Mr. Conroy was a 17-year-old senior at Patchogue-Medford High School at the time of the attack. He lived in Medford with his parents, three sisters and a brother. His mother, Lori Conroy, works at a bank and had taught Sunday school for seven years at her church.

His father, Robert Conroy, is a former Kmart assistant operations manager now on disability who is a leader in organizing youth sports in Medford and Patchogue.

In 2005, Robert Conroy co-founded a nonprofit youth sports league for children ages 5 to 13, and if his son had a second home, it was at the league’s athletic fields two miles from his house. Jeffrey Conroy was too old for the league when it started, but he helped his father care for the park and became a mentor to many of the children. He helped coach 11-year-old football players at age 16, and spent one summer improving one boy’s lacrosse skills, because the boy’s mother had asked him to help her son.

“At work I have to try to explain to people how this is that I know this kid and love this kid,” said Matthew Cleary, 40, a league board member and a family friend who works for the Long Island Rail Road. “I know a Jeffrey that when I was cutting the lawn he would come out and say, ‘I’ll finish.’ I know a Jeffrey that — that’s my 12-year-old son that looked up to him like a brother — and if he was to curse, Jeffrey would smack him off the back of the head and say, ‘Don’t curse, your mother’s upstairs.’ That’s the Jeffrey I know.”

Mr. Conroy grew up in the predominantly white middle-class towns and villages of eastern Long Island, but his experiences also had shades of diversity. He listened to Jay-Z, Nas and other black hip-hop artists. His half-sister from his father’s previous marriage is part Puerto Rican. One of his best friends is Turkish.

“I’m nothing like what the papers said about me,” Mr. Conroy said. “I’m not a white supremacist or anything like that. I’m not this serious racist kid everyone thinks I am.”

Under the state’s hate crime law, the prosecution was not required to prove Mr. Conroy was anti-Hispanic, but only that he had selected his victims because of their race or national origin.

The influx of day laborers, many of whom are illegal immigrants, has created racial tensions on eastern Long Island. Mr. Conroy said he never formed an opinion on the issue. “I don’t have any problems with it,” Mr. Conroy said.

He recounted confronting two white men outside a convenience store in October 2007 during his junior year in high school.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A Hispanic man had left a bicycle outside the store, and one of the white men had sat on the bike and released the kickstand as if he was about to take it away. The men were laughing. Mr. Conroy, a standout on his school’s wrestling team, said he warned them not to steal the bike, or that they would have a problem with him. He said he did so because he felt bad for the Hispanic man, whom he believed to be an immigrant day laborer.

“I guess he didn’t have a car or anything,” he said.

The trial made clear that Mr. Conroy was not, initially at least, the most aggressive of the teenagers on that November night. Mr. Conroy neither came up with the idea to go look for Hispanics to beat up, nor did he suggest driving to Patchogue to look for victims; one or more of the other teenagers did. He testified that his plan was to watch his six friends beat up a Hispanic person but not to take part in the fighting himself.

Mr. Cleary, the family friend, said it seemed as if Mr. Conroy was a follower at times, though he thought of himself as a leader.

“It’s a terrible Jekyll and Hyde story to me, and I don’t believe a lot of it,” Mr. Cleary said. “I believe that he got roped into events that others had started, and being 17 and filled with testosterone, sometimes you do things that get the best of you before you can think about it clearly.”

During the trial, prosecutors said that Mr. Conroy’s intent to kill was evident because the entire blade went into Mr. Lucero’s chest area and was stopped only by the handle. Mr. Lucero’s body was flown back to Ecuador, to his home village of Gualaceo, where he is buried in a municipal cemetery.

If Mr. Conroy were not in jail, he said he could imagine the life he would be leading: playing midfield on a college lacrosse team, either at the State University at Albany or at Plattsburgh. And his thigh would no longer have the swastika.

Romel’s bracing testimony on Thursday added few details to the emerging account of what happened that night. Speaking Spanish translated by an interpreter, Mr. Sucuzhañay said he remembered only parts of what happened, and at times, he gave conflicting information.

But the pain his few memories caused him hushed the courtroom, leaving defense lawyers little to do but apologize for questioning him or offer him condolences. The testimony caused several jurors to become emotional as well.

The trial is expected to last three weeks. Two separate juries are hearing the case, and on previous days, they heard from three witnesses, including a relative of one of the defendants, a livery-cab driver who was passing by, and an emergency medical technician who lived at Bushwick Avenue and Kossuth Place, where the attack occurred.

On Thursday, Mr. Sucuzhañay said he lives with his mother in Ecuador. He and a few of his brothers — there are 12 siblings in all — became well known to New Yorkers in the days after José was attacked, mostly for the sad vigil they kept at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens. As their mother made the journey from Ecuador to see José, who was on life-support machines, his heart stopped.

At the time, Romel had been visiting from Ecuador. José, who was younger, owned a real estate firm and several buildings. Romel worked with him, and testified that on the day of the attack, they collected rent from the buildings and finished work about 10:30 p.m.

Then they went out drinking, at a church party and later at a bar. Romel testified that he had three beers and a Long Island iced tea. His brother drank 10 or 11 beers, and half of the same cocktail.

As they walked home from the bar, José was “shaking from the cold,” he said. Romel gave him his jacket. Then they saw a sport utility vehicle at the corner of Bushwick and Kossuth.

In Romel’s account, the altercation started with a look: The driver of the S.U.V., who prosecutors said was Mr. Phoenix, stared at him. “We did not stop,” Romel said. Then two men got out of the vehicle, and Romel said he heard one or both of them — he could not say for sure — yelling insults about Hispanics.

It all happened “in a second, like a flash,” Mr. Sucuzhañay testified. A few minutes later, he shifted his attention from the interpreter, stared at Mr. Phoenix and pointed his finger at him.

Just then, a prosecutor, Josh Hanshaft, handed Mr. Sucuzhañay a photograph, and asked him to identify the man in the picture.

A second witness, Kimbale Taylor, testified Wednesday that she was awakened by the sounds of “banging and thumping” that morning. She said she looked out her bedroom window onto Kossuth Place, and across the street, in a scene brightly lighted by streetlamps, saw Mr. Phoenix with an aluminum bat.

Ms. Taylor, an emergency medical technician who later identified Mr. Phoenix in a lineup, said he hit José Sucuzhañay five times with the bat and then walked away. When Mr. Sucuzhañay lifted his hand, Mr. Phoenix walked back, she said, “to finish whatever he was doing.”

The two men on trial, Keith Phoenix, 30, and Hakim Scott, 26, have pleaded not guilty to charges including murder as a hate crime, and face up to life in prison if convicted. Prosecutors said Mr. Phoenix beat Mr. Sucuzhañay with the bat; he has said that he was defending himself because he thought Mr. Sucuzhañay was reaching for a weapon.

The killing occurred on Dec. 7, 2008, barely a month after another Ecuadorean, Marcelo Lucero, was stabbed to death in Patchogue, N.Y., on Long Island; in that case, a jury found a teenager guilty of manslaughter as a hate crime on Monday afternoon. While Mr. Lucero’s killing was feared to be part of a pattern of anti-Hispanic violence in Suffolk County, the attack on Mr. Sucuzhañay was seen as a tragic setback in an increasingly multicultural pocket of Brooklyn.

Condemnation from the city’s politicians came swiftly, and advocacy groups representing gays and Latinos quickly organized marches and vigils. The outrage only deepened after the arrests, when video footage was released showing Mr. Phoenix laughing in his car 19 minutes after the attack.

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/opinion/20tue4.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"A jury in Suffolk County, N.Y., has found Jeffrey Conroy guilty of manslaughter as a hate crime, after he fatally stabbed an Ecuadorean immigrant, Marcelo Lucero. Whatever solace the conviction brings to Mr. Lucero’s family, the shame for Suffolk County’s law enforcement and political leadership remains.

Mr. Conroy was part of a group of teenagers who rampaged through the village of Patchogue one night in November 2008. They surrounded Mr. Lucero near the train station, taunting and beating him. Mr. Lucero was not their only victim, but he was the only one who fought back, pulling off his belt and hitting Mr. Conroy in the head. Mr. Conroy stabbed Mr. Lucero in the chest, leaving him to die.

The case was the worst but hardly the only example of young Long Island men attacking Latinos for sport, which the police and other authorities failed for years to detect, prevent or punish.

Immigrants and their advocates had warned about the climate of fear, but the response from County Executive Steve Levy and the County Legislature was a series of misguided crackdowns on day-labor hiring and rental housing intended to uproot illegal immigrants, as if they were the only ones on the wrong side of the law. It took the Lucero case to refocus attention on immigrants as the victims of serious crimes, and to expose reports that the police had routinely ignored Latinos’ claims of racially motivated attacks — reports that prompted an ongoing federal investigation of the Suffolk County Police.

This should be the case that finally shames all communities into toning down the anti-immigrant fervor and insisting on effective, evenhanded law enforcement — policing that provides equal protection to everybody in the community, reaches out to undocumented immigrants who too often are afraid to speak out when they are victims and defends the humanity of all.

Suffolk, which has recently stepped up police training and outreach to Latinos, came late to this realization and Mr. Lucero paid the price. The rest of the country should not make the same mistake.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/nyregion/20patchogue.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Mr. Lucero’s death exposed racial tensions on eastern Long Island and caused a number of Hispanic residents to come forward saying they were the victims of harassment and assaults. Advocates for immigrants criticized the Suffolk County Police Department for failing to fully investigate complaints of assaults on Latinos, and also criticized some county leaders and politicians for fueling the hostility with anti-immigrant statements. Federal authorities are investigating the department’s handling of reports of racially motivated attacks on Hispanics.

Supporters of the Lucero family had told reporters privately in recent days that anything less than a murder conviction would be insulting, and would send the wrong message to Hispanics.

Outside the courtroom on Monday, some Latinos expressed disappointment, including a representative of Ecuador’s National Department of the Migrants, and the Rev. Allan B. Ramirez, the Ecuadorean pastor of Brookville Reformed Church and an advocate for immigrants, who is assisting the Lucero family.

“The message of manslaughter is that our lives are not worth very much,” Mr. Ramirez said.

Others, including Mr. Lucero’s brother, Joselo Lucero, said they were satisfied that justice had been done. “The hunting season is over, at least for now,” Joselo Lucero told reporters, a reference to the prosecution’s allegation that Mr. Conroy and his friends often hunted for Hispanic men to assault, an activity that the authorities said they referred to as “Mexican hopping.”

Prosecutors said Mr. Lucero, 37, who worked at a dry cleaning shop, was surrounded and attacked by Mr. Conroy and six others in a parking lot of the Patchogue train station shortly before midnight on Nov. 8, 2008. Mr. Lucero and a friend were walking to another friend’s house as the group approached.

The verdict came 11 days after Mr. Conroy took the stand to proclaim his innocence and blame another teenager for the stabbing, the most dramatic and puzzling moment in the trial. Mr. Conroy said that the other teenager, Christopher Overton, 17, told him that he had stabbed Mr. Lucero and had asked Mr. Conroy to take the knife.

Mr. Conroy testified that his five-page written confession to the police, in which he admitted stabbing Mr. Lucero, was a lie. He said in court that he lied to protect Mr. Overton, whom he had met for the first time earlier that evening, and because he did not realize at the time he was being questioned by the police that Mr. Lucero had died.

The jury’s verdict meant that they had agreed with one of the arguments made by Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon, that his client did not intend to kill Mr. Lucero. To convict Mr. Conroy of second-degree murder, the jury needed to find that he intended to kill Mr. Lucero, and to convict of first-degree manslaughter, they needed to find that Mr. Conroy caused Mr. Lucero’s death while intending to cause serious physical injury, not death.

Mr. Lucero was stabbed once in the chest. The knife did not penetrate the chest cavity or strike any major organs, but cut an artery and a large vein.

Three of the 12 jurors said in interviews outside the courthouse that the debate among them throughout four days of deliberations focused on Mr. Conroy’s intent, not on his claim of innocence. “We didn’t buy it at all,” said one juror, Michael Engel, 36, a Long Island Rail Road train conductor.

Mr. Engel and another juror, Eric Kramer, 42, an environmental engineer, said the phrase that sent the seven teenagers to Patchogue that night was important. “It was, ‘Let’s go beat up Mexican guys,’ ” Mr. Kramer said. “They never said, ‘Let’s go kill some guys, let’s go murder some guys.’ ”

The Suffolk County assistant district attorney prosecuting the case, Megan O’Donnell, said that Mr. Conroy’s intent to kill was evident, because the entire blade went into Mr. Lucero’s chest.

Ms. O’Donnell had told the jury that although Mr. Conroy did not appear intent on killing anyone when he climbed into the car with the six friends that night, in the moments before he stabbed Mr. Lucero, he did intend to kill him, she said, because Mr. Lucero had the audacity to fight back.

“That’s highly possible,” said another juror, Amy Lester, 44, an executive in a technology company. “But if you can’t prove it and we can’t see it, how could you know that?”

Mr. Conroy was the first defendant in the case to go on trial. Four of the teenagers pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted assault as a hate crime and other charges, and are cooperating with the authorities. The two others, including Mr. Overton, have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial. Mr. Overton’s lawyer has denied that his client stabbed Mr. Lucero.

Mr. Conroy had been on the high school wrestling, football and lacrosse teams. Several of his relatives and friends had long believed that he was innocent and that he had been falsely branded a white supremacist. Mr. Conroy had his best friend give him a tattoo of a swastika a few months before the stabbing — “as a joke,” he had testified. His father, Robert Conroy, said in a previous interview, “He’s not a monster.”

“You are officially members of the Thank God It’s Friday Club,” Justice Doyle told the jurors, moments before dismissing them for the weekend and asking them to return on Monday morning. “You’ve put in a full day.”

It was indeed a full day in the trial of the man, Jeffrey Conroy, who is accused of killing Mr. Lucero, in Patchogue in November 2008. The jurors began deliberations on Wednesday, after listening to testimony from more than two dozen witnesses since March 18. Mr. Conroy, 19, is accused of second-degree murder as a hate crime, gang assault and other charges.

Throughout the day, the jury asked for several items of evidence and for sections of testimony to be read back to them.

At 6 p.m., the jury sent a note to Justice Doyle saying that they wanted to hear the cross-examination of a key prosecution witness, Detective John A. McLeer. Justice Doyle told jurors that the extensive cross-examination would take two hours to two and a half hours to read.

It became not so much a deliberation as a marathon reading session.

At one point, the court officer standing next to the court reporter poured her a cup of water. Reporters munched on pizza near the vending machines; jurors had dinner brought in to them from an Italian restaurant. Roughly 20 court officers were working overtime securing the third-floor courtroom and areas outside it.

Three of them said they did not believe Mr. Conroy’s testimony, and one, Ms. Duck, said she found some parts believable.

Mr. Conroy took the witness stand last week. He testified that he had lied to the police in his five-page written confession, and that Christopher Overton, one of the six other teenagers who was with him that night, stabbed Mr. Lucero. Mr. Conroy said he lied to protect Mr. Overton and took the knife from him after the stabbing. Mr. Overton’s mother and lawyer have denied the accusation.

The alternate who said that Mr. Conroy was guilty of murder — Cathy Tidmarsh, 54, an airline reservations agent — said she did not believe, as Mr. Conroy had testified, that he did not plan on taking part in the fighting. Prosecutors said the seven teenagers had planned to go to Patchogue to look for a Hispanic person to beat up. “He was there,” Ms. Tidmarsh said. “He’s not along for the ride.”

One of the alternate jurors leaning toward manslaughter — Kosmas Hionidis, 44, a bus dispatcher — said he did not think that the seven young men accused of taking part in the attack intended to kill Mr. Lucero. In order for the jurors to convict Mr. Conroy on the second-degree murder charge, they must find that he intended to kill Mr. Lucero. To convict Mr. Conroy on the first-degree manslaughter charge, they must find that he caused Mr. Lucero’s death while intending to cause him serious physical injury.

“I don’t think this was a murder,” Mr. Hionidis said. “Nobody said, ‘We’re going to go kill him.’ ”

The other alternate who believed that Mr. Conroy was guilty of manslaughter, Judith Hallock, 70, a retired public school teacher, said it was clear that Mr. Conroy, not Mr. Overton, stabbed Mr. Lucero. Bloodstains on the blade of the knife that the police found on Mr. Conroy, as well as on two pieces of his clothing, matched the victim’s DNA.

“He did it,” Ms. Hallock said. “He made the choice. He carried the knife.” She added: “Excusing him for it is not going to make his life any better. As far as I’m concerned, it’d make a lot of other people’s lives a lot worse.”

The 12 jurors who remained to deliberate asked Justice Doyle for several pieces of evidence. They asked to read Mr. Conroy’s five-page written statement to the police, and were provided copies of it. They also asked for a portion of Nicholas Hausch’s testimony to be read to them. Mr. Hausch, one of the teenagers who was with Mr. Conroy that night, testified against him. The jurors also asked the judge to repeat the legal definitions of some of the charges against Mr. Conroy, including second-degree murder as a hate crime and first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime.",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Conroy took the witness stand last week and testified that in a five-page written confession he lied to the police to protect another teenager, and that he did so because he thought Mr. Lucero was not seriously injured. He said his plan had been to watch his six friends beat up a Hispanic person, but not to take part.

He said he had gotten into the car with the six others in Medford because he had wanted a ride to a friend’s house, but the teenager who was driving told him once they were on the road that he would drop him off after they went to Patchogue.

Ms. O’Donnell told the jury that Mr. Conroy wanted them to believe that the teenager who had been driving “kidnapped him and drove him to Patchogue instead.”

“How ridiculous is that?” she asked.

Mr. Conroy is on trial in State Supreme Court here, accused of second-degree murder as a hate crime, first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime and other charges. He has pleaded not guilty. On Tuesday, Mr. Conroy, a former star athlete at Patchogue-Medford High School, sat motionless a few steps from where Ms. O’Donnell spoke to the jury.

In his closing argument on Monday, Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon, said that no one who testified said they saw his client stab, punch or kick anyone that night, and he raised questions about both the physical evidence and the testimony of several witnesses.

Mr. Lucero was stabbed once in the chest, and the knife did not penetrate the chest cavity and did not strike any major organs. Mr. Keahon said if Mr. Conroy had intended to kill Mr. Lucero there should have been multiple stab wounds.

Ms. O’Donnell said the wound showed Mr. Conroy’s intent to kill. She said the former deputy chief medical examiner, who performed the autopsy, testified that the entire blade went into Mr. Lucero’s body.

The blade was “ stopped only by the handle, the hilt, of that knife,” Ms. O’Donnell said.

She added, “What does that speak of the defendant’s intent?”

The 12 jurors and 4 alternates had heard testimony from more than two dozen prosecution and defense witnesses since the first witness was called on March 18. Eight of those 16 jurors are men. One is black, one is Hispanic, and the rest are white.

Justice Robert W. Doyle told the jury on Tuesday that in addition to the original charges, it could also consider lesser charges, including the murder and manslaughter charges without the hate-crime elements, and second-degree manslaughter.

Most of the Hispanic men who testified were victims of alleged attacks.

The one who was not, Arturo Perez, has emerged as perhaps the prosecution’s key witness. One of the teenagers with Mr. Conroy that night, Nicholas Hausch, 18, told the court that before they went to Patchogue, he and the six others drove to a wooded area near his home in Medford looking for Hispanic men to beat up, but found none.

Mr. Conroy said in his testimony that they never went there.

Mr. Perez, a neighbor of Mr. Hausch’s, took the stand the day after Mr. Conroy testified. Mr. Perez said he saw Mr. Hausch that night coming out of the woods with a group of boys.

Mr. Keahon had little to say on Monday about Mr. Perez’s testimony. “I don’t have an explanation,” he said.

He said he got in the car because he wanted a ride to a friend’s house, and that once they parked looking for someone to assault, he did not want to wait in the car by himself because it would be boring.

Mr. Conroy made a written confession to the police hours after the stabbing. But in testimony last week, he said he had lied to protect Mr. Overton, who told him that he was awaiting sentencing on a previous case.

For now, it is impossible to know what the jury thought of Mr. Conroy’s testimony, in which he accused the lead detective in the case of lying and of making up parts of the confession.

On Monday, Mr. Keahon seemed to take this uncertainty into account, as he argued that the wound itself illustrated that Mr. Conroy did not intend to kill or seriously hurt Mr. Lucero.

In order for the jury to convict on the second-degree murder charge, they must find that Mr. Conroy intended to kill Mr. Lucero, and to convict on first-degree manslaughter, they must find that Mr. Conroy caused the death of a person while intending to cause serious physical injury.

Mr. Lucero was stabbed once in the chest, below the collarbone. The knife did not penetrate the chest cavity and struck no major organs, running parallel to the skin, though it did cut an artery and a large vein. “It was never straight in,” Mr. Keahon said of the wound, adding, “How is a wound like that intending to cause death? There’s no organ there.”

Mr. Keahon repeated one of his central themes throughout the trial. Nearly 40 minutes elapsed from the time a 911 call went through to the time Mr. Lucero arrived at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center, though the hospital is about three miles from where Mr. Lucero was found. Mr. Keahon said Mr. Lucero should not have died from the wound.

Jurors struggling with the intent issue will have a third option: Justice Robert W. Doyle will tell them on Tuesday, after the prosecution makes closing arguments, that they can consider a lesser charge of second-degree manslaughter.

A conviction of second-degree manslaughter requires a finding that someone recklessly caused the death of another.

Mr. Keahon admitted at one point that some of the things his client said on the stand “were stupid,” adding of Mr. Conroy’s decision not to wait in the car alone: “Should he have been there with them? No.”

Monday would have been Mr. Lucero’s 39th birthday, and his brother and sister sat in the gallery with other supporters. Fernando Mateo, a family spokesman, was asked by reporters what he thought of Mr. Keahon’s remarks.

He said he had given the false confession to protect one of the other teenagers, Christopher Overton, who was out on bail awaiting sentencing on a burglary conviction. But Mr. Conroy said he was not aware then that Mr. Lucero had died. Mr. Conroy said Mr. Overton had told him, “I only nicked him. And I’ll promise you he’s not hurt.”

Mr. Conroy also said he met Mr. Overton only hours earlier that night and his testimony was the first time he was publicly revealing the truth.

In his testimony, Mr. Conroy also accused a veteran Suffolk County police detective, John A. McLeer, of lying to the jury and writing in sentences in Mr. Conroy’s five-page confession that he did not say. He also testified that he had no intention of going to Patchogue to beat up Mexicans, though he said he knew that the six teenagers he was with were going there to do just that.

Asked by Megan O’Donnell, the assistant district attorney prosecuting the case, why he did not simply wait in the car while his friends went looking for people to assault, Mr. Conroy replied: “I wasn’t going to wait in the car by myself. Because it was boring. I don’t know.”

Justice Robert W. Doyle told the jurors not to consider the truth or falsity of what Mr. Conroy said Mr. Overton had told him, but to use the testimony only as a way of understanding Mr. Conroy’s state of mind.

Mr. Overton, 17, has pleaded not guilty to gang assault and other charges. His lawyer, Paul Gianelli, has said that Mr. Overton did not stab Mr. Lucero, and that Mr. Conroy is using his client as a scapegoat.

Inside the courtroom in State Supreme Court, the prosecution had called a forensic scientist, a former deputy chief medical examiner, homicide detectives and other police officers. And yet, perhaps the prosecution’s most important witness took the stand on Friday, a man with no title whom few in the courtroom had ever heard of. The man, Arturo Perez, is a neighbor of Nicholas Hausch, 18, another of the teenagers, who pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted assault as a hate crime and other charges.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Hausch had testified in the trial that earlier on the night of the killing, he and the six others drove to a wooded area near his home in Medford looking for Hispanic men to attack, because he thought the homeless people who lived there were Latino. Mr. Conroy said in his testimony that they never went there.

Mr. Perez, a rebuttal witness, testified that as he was driving home shortly after 11 p.m., he saw Mr. Hausch coming out of the woods with a group of other youths. “I slowed down a little bit,” Mr. Perez said. “He acknowledged me. I acknowledged him.” He said one member of the group was dark-skinned, and the rest were white. Six of the teenagers charged in the attack are white; one is black and Hispanic.

For weeks, reporters covering the trial had been trying to discern the strategy of Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon. During his opening argument, Mr. Keahon did not say that his client would testify that another teenager had stabbed Mr. Lucero. But he did tell the jury that Mr. Conroy pleaded not guilty in November 2008, and he had continued to plead not guilty ever since. In questioning prosecution witnesses, he often mentioned Mr. Overton and his burglary conviction.

Mr. Keahon said in an interview that Mr. Conroy first told him that he was innocent and that Mr. Overton was the one who stabbed Mr. Lucero in November 2008. “I never disclose what my defense is,” Mr. Keahon said. “I think any lawyer that does is incompetent. I built my defense from Day 1 of the trial. I told no one what my defense was. I didn’t tell other lawyers. I didn’t tell friends. I didn’t tell anyone.”

Mr. Keahon, 65, a former prosecutor, has been a forceful, unpredictable litigator.

He has twice asked, unsuccessfully, for Justice Doyle to declare a mistrial on technicalities. During jury selection, he argued that a black cloth that covered part of the defense table cast his client in an ominous light. It was a sheet that prevents jurors from seeing a defendant’s shackles, which Mr. Conroy has not worn in court. Mr. Keahon asked the judge to have it removed, saying that if it was screwed in he could bring in the tools to remove it himself.

Mr. Conroy said he took the knife, washed it off in a puddle and put it in the waistband of his boxers, where it was found when a Suffolk County police officer patted him down. Mr. Conroy met Mr. Overton for the first time earlier that evening, just a few hours before. Why, he was asked by Megan O’Donnell, the assistant district attorney handling the case, would he take a murder charge for someone he had just met, and why did he take the knife?

Mr. Conroy said that when he gave the police a five-page written statement — in which he confessed to stabbing the immigrant, Marcelo Lucero — he did not know that Mr. Lucero had died. He added that he took the knife “because he told me; I felt bad for him.”

Testimony from defendants accused of murder is a rare event these days. Mr. Conroy’s appearance in State Supreme Court was rarer still: in about three and a half hours of questioning by Ms. O’Donnell and the defense lawyer, William Keahon, Mr. Conroy accused the lead homicide detective on the case of lying to the jury and making up several sections of Mr. Conroy’s confession.

Mr. Conroy added that his testimony on Thursday — 17 months after the stabbing — was the first time that he was publicly revealing the truth.

He gave the jury an alternate version of what happened in Patchogue, N.Y., shortly before midnight on Nov. 8, 2008, describing Mr. Lucero as the aggressor. Prosecutors and other witnesses have told the jury that Mr. Lucero took off his denim jacket and belt after he was punched in the face by one of the teenagers, and began swinging the belt over his head.

On Thursday, Mr. Conroy said that Mr. Lucero chased the seven young men into a parking lot of a train station as he swung the belt.

“No one wanted to get hit with the belt,” Mr. Conroy testified, adding later that Mr. Lucero could have left, “but he chased us to the parking lot.”

Mr. Conroy said that as he stood in the parking lot, he heard Mr. Lucero’s friend, Angel Loja, who was with him, screaming something, and Mr. Conroy turned to look at him. When he turned back, he said he saw Mr. Overton and Mr. Lucero separate, and it was then that Mr. Overton told him that he stabbed Mr. Lucero.

Mr. Conroy said he had no intention of going to Patchogue to look for Mexicans to fight, as prosecutors allege. He said that he got in the car with the other boys only because he wanted a ride to a friend’s house, and that when the young man who was driving told him he would drop him off after they went to Patchogue, “I just let it go.”

Bloodstains on the blade of the knife, as well as on the tank top and jeans Mr. Conroy was wearing, matched Mr. Lucero’s DNA. A DNA analysis on the handle of the knife was inconclusive; a forensic scientist who testified earlier said he could not exclude Mr. Conroy or Mr. Lucero as contributors to the DNA on it, though he said the other defendants, including Mr. Overton, could be ruled out.

Ms. O’Donnell asked Mr. Conroy if he had washed off Mr. Overton’s DNA in the puddle. “Guess so, yeah,” Mr. Conroy said.

Mr. Conroy faces several charges, including second-degree murder as a hate crime and first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime.

Mr. Conroy, now 19, sat unsmiling and staring straight ahead for much of his testimony. In the gallery were Mr. Lucero’s relatives, including his mother, brother and sister, along with members of Mr. Conroy’s family. Thomas J. Spota, the Suffolk County district attorney, sat in the first row. A few rows back sat Mr. Overton’s mother, Denise Overton.

Outside the courtroom, Ms. Overton said her son did not stab anyone and that Mr. Conroy was lying on the witness stand. “He has no conscience whatsoever,” she said.

Mr. Overton, 17, has pleaded not guilty to gang assault and other charges.

Justice Doyle ruled on Wednesday that Mr. Conroy’s conversations with Mr. Overton were hearsay and were not admissible. The judge said the statements suggested that Mr. Overton had stabbed Mr. Lucero, when other evidence pointed to Mr. Conroy. Justice Doyle rejected admitting the statements as evidence, but was considering whether to accept them under a different legal argument. He was expected to give his ruling on Thursday.

The other highlight of the day involved a prisoner screening report prepared shortly after Mr. Conroy was brought to the jail. In it, Mr. Conroy described himself as a white supremacist and told jail personnel that he had been “raised in a home where his parents held racist beliefs,” Justice Doyle said from the bench. Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon, did not want the report admitted as evidence, but the judge allowed it. Mr. Keahon said Mr. Conroy never made those statements.

More than three hours after Mr. Lucero and a friend were attacked near the train station in Patchogue shortly before midnight, on Nov. 8, 2008, Mr. Conroy sat in a 9-by-9-foot interview room at a police precinct and helped a homicide detective write the statement. “I continued to run towards him and stabbed him once in either his shoulder or chest,” the statement read.

Mr. Conroy faces charges including second-degree murder as a hate crime and first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime.

In his questioning of witnesses, Mr. Keahon succeeded in raising questions about Mr. Conroy’s participation in the attack. The detective who interviewed Mr. Conroy, John A. McLeer, said Mr. Conroy did not mention using any racial slurs during the attack.

“Chris and I were being quiet,” Mr. Conroy said in the statement, referring to Mr. Overton; some of the other young men called Mr. Lucero and his friend beaners and Mexicans.

Prosecutors said Mr. Conroy and the six other teenagers attacked Mr. Lucero and a friend on Nov. 8, 2008, in Patchogue after hunting for Hispanic men to assault, an activity the authorities and one of the teenagers who testified said they called “beaner hopping.” Mr. Conroy is the first defendant to go on trial. Four of the teenagers have pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted assault as a hate crime and other charges, and are cooperating with the authorities. Two others have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.

On Monday, the statement was read by Detective McLeer during Mr. Conroy’s trial in State Supreme Court here as Mr. Conroy, in a gray suit, sat a few feet away with his lawyer at a table facing the witness stand.

It was the third time in the trial that the jury had heard from a witness who testified that Mr. Conroy said he had stabbed someone. The police officer who patted down Mr. Conroy that night said that Mr. Conroy told him, “I stabbed him.” One of the teenagers who pleaded guilty, Nicholas Hausch, told the court that as they were fleeing, Mr. Conroy told him that he had stabbed one of the men.

The attack occurred shortly before midnight. By 3:30 a.m., Mr. Conroy was in an interview room at a police station house speaking to Detective McLeer and another detective. He was interviewed three times on Nov. 9 for a total of roughly four hours. Mr. Conroy’s statement to the police was handwritten by Detective McLeer, who testified that Mr. Conroy reviewed it, signed it and dated it.

In the statement, Mr. Conroy said that he and his friends were at a park that evening when one of the defendants suggested that they go looking for Mexicans to assault. They drove to Patchogue and were walking near the train station when they came upon two men, Mr. Lucero, 37, and his friend, Angel Loja.

“They were older than us,” Mr. Conroy said, according to the statement that was read. One of the seven teenagers told the men that he had a gun, and told them to hand over their money, though he was really unarmed. Mr. Lucero started swinging his belt, and Mr. Conroy said in the statement that one of the teenagers called out to surround him. Mr. Conroy said that he had told Mr. Hausch that he stabbed him and, referring to the knife, “I tried to wash the blood off in a puddle.”

Under cross-examination, Detective McLeer was asked by Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon, if it was true that Mr. Conroy spent a total of 31 hours at the station house starting on Nov. 9. “I’m not certain of the hours,” the detective replied, adding, “I wouldn’t dispute that number.” Mr. Conroy used the bathroom for the first time after being at the station house for 11 hours, Detective McLeer testified, reading from a prisoner activity log.

The detective testified that Mr. Conroy did not mention using any racial slurs during the attack, but that Mr. Conroy said that some of the other teenagers had called the two men “beaners” and “Mexicans.”

Mr. Keahon asked Detective McLeer whether he had ever asked Mr. Conroy if he had intended to kill Mr. Lucero and if he had intended to cause him serious physical injury. Detective McLeer said he did not. “I believe that a person’s actions speak their intent,” he replied.

He is a friend of Jeffrey Conroy, the teenager accused of stabbing and killing Mr. Lucero as part of a hate crime. Both teenagers were students at Patchogue-Medford High School in the class of 2009.

Mr. Garcia recalled, for example, that six months before the stabbing, Mr. Conroy sat on Mr. Garcia’s porch with a few other boys, wishing him a happy birthday and working out with weights. “Just laughing, talking, joking around,” Mr. Garcia said.

Mr. Lucero’s death and its aftermath have been one of the most divisive episodes on Long Island in recent memory. The stabbing revealed tensions between whites and Hispanics in Suffolk County, prompted many Latinos to come forward claiming they were frequent targets of harassment and assaults, and raised questions about the county Police Department’s response to reports of crimes against Latinos.

Caught in the middle of all this has been Mr. Garcia, who lives within blocks of where Mr. Lucero was stabbed in a parking lot of the Long Island Rail Road train station here.

Mr. Garcia has his feet in two worlds seemingly at odds with each other: He continues to support Mr. Conroy’s claim of innocence and says he believes that his friend has been falsely branded a white supremacist, and yet he also supports the views of many in the Hispanic community that the attack was but one example of the racial and ethnic hatred they face on a daily basis.

He said that both he and his father had been spit on by white youths, and that a few weeks ago, as his 14-year-old brother was riding a skateboard outside their apartment, an older white man in a yellow car slowed down, laughed and shouted that Mexicans don’t skateboard.

“I chased the car,” Mr. Garcia said. “I was so mad. There’s a lot of racism going on around here.”

He has stayed in touch with Mr. Conroy’s friends and relatives as Mr. Conroy’s hate-crime trial proceeds in State Supreme Court in nearby Riverhead, yet Mr. Garcia also met Mr. Lucero’s brother, Joselo, after he spoke at a local church.

Yet he also describes Mr. Conroy as one of his closest friends.

“How’s he going to be a white supremacist if he chills with Spanish people and he chills with black people?” Mr. Garcia said. “He’s my friend. He’s been there for me. I’ve been there for him. He wasn’t a racist.”

Mr. Garcia said that he was not there that November night, and that only the seven young men who were know what really happened in the parking lot.

What he does know, Mr. Garcia said, is that Mr. Conroy, whom he has known for nearly six years and befriended after they met in Spanish class freshman year, never said anything anti-Hispanic to him.

Other boys at the school did.

“There would be kids, and you would walk and they would bump into you and then say, ‘Oh, you Mexican,’ ‘you beaner,’ ” Mr. Garcia said. “Jeff was never like that. He’s never said anything disrespectful to me.”

Mr. Conroy, now 19, faces several charges in connection with Mr. Lucero’s stabbing and attempted attacks on three other Hispanic men, including second-degree murder as a hate crime and gang assault. In recent days, the prosecution has been calling witnesses to testify in the trial, which is being heard by 12 jurors and 4 alternates in Justice Robert W. Doyle’s courtroom.

Prosecutors have said Mr. Conroy and six other Patchogue-Medford High School students attacked Mr. Lucero and a friend shortly before midnight on Nov. 8, 2008, part of a series of assaults singling out Hispanic men.

A Suffolk County police officer who patted down Mr. Conroy that night and found a knife on him testified that Mr. Conroy told him, “I stabbed him.”

Bloodstains on the blade of the knife matched Mr. Lucero’s DNA.

The Rev. Allan B. Ramirez, the Ecuadorean pastor of Brookville Reformed Church and an immigrant advocate helping the Lucero family, said the fact that Mr. Conroy had an Ecuadorean friend illustrated the complexities of the racial dynamics in this case, but did not change his opinion about Mr. Conroy’s guilt.

“There are a lot of racist people out there who live quote-unquote everyday, normal lives,” he said. “They’re not going to walk around saying 24 hours a day, ‘I’m a racist.’ The fact that he had an Ecuadorean friend could be seen simply as a way of hiding his hatred for Latinos. What better way to hide his racism.”

The authorities said the seven teenagers hunted for Hispanic men to attack, as part of an activity they referred to as “beaner-hopping,” a practice that incited outrage and helped thrust Mr. Lucero’s stabbing into the spotlight.

If the seven defendants went “beaner-hopping” that night, as prosecutors allege, they were not the first to do so, and they invented neither the term nor the crime. Mr. Garcia and other former students at the high school said they had heard of students boasting of going “beaner-hopping” for years before November 2008. “I’ve heard that word since fifth grade,” said Mr. Garcia, who added that he never heard Mr. Conroy use it.

Though he has occasionally spoken to others of their friendship, he has largely kept his connection to Mr. Conroy to himself and has not attended the trial, as several other of Mr. Conroy’s young friends have. “I’m just trying to stay away from everything,” Mr. Garcia said.

Mr. Garcia graduated from the high school and now works two jobs: he washes dishes at a restaurant and does maintenance at a church. He said he was trying to save money to go to Suffolk County Community College.

One recent afternoon, Mr. Garcia walked through the parking lot, to the long driveway where Mr. Lucero was found by the police that night. Wrapped around the top of the chain-link fence at the entrance of the driveway was a rosary with a small plastic cross on it.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/nyregion/01patchogue.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"On Wednesday, the forensic scientist, Robert Baumann, who works for the Suffolk County Crime Laboratory, said the bloodstains found on the jeans were on the back of the right leg of the pants, just below the back pocket and running down the leg. The handle of the knife recovered from Mr. Conroy showed DNA from two people on it, and Mr. Baumann said he could not exclude either Mr. Conroy or Mr. Lucero as contributors.

None of Mr. Lucero’s blood was found on Mr. Conroy’s sweatshirt, and none on the front of his jeans, Mr. Baumann testified.

The jury in the case in State Supreme Court here also heard for the first time from Dr. Stuart Dawson, who performed the autopsy on Mr. Lucero for the Suffolk County medical examiner’s office. Dr. Dawson told the jury that the cause of death was a stab wound to the chest.

The autopsy report and Dr. Dawson’s testimony showed that Mr. Lucero was not beaten or stabbed repeatedly. The only significant injuries were cuts on his upper and lower lips that probably came from a single punch, and a stab wound just below the collarbone that did not penetrate the chest cavity and ran parallel to the skin, said Dr. Dawson, a former deputy chief medical examiner who has since retired. No major organs were struck, but Mr. Lucero’s right axillary artery and an adjacent large vein were cut, according to the report and Dr. Dawson’s testimony.

Dr. Dawson said a toxicology report found cocaine, marijuana and alcohol in Mr. Lucero’s system. He described the cocaine and marijuana levels as low and said the alcohol consumed put Mr. Lucero “right at the levels of intoxication or just short of it.”

The time it took the volunteer Patchogue Ambulance Company to take Mr. Lucero to the hospital that night has played a role in Mr. Conroy’s defense. Nearly 40 minutes elapsed from when the 911 call was made, 11:55 p.m., to when Mr. Lucero arrived at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center, 12:34 a.m. The hospital is about three miles from where Mr. Lucero was found.

An assistant chief with the ambulance company testified earlier that the crew took Mr. Lucero to a nearby landing zone to be airlifted. When Mr. Lucero went into cardiac arrest, the crew instead took him to Brookhaven, stopping to pick up a paramedic.

Until then, no one in the ambulance had been qualified to give a patient an IV, though there were IVs in the ambulance and Mr. Lucero was in shock from blood loss, said the assistant chief, Chris Schiera. Mr. Schiera said his E.M.T. certification had lapsed at the time, preventing him from administering an IV.

Dr. Dawson told Megan O’Donnell, the assistant district attorney handling the case, that he had reviewed Mr. Schiera’s testimony, but that his opinion about the cause of death had not changed.

But Dr. Dawson said under cross-examination that the essence of Mr. Lucero’s situation after he had been stabbed was “loss of blood volume.”

Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon, asked Dr. Dawson if no one on the ambulance crew was certified to hook up an IV, would the best actions have been to put pressure on the wound and rush him to Brookhaven. Dr. Dawson said the question put him in the position of an emergency responder.

Later that evening, Mr. Hausch and six other young men saw two Hispanic men walking in a parking lot of the train station in Patchogue. “We were calling them names like ‘beaner,’ ‘Mexican,’ ” Mr. Hausch testified. “They started screaming back.”

One of the Hispanic men took off his jacket and belt after one of the teenagers punched him in the face, and the man started swinging the belt, Mr. Hausch said. “He came after me with the belt, and I walked away,” he said. As Mr. Hausch did so, he testified, one of the seven teenagers, Jeffrey Conroy, walked past him, and told him that they had to leave.

“That’s when he told me that he stabbed him,” Mr. Hausch said referring to Mr. Conroy.

The man who was stabbed, a 37-year-old Ecuadorean immigrant named Marcelo Lucero, would die, and Mr. Conroy would be charged with killing him. Mr. Hausch’s testimony on Monday in Mr. Conroy’s trial was one of the first times that any of the seven young men charged in the attack had spoken publicly at length about the episode.

Mr. Conroy, now 19, is accused of second-degree murder as a hate crime, gang assault and other charges. He could face up to life in prison.

For all of the outrage and controversy the attack caused on Long Island, Mr. Hausch, short and skinny and wearing a dark suit, described the attacks on Hispanics in a matter-of-fact fashion. He was not asked if he had remorse, and he was not asked for, and did not offer, an explanation about why he singled out Hispanics.

Under questioning by Megan O’Donnell, the Suffolk County assistant district attorney handling the case, Mr. Hausch said that prosecutors had not made him any promises based on his testimony. Mr. Hausch had attended Patchogue-Medford High School with Mr. Conroy, whom he described as a friend, though he said the two were not close.

Mr. Hausch said that Mr. Conroy, moments after the stabbing, had the knife out and that there was blood on it. “We were telling him to throw the knife,” Mr. Hausch testified. He said that Mr. Conroy kept the knife, and told Mr. Hausch that he had washed it in a puddle.

Mr. Hausch said that he did not see Mr. Conroy punch, kick or stab Mr. Lucero. He also said that he did not remember Mr. Conroy yelling any anti-Hispanic slurs as the teens approached Mr. Lucero and his friend, Angel Loja.

Mr. Hausch said that it was another teenager, Kevin Shea, not Mr. Conroy, who told the others to surround Mr. Lucero.

Mr. Hausch said that Mr. Lucero became the aggressor at one point. Under cross-examination, he told Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon, that after Mr. Shea punched Mr. Lucero in the face, the group started turning to walk away because Mr. Lucero was bleeding after just one punch. When Mr. Lucero began swinging his belt, Mr. Hausch said the group backed away.

“You guys had already decided to retreat?” Mr. Keahon asked.

“Yes,” Mr. Hausch replied.

Mr. Hausch said that other than Mr. Shea’s punch, he did not see anyone else hit Mr. Lucero.

In her opening statement this month, Ms. O’Donnell had told the jury that Mr. Conroy had boasted to friends immediately after the stabbing, “Imagine if I get away with this.” On Monday, Mr. Hausch testified that someone in the group made that comment, but he did not know who did, and later told Mr. Keahon that the person who said it was not Mr. Conroy.",nytimes.com,True

And though prosecutors say Mr. Conroy, 19, admitted to the police that he stabbed Mr. Lucero, his trial on second-degree murder as a hate crime focused one day this week on another issue: the precise slurs that the teenagers are accused of using.

Mr. Loja testified on Wednesday that the group called them “Mexicans” and “illegals” and used racial and ethnic slurs against blacks and Hispanics. In his testimony before the grand jury and in his signed statement to the police in November 2008, he said the attackers used a racial epithet, but he made no mention of their using “Mexicans,” “illegals” or a Hispanic slur. It was a point that Mr. Conroy’s lawyer stressed throughout much of his nearly four-hour cross-examination of Mr. Loja.

The exchange between the attackers and Mr. Loja and Mr. Lucero seemed to be as much about race as class, or even economics.

“You come to this country to take our money from us,” Mr. Loja said someone in the group told them. Mr. Loja worked in construction; Mr. Lucero worked in a dry-cleaning store. When one of the teenagers asked him for money, Mr. Lucero replied that they should work, as he did, so that they could have money, too, Mr. Loja testified.

At one point, Mr. Loja said he told the teenager who is black and Hispanic, Jose Pacheco, “I’m the same color as you.” He also admitted in court that he had used a racial slur to refer to Mr. Pacheco after, he said, Mr. Pacheco used the slur against him.

The indelicate, intricate details that have come to light in Long Island’s first trial on murder as a hate crime have complicated a case that exposed racial tensions in Suffolk County and prompted numerous Hispanics to come forward to describe episodes of harassment and assaults.

“A lot of hate-crime trials are gray in this way,” said Mark Potok, a director at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit Alabama-based organization that tracks hate groups. The center issued a report in 2009 about racial intolerance in Suffolk County.

“It’s really a jury call,” Mr. Potok added. “Oftentimes, whether or not a crime is a hate crime turns on very fine points of the evidence.”

Mr. Potok said he saw no contradictions in the fact that Mr. Pacheco is black and Hispanic and that Mr. Conroy has black and Hispanic friends. Mr. Potok spoke of a white supremacist gang in California called the Nazi Low Riders that has many members who are Latino or have Latina companions.

“These kinds of contradictions are much more common than anyone expects,” Mr. Potok said. “When I look at this group of defendants, I wouldn’t be looking for ideological consistency. I think that the idea that Latino immigrants were somehow disposable people was in the atmosphere in Suffolk County and very much sunk into these kids’ brains. It’s not so much that they’re following a strict ideology. In a sense, the community around them has identified a group of people who are somehow less.”

Mr. Conroy has pleaded not guilty. Four of the seven, including Mr. Pacheco, have pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted assault as a hate crime and other charges, and are cooperating with the authorities. The two others have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.

Despite the racially charged atmosphere surrounding the case, the trial has unfolded in quiet, low-key fashion in the criminal courthouse. One day, in a hallway, Mr. Conroy’s parents, Robert and Lori Conroy, spoke briefly with Mr. Lucero’s brother, Joselo Lucero, and the Rev. Allan B. Ramirez, an immigrant advocate assisting the Lucero family. The Conroys told Joselo Lucero that his family had been in their prayers.

Ms. Suarez, 20, has visited Mr. Conroy in jail, and she said in an interview that she believed Mr. Conroy was innocent and had been falsely demonized as a hate-filled young man. Ms. Suarez, who attended Patchogue-Medford High School with Mr. Conroy, dated him on and off for about four years. In that time, she said, Mr. Conroy never said anything anti-Hispanic to her.

“He didn’t care what you were,” she said. “They’re saying that he’s a supremacist. It’s not true. It’s not him. He’s a very loving person.”

Ms. Suarez, now a freshman at Stony Brook University, said she had no plans to testify, saying she did not want to put herself or her family in the spotlight.

Another of Mr. Conroy’s friends, Keith Brunjes, 18, did testify, describing how one day in 2008 he drew a swastika tattoo on Mr. Conroy, using a needle, ink and thread. Asked in court if he had given himself any tattoos, Mr. Brunjes said he had. There was one on Mr. Brunjes’s arm. It read “One Love.”",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Loja gave his testimony on Wednesday in the hate-crime trial of the Long Island teenager prosecutors have charged with fatally stabbing Mr. Lucero that evening. The teenager, Jeffrey Conroy, 19, is accused of second-degree murder as a hate crime, gang assault and other charges. The authorities said Mr. Conroy was one of seven Patchogue-Medford High School students who attacked Mr. Lucero as part of the sport they called “beaner hopping” or “Mexican hopping.” Mr. Conroy has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Mr. Loja’s testimony was the most dramatic moment in the trial so far, and was the first time that a witness had recounted the attackers’ racial and ethnic epithets.

Wearing a dark suit and seated on the witness stand in a courtroom in State Supreme Court here, Mr. Loja said that as the group approached, someone asked Mr. Lucero for money.

Mr. Loja said his friend told them that they should work, as he did, so that they could have money, too. With that, the group separated, Mr. Loja said, with three of them coming after him and the rest surrounding and kicking his friend. Moments later, the boys fled, and Mr. Loja asked Mr. Lucero if he was all right.

“He said, ‘No, Angel, I’m not; call the ambulance,’ ” Mr. Loja testified.

Mr. Loja testified that he did not see his friend get stabbed, and although Mr. Loja identified Mr. Conroy and his friends as the attackers later that night, he did not identify Mr. Conroy as one of them in court on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, another Hispanic man whom prosecutors say the seven teenagers tried to attack earlier that November evening also failed to identify Mr. Conroy, saying that he did not get a clear enough look at their faces.

Under a vigorous and at times tense cross-examination by Mr. Conroy’s lawyer that lasted nearly four hours, Mr. Loja on Wednesday gave confusing and occasionally contradictory answers.

He told the grand jury in 2008 that at one point, Mr. Lucero chased the boys as he swung his belt, but on Wednesday, he appeared to back away from that statement.

“I might have said it, but it’s not the way it is,” Mr. Loja told Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon. “Do you know what I mean?”

During his cross-examination, Mr. Keahon pointed out that Mr. Loja’s three-page signed statement to the police never mentions the young men calling them “illegals,” “Mexicans” or a Hispanic epithet. Mr. Loja responded: “No, from the very beginning, I told them. If they didn’t write it down, I don’t know why.” The statement did include Mr. Loja’s claim that he and Mr. Lucero were called a different racial slur.

Mr. Loja gave most of his answers in Spanish, and an interpreter stood to his side and translated the questions for him as well as his answers to the jury. Mr. Loja testified that he came to the United States illegally in 1994 and that he bought identification documents using a fake date of birth and a fake name, Pablo Loja.

The Rev. Allan B. Ramirez, an advocate for immigrants on Long Island who has been attending the trial with Mr. Lucero’s brother, Joselo Lucero, took exception to Mr. Keahon’s questioning. “It is unfair to expect Angel, who has just seen his friend butchered in front of his eyes, to recollect minute details of what was taking place,” he said outside the courtroom.",nytimes.com,True

A Suffolk County prosecutor, Megan O’Donnell, told jurors last week that Mr. Conroy’s views on white supremacy were evident in the tattoos on his body and in the statements he made to others. Shortly after Mr. Lucero’s stabbing, Steve Levy, the county executive, called the seven defendants white supremacists.

Mr. Brunjes’s testimony on Tuesday appeared to raise more questions than answers about Mr. Conroy’s mind-set.

Mr. Brunjes, who has known Mr. Conroy since they were both about 8 years old, said he and Mr. Conroy did not have any conversations about why Mr. Conroy wanted a swastika, and he also testified that Mr. Conroy did not discuss the meaning of the lightning bolt. When Mr. Brunjes modified the lightning bolt tattoo, it resembled the logo of the Gatorade sports drink, Mr. Brunjes said in court.

But another young friend of Mr. Conroy’s testified on Tuesday that Mr. Conroy came to her house about a month before the stabbing and showed her the lightning bolt. The friend, Alyssa Sprague, 17, told him at the time that she thought it was the Gatorade logo. “He said, no, it was white power,” Ms. Sprague testified.

After Mr. Brunjes gave Mr. Conroy the swastika tattoo, Mr. Brunjes testified, Mr. Conroy told him, “If I ever go to jail, I’m screwed.”

Mr. Conroy, now 19, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder as a hate crime as well as other charges. He was 17 when Mr. Brunjes gave him the swastika, which Mr. Brunjes described as being about one inch by one inch.

Mr. Conroy’s father, Robert Conroy, said in an interview last week that he did not know that his son had the swastika tattoo on his leg, and that if he had known, he would have taken his son somewhere to have it removed. He said his son did not believe in white supremacy and did not fully understand the symbol’s meaning and history when he got the tattoo.

“I was so mad when I found out that he had this,” Robert Conroy said. “He doesn’t wear it proudly. It was just kids being stupid.”

Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon, has made it a point during the trial to have the young men and women who testify list, one by one, Mr. Conroy’s black and Hispanic friends. Asked outside the courtroom if his client had racist tendencies, Mr. Keahon responded, “Absolutely not.” He described the tattooing as “two young kids acting like jerks.”

Under cross-examination, Ms. Sprague told Mr. Keahon that she first spoke with a detective about the case in November 2008, shortly after the stabbing, but did not mention Mr. Conroy’s white-power statement at the time. She said she first told the prosecutor about it two weeks ago.

A Hispanic man who prosecutors say was chased by the seven teenagers earlier that evening in Patchogue also testified on Tuesday. The man, Hector Sierra, 57, who was born in Colombia, said he was walking home from his job as a waiter about 11:30 p.m. when he noticed a red or brown sport utility vehicle drive slowly past him. The vehicle stopped and four people stepped out and began running toward him, Mr. Sierra testified. “They caught me from behind and started punching me,” Mr. Sierra said. He escaped serious injuries.

Mr. Sierra said he did not get a clear look at the attackers’ faces, and he did not identify Mr. Conroy as one of them.

Officer Richardsen said he did not feel any weapons on Mr. Conroy during the first pat-down. Mr. Conroy wore blue jeans and a black sweatshirt with the word “Raiders” on it. Once all seven suspects were handcuffed and about to be taken to the precinct, Officer Richardsen said he started a second pat-down and asked Mr. Conroy if he had any weapons on him.

Mr. Conroy motioned to him that he wanted to speak with him away from the six others lined up against a wall on the sidewalk.

“He said, ‘I have a blade on me,’ ” Officer Richardsen told the prosecutor, Megan O’Donnell. “He told me to lift up his sweatshirt.” He did so, he said, and saw a pocketknife in the waistband of Mr. Conroy’s underwear.

The delay in getting Mr. Lucero to the hospital is playing a role in Mr. Conroy’s defense. A forensic pathologist who previously examined Mr. Lucero’s autopsy report at the request of The New York Times described the single stab wound as a survivable injury if promptly treated.

But under cross-examination, he told Mr. Keahon that he did not hear Mr. Conroy say anything specific.

Under cross-examination, Mr. Everhardt said that when he testified to a grand jury in November 2008 he was asked if he was aware if Mr. Conroy had a knife, and his answer had been no.

Mr. Keahon asked Mr. Everhardt if he lied earlier to the grand jury. “Yes,” Mr. Everhardt replied.

When questioned again by Ms. O’Donnell, Mr. Everhardt described it as a mistake, not a lie.

One of the witnesses likely to be called next week is Angel Loja, a friend of Mr. Lucero’s who was with him that night and was chased by some of the teenagers.

Mr. Loja has received monthly payments from the Suffolk County district attorney’s office since November 2008 “to aid in the recovery of lost wages as a result of being a victim and witness to this crime,” according to a letter from the office. The money, which has totaled nearly $9,600, is meant to cover necessities like electricity, food and rent.

In a statement, Robert Clifford, a spokesman for the district attorney, said the payments were “compensation to a religious organization that provided money directly to the witness as needed for basic living expenses to enable Mr. Loja to remain in the jurisdiction and provide testimony at trial.”",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/nyregion/19patchogue.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Ms. O’Donnell told the jurors that Mr. Conroy expressed his feelings of white supremacy, both in the tattoos on his body and in the statements that he made to others, and that he made Hispanics targets because of their ethnicity and because he “felt these people were easy targets” who were unlikely to call the police.

That night, the group hopped into a sport utility vehicle belonging to one of the teenagers, after drinking beer with a larger group at the Medford train station, she said. Earlier that day, two of the teenagers shot a BB gun at another Latino man, Marlon Garcia.

Later that evening, the boys, unable to find potential victims in Medford, drove to Patchogue and went after Hector Sierra, who managed to escape. Prosecutors have charged some or all of the teenagers with attacking or trying to attack a total of six Hispanic men, including Mr. Lucero, Mr. Garcia and Mr. Sierra.

When they spotted Mr. Lucero walking with a friend near the train station in Patchogue, they surrounded him, she said. Some of the teens chased the friend, Angel Loja, while Mr. Lucero took off his denim jacket and started swinging his belt.

The belt struck Mr. Conroy in the head. Mr. Conroy, she said, took out his knife and thrust it into Mr. Lucero’s upper right chest. The teenagers fled, and Mr. Conroy rinsed the blood off the knife in a puddle of rainwater, shortly before police officers stopped the group and discovered the knife on Mr. Conroy, she said.

She added that Mr. Conroy admitted to the police at the time that he had stabbed Mr. Lucero. “There is one cause for the death of Marcelo Lucero, one cause, and that is the defendant,” she told the jury.

Mr. Conroy is facing second-degree murder as a hate crime, gang assault and other charges. He is the first person to stand trial for murder as a hate crime on Long Island since the state’s hate-crime law was enacted in 2000. Mr. Conroy has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Many of the seats in the front of the courtroom were filled with relatives and friends of Mr. Conroy’s, including his father, Robert Conroy, 49, whom Mr. Conroy nodded to as he was led in handcuffs to his seat. Mr. Lucero’s brother, Joselo Lucero, sat toward the back of the courtroom.

In his opening statement, Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon, said Ms. O’Donnell’s statements “are not fact. They are not proven.” Mr. Keahon did not discuss the specifics of that November evening, but focused most of his comments on reminding the jurors of a defendant’s presumption of innocence and other legal principles. He said that in November 2008, Mr. Conroy appeared in the same courthouse and told the judge that he was not guilty.

“Those were his words then, and those are his words today,” Mr. Keahon said.

One issue that will play a role in Mr. Conroy’s defense is the 39 minutes that elapsed from the time of the initial 911 call to when Mr. Lucero arrived at the hospital, which was only three miles from the scene. The 911 call of a man stabbed came in at 11:55 p.m., and Mr. Lucero arrived at the hospital at 12:34 a.m.

The trial’s first witness, Chris Schiera, an assistant chief with the volunteer Patchogue Ambulance Company, said they received the call at 12:01 a.m. Mr. Schiera said they spent 13 minutes at the scene, and then left at 12:25 a.m. to take Mr. Lucero to a nearby landing zone to be airlifted to Stony Brook University Medical Center. When Mr. Lucero began going into cardiac arrest and they began performing CPR on him at 12:26 a.m., they took him instead to Brookhaven, Mr. Schiera said.

He said they stopped on the way at 12:30 a.m. to pick up a paramedic with the Holbrook Fire Department, because the paramedic was “trained to a higher level of certification.” Mr. Schiera said that his E.M.T. certification had lapsed at the time, preventing him from giving a patient an IV.

Under cross-examination, Mr. Schiera said Mr. Lucero, at the scene, was in shock from blood loss. “There was nobody on scene who was actually qualified to administer an IV to Mr. Lucero,” he said.

Ms. O’Donnell said jurors would hear some “embarrassing details” during the trial. A toxicology report from the county medical examiner’s office showed that Mr. Lucero had cocaine, marijuana and alcohol in his system when he died. He had a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent, the legal limit that qualifies as being intoxicated while driving.

Mr. Lucero’s brother, Joselo, said in an earlier interview on Wednesday that he did not know if his brother had a drug problem. “Whatever they say my brother has done or not doesn’t give them the right to kill him,” he said.",nytimes.com,True

The prospective jurors were being asked to sit in judgment in the case involving the killing of Marcelo Lucero, a 37-year-old Ecuadorean immigrant stabbed to death in November 2008 in Patchogue, more than an hour’s drive from Manhattan.

Mr. Lucero was attacked by seven teenagers who, the police said, had made a sport out of assaulting Hispanic men, calling it “beaner hopping.” Mr. Lucero’s death prompted widespread outrage and exposed racial tensions in Patchogue, where a number of Latinos came forward after the attack to describe muggings and assaults that had them living in fear.

Now, as Jeffrey Conroy, 19, becomes the first defendant to go on trial in the case, jury selection has proven difficult, in part because of the views on Latino immigration held by some prospective jurors in Suffolk County.

Last week, after three days of jury selection, about 130 men and women were questioned by the judge, the prosecutor and Mr. Conroy’s defense lawyer here in State Supreme Court. Only five were selected; the rest were excused. On Monday, jury selection continued as another roughly 130 were brought in, and more than a dozen were excused by the end of the day.

Once the jury is seated, Mr. Conroy’s defense may be complicated by the fact that four of the seven teenagers have pleaded guilty and may testify against him. But something larger may be at play: the treatment of immigrants in Suffolk County and the allegations that have been raised that some residents there are biased against them.

At times, the jury selection had the feel of a call-in show on talk radio, as men and women sounded off on illegal immigration, hate crimes, their ethnic background and the American dream. Most of the comments made by potential jurors came in response to questions asked by Justice Doyle in a third-floor courtroom of the criminal courthouse in Riverhead, as Mr. Conroy sat motionless in a dark suit at a table next to his lawyer.

Mr. Conroy is accused of second-degree murder as a hate crime, among other charges, in Mr. Lucero’s death, as well as attempted assault as a hate crime in episodes involving other Hispanic men. He has pleaded not guilty. The other two defendants have pleaded not guilty to a hate crime and other charges and are awaiting trial.

Justice Doyle has said that some of the witnesses who will testify in the trial are illegal immigrants, and the potential witnesses he has named in court include three Hispanic men whom prosecutors say some or all of the young men also attempted to attack. Mr. Lucero, who worked at a dry cleaning store, had lived in the United States for 16 years at the time he was stabbed.

Several potential jurors were let go because they said they had strong views on illegal immigration and would be unable to be fair and impartial. Others were excused because they said they had Hispanic family members, or were Hispanic themselves, and would side with the victim and his family. And still others said they had followed the case in the news, and had already formed an opinion about Mr. Conroy’s guilt or innocence.

On Monday, a Riverhead man in his early 20s told the judge that he grew up in a racist environment in Pennsylvania and felt that he could not be fair. Another man said that a neighbor has been verbally abusing his son’s family for several years because his daughter-in-law is Puerto Rican and Peruvian. Justice Doyle asked him if this would affect his ability to be fair.

“It could,” said the man, who declined to elaborate after being excused.

Those who raised illegal immigration as a factor in their ability to serve chose their words carefully, so as not to condone the crimes for which Mr. Conroy stands accused.

One man, a school bus driver, said his Teamsters union had taken a stand on what he described as a lack of a federal immigration policy, and because some witnesses might be illegal immigrants, this would be a problem for him. Before he was released, the man said that what he has and what he has earned was gained legally, not illegally. “I’m the old-fashioned way,” he told Justice Doyle.

The majority of potential jurors, including the school bus driver, have been white men and women of all ages. Only a handful have been Hispanic, black or Asian.

The economic and social impact that Latino immigration and Hispanic day laborers have had on communities in Suffolk County has long been a polarizing issue. A report released following the death of Mr. Lucero by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors hate groups, found that an environment of racial intolerance fueled dozens of attacks on Latinos in the county in the past decade.

“It is a little bit of a glimpse into the soul of a community,” Bruce Barket, a Long Island defense lawyer and a former Nassau County prosecutor, said of the comments being made in this case so far. “These kinds of issues and these kinds of tensions are always present in the courtroom. Race is probably the most dominant unspoken factor in almost every trial.”

Advocates for immigrants and the brother of Mr. Lucero criticized those who said their feelings on illegal immigration prevented them from being impartial. “We’re not talking about any issues about immigration,” Mr. Lucero’s brother, Joselo Lucero, 35, said in an interview. “We’re talking about justice and human rights. This is totally different.”

Several more days of jury selection are expected. Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon, said he was not concerned about how long it was taking to select a jury. “It’s going to take us a couple days longer than unusual, but there’s no doubt that the result will be a fair and impartial jury to both sides,” he said.

There were times during the jury selection process when illegal immigration did not seem to be such a daunting issue. Last week, Megan O’Donnell, an assistant district attorney, asked prospective jurors sitting in the jury box if the victim’s immigration status mattered to them, and all assured her that it did not matter.

Carla Panetta, 60, a Patchogue mother of four and grandmother of six, was among a large group of prospective jurors that Justice Doyle excused at the end of the day on Thursday. Outside the courthouse, she said that illegal immigration had no bearing on the case, and that even though her 14-year-old grandson is Hispanic, she would have had no problem being objective. She criticized those prospective jurors who said they could not be fair because of their views on illegal immigration.

The seven Patchogue-Medford High School students accused of baiting, beating and dealing a fatal knife blow to Mr. Lucero are on trial, but unease among the immigrant population persists.

The foundation’s immediate purpose was to help the Ecuadorean community heal; its continuing goal is to provide educational and health classes to a balkanized immigrant contingent, maintain its cultural traditions and defend human rights. The foundation, which is no longer directly affiliated with the Lucero family, is composed of 40 Ecuadoreans who live in Patchogue (some here legally, some not) and some other sympathetic Long Islanders.

One of those sympathetic Long Islanders is Regina Casale, a Spanish teacher in Middle Island.

“When Marcelo passed, I thought back to what happened in Farmingville six years ago, when immigrants were the victims of violent crimes and nothing educational was done afterwards to teach kids how wrong that was,” said Ms. Casale. “Maybe if we’d done something then, those kids from Patchogue perhaps wouldn’t have attacked Marcelo.”

Ms. Casale hopes that the foundation, which operates on donations and members’ dues, fills that gap.

Thomas E. Perez, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said the department brought more federal hate crime cases this year than in any other year since 2001.

During the budget year that ended in September, 25 hate crime cases were filed, Mr. Perez said. By comparison, that number fell to a low of 12 in 2006, before rising to 23 in 2008. In 2001, 31 such cases were filed.

An initial trial in 2008 ended in mistrial over questions of Mr. Haq's mental competence. In a new trial this fall, prosecutors for the first time introduced tape recordings of Mr. Haq's speaking to family members after the shooting. Prosecutors said the tapes proved Mr. Haq was mentally competent at the time of the shootings. The verdict carries an automatic life sentence.

And a report published last month by the Department of Agriculture found that in 2008, “food insecurity” for American households had risen to record levels, with black children being the most likely to experience that food insecurity.

Things on the racial front are just as bad.

We are now inundated with examples of overt racism on a scale to which we are unaccustomed. Any protester with a racist poster can hijack a news cycle, while a racist image can live forever on the Internet. In fact, racially offensive images of the first couple are so prolific online that Google now runs an apologetic ad with the results of image searches of them.

And it’s not all words and images; it’s actions as well. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 2008 hate crimes data released last week, anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent from 2007, while the combined hate crimes against all other racial categories declined 11 percent. If you look at the two-year trend, which would include Obama’s ascension as a candidate, anti-black hate crimes have risen 8 percent, while those against the other racial groups have fallen 19 percent.

The racial animosity that Obama’s election has stirred up may have contributed to a rallying effect among blacks. According to a Gallup report published on Nov. 24, Obama’s approval rating among whites has dropped to 39 percent, but among blacks it remains above 90 percent.

Also, this hasn’t exactly been a good year for black men in the news. Plaxico Burress was locked up for accidentally shooting off a gun in a club. Henry Louis Gates Jr. was locked up for intentionally shooting off his mouth at his own home. And Michael Jackson died after being shot full of propofol. Chris Brown brutally beat Rihanna. Former Representative William Jefferson was convicted. And most recently, the “personal failings” of Tiger Woods portray him as an alley cat. Meanwhile, the most critically acclaimed black movie of the year, “Precious,” features a black man who rapes and twice impregnates his own daughter. Rooting for the president feels like a nice counterbalance.

However, the rallying creates a conundrum for blacks: how to air anxiety without further arming Obama’s enemies. This dilemma has rendered blacks virtually voiceless on some pressing issues at a time when their voices would have presumably held greater sway.

This means that Obama can get away with doing almost nothing to specifically address issues important to African-Americans and instead focus on the white voters he’s losing in droves. This has not gone unnoticed. In the Nov. 9 Gallup poll, the number of blacks who felt that Obama would not go far enough in promoting efforts to aid the black community jumped 60 percent from last summer to now.

The hard truth is that Obama needs white voters more than he needs black ones.

According to my analysis, even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day, Obama would still be president. To a large degree, Obama was elected by white people, some of whom were more able to accept him because he consciously portrayed himself as racially ambiguous.

In fact, commiserating with the blacks could prove politically problematic.

In a study to be published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences this month, researchers asked subjects to rate images of the president to determine which ones best represented his “true essence.” In some of the photos, his skin had been lightened. In others, it had been darkened. The result? The more people identified him with the “whiter” images, the more likely they were to have voted for him, and vice versa.

To the good, in his mind, was a vigil and memorial church service on Saturday that drew 500 people. To the less good, he said, was a Roman Catholic service on Sunday that, to his surprise, drew news cameras and political leaders including the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, whose harsh words on immigration and missteps after the attack made him a lightning rod.

“That was a circus for me, that was an ambush,” Mr. Lucero said. “I felt like they were trying to use my family for a political campaign.”

Still, you could say the most striking thing one year later is how, in this place at least, tragedy has led to some degree of hope, where politicians of all stripes seem to want to be seen as on the side of reconciliation as opposed to confrontation.

Foster Maer, a lawyer for the group LatinoJustice P.R.L.D.E.F., said that at the very least, the background noise around immigration seemed to have changed enormously.

“I would like to think those who are in the public view are more thoughtful about what they say and how they approach immigration issues and the Latino community,” he said. “There have always been some tremendous organizations serving the Latino community, doing great work for many years. And I sense, perhaps hopefully, that there’s a greater willingness to listen to them, and not attack them than there’s been in the past.”

The Rev. Dwight Lee Wolter of the Congregational Church of Patchogue, where Mr. Lucero’s funeral service was held last year and the post-vigil service was held on Saturday night, said there are competing emotions: attempts to do good and attempts to look good as Patchogue deals with its unwanted and probably undeserved notoriety.

He said that by many measures Patchogue was a more tolerant and responsive place than it had been a year ago. What’s needed, he said, is a way to hear from the unconverted, to have an honest conversation with the people who do not condone violence but have concerns about immigration issues — crowded and unsafe housing; access to health care; school overcrowding; language differences — which deserve a hearing.

That’s a conversation, with both sides in the same room, that is hard to find in our balkanized MSNBC-here, Fox News-there world.

Still, any cursory glimpse of Patchogue is a reminder that we are long past the point where it is a marginal conversation about suburban life. At Patricio Records, with its Ecuadorean soccer uniforms in the window and Nuestra Salud herbal teas inside, the “nuevo” CDs are far more likely to be by Jaly Alvarez or Lolita Echeverria than Nirvana.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/us/politics/23hate.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"WASHINGTON — The Senate voted Thursday to extend new federal protections to people who are victims of violent crime because of their sex or sexual orientation, bringing the measure close to reality after years of fierce debate.

The 68-to-29 vote sends the legislation to President Obama, who has said he supports it.

The measure, attached to an essential military-spending bill, broadens the definition of federal hate crimes to include those committed because of a victim’s gender or gender identity, or sexual orientation. It gives victims the same federal safeguards already afforded to people who are victims of violent crimes because of their race, color, religion or national origin.

“Hate crimes instill fear in those who have no connection to the victim other than a shared characteristic such as race or sexual orientation,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said afterward. “For nearly 150 years, we have responded as a nation to deter and to punish violent denials of civil rights by enacting federal laws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens.”

Mr. Leahy sponsored the hate-crimes amendment to the military bill and called its passage a worthy tribute to the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who first introduced hate-crimes legislation in the Senate more than a decade ago.

Opponents argued to no avail that the new measure was unnecessary in view of existing laws and might interfere with local law enforcement agencies. Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said he agreed that hate crimes were terrible. “That’s why they are already illegal,” Mr. DeMint said, asserting that the new law was a dangerous, even “Orwellian” step toward “thought crime.”

Ten Republicans voted for the hate-crimes measure. The only Democrat to oppose it was Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, who said he could not vote for the current bill “because it does nothing to bring our open-ended and disproportionate military commitment in Afghanistan to an end and/or to ensure that our troops are safely and expeditiously redeployed from Iraq.” The Senate action came two weeks after the House approved the measure, 281 to 146, and would give the federal government the authority to prosecute violent, antigay crimes when local authorities failed to.

The measure would also allocate $5 million a year to the Justice Department to assist local communities in investigating hate crimes, and it would allow the agency to assist in investigations and prosecutions if local agencies requested help.",nytimes.com,True

“Spanish kids, American kids — but no African kids,” said Mr. Sillah, a Gambian mechanic raising five children in Claremont. “We’re scared.”

Their fear and frustration are shared by many local West African immigrants, whose fast-growing presence in the neighborhood — and in the city over all — has been accompanied by increasing tensions with the local black American residents.

“They think they’re better than black people,” James Carroll, a retired Army specialist standing in front of a busy convenience store, said of the West African immigrants. “We’re supposed to be one community — we’re supposed to be able to get along — but they don’t give it a chance.”

Some of the tension can be attributed to cultural differences that all immigrants face, though the West Africans in Claremont, as conservative Muslims, have the added challenge of adjusting to a post-9/11 New York. But resentment and mistrust has escalated to actual violence, and, they say, left them feeling under siege.

After reports of nearly two dozen attacks on West African immigrants in the last two years, community leaders reached out to the police, who interviewed 17 Africans in the neighborhood and filed 11 criminal complaints. Two of those were deemed hate crimes, including an attack in June that left a Gambian immigrant hospitalized for eight days. They have made no arrest in either bias case, but a police mobile truck with a video camera now stands outside the mosque.

Claremont straddles the 44th and 42nd Precincts, two of the city’s most dangerous neighborhoods. This year, there have been 319 robberies in the 44th Precinct and 237 assaults in the 42nd. At the Butler Houses, part of a complex of housing projects that loom over the neighborhood, police sirens provide a background soundtrack, and residents of all colors and nationalities caution against walking around at night.

But the West Africans say the attacks on them are calculated. “It’s prejudice,” said Dembo Fofana, who said a beating in June by 10 to 15 men left him with broken ribs and internal bleeding. “It’s because we’re African, and we’re Muslim.”

Mr. Fofana, who came to this country 21 years ago, has not returned to his job at a bakery since the assault. He stays home, recovering, receiving disability checks and caring for his five children.

The African population in the Bronx has grown considerably in recent years: the census reported 12,063 sub-Saharan Africans in 1990, while the most recent census estimate was 61,487.

In the community district that includes Claremont, black Americans made up 44 percent of the population, according to 2000 census figures, with 52.9 percent of the area Hispanic. African immigrants were nearly 10 percent of the population, a number likely to be much higher in the 2010 census.

The Africans in Claremont hail mainly from poor, French-speaking countries: Guinea, Mali, Senegal. Like immigrants across New York, many are here illegally, working long hours for little pay. Many work as taxi drivers, convenience-store clerks, fast-food cashiers — jobs that keep them on the street late at night.

But some say the Muslims deliberately hold themselves apart. A 37-year-old American man who gave his name as Dre pointed to the pavement in front of the mosque where the African men, easily identifiable in their beards and skullcaps, gather each afternoon. “If you don’t give praise to Allah, don’t go there,” he said. “It’s just like Afghanistan.”

Kantara Baragi, the imam of the Al Tawba mosque, acknowledges that insularity is part of the problem. “We don’t hang around,” said Mr. Baragi, whose delicate frame nearly disappears inside his long, flowing robes. “We just go to work. We don’t have a relationship with people here. They don’t know us.”

So community leaders organized two meetings this summer with police officials, politicians, community board members and housing association leaders. The goal, Mr. Baragi said, was “to let them know us so they don’t look at us like strangers.”

Zain Abdullah, an assistant professor of religion, race and ethnicity at Temple University in Philadelphia, says it is common for African immigrants to suffer harassment when they settle in traditionally black neighborhoods in big cities, like Detroit, New York and Philadelphia.

“Many African-Americans feel that the influx of Africans coming in represents a kind of invasion,” he said. “Culturally, African-Americans have always imagined themselves as Africans, or at least of African descent, but they might have never encountered Africans from the continent. The actual encounter is shocking.”

Mr. Baragi, the imam, says he tries to accommodate his neighbors. His mosque, which blends in with the other storefronts, does not sound the call to prayer through speakers because “we don’t need to force everyone to hear what we’re doing.”

Instead, five times a day, from the sidewalk or, when it is cold, from behind the front door, a man from Al Tawba sings the call in a voice drowned out by the rumbling traffic.

Down the block at Café de C.E.D.E.A.O., a young man walked in last week wearing a Yankees hat tilted askew, an oversize military-style jacket and baggy pants.

Mr. Vera, a construction worker, collapsed in front of his home and started vomiting after the attack, the police said. During the next few days, he had trouble speaking, walking and sleeping, and complained of headaches and dizziness.

Mr. Vera’s wife, Ana Maria Gallardo, took her husband to Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center in Brooklyn, where doctors gave him headache medication and sent him home. But when Mr. Vera’s condition did not improve, Ms. Gallardo, on the advice of a social worker, took him to the Latino Health Institute in Manhattan on Oct. 1.

A nurse there checked Mr. Vera and told him to go to Beth Israel Medical Center, also in Manhattan, where he is in stable condition, according to a hospital spokeswoman.

Ms. Gallardo did not report the attack to the police until Oct. 9.

“Usually, they are afraid to contact the police officers,” said Joel Magallán, executive director of the Asociación Tepeyac, a Latino advocacy group. “I know that police officers should not ask if they have documents or not, but I don’t think most immigrants who are undocumented here know that.”

In a bias attack in Bushwick in 2008, an Ecuadorean immigrant, Jose Sucuzhañay, was fatally beaten, and two men have been charged in his killing.

The Mexican Consulate in New York denounced the attack on Mr. Vera.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/us/13milk.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"LOS ANGELES — In a surprise reversal of his veto of the same bill last year, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill late Sunday to set aside a day of recognition for Harvey Milk, the gay San Francisco politician who was assassinated in 1978.

The new law designates Mr. Milk’s birthday, May 22, as a day of “special significance” and encourages schools to observe days of recognition and “conduct suitable commemorative exercises.” The bill was a target of strong opposition among some conservative groups, especially those connected to the successful efforts to end same-sex marriage in California.

The same bill was introduced last year by State Senator Mark Leno, a Democrat who represents part of San Francisco and other sections of the Bay Area. The governor rejected it then, arguing that Mr. Milk, a gay rights advocate who was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 and was killed the following year, ought to be commemorated locally.

But Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, was apparently convinced by the argument, made by Mr. Leno, that an Oscar-winning film examining Mr. Milk’s life released last year and the governor’s induction of Mr. Milk into the California Hall of Fame was persuasive evidence for a change of heart.",nytimes.com,True

Republicans criticized the legislation, saying violent attacks were already illegal regardless of motive. They said the measure was an effort to create a class of “thought crimes” whose prosecution would require ascribing motivation to the attacker.

Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, called the legislation radical social policy.

“The idea that we’re going to pass a law that’s going to add further charges to someone based on what they may have been thinking, I think is wrong,” Mr. Boehner said.

Even some Republican members of the usually collegial House Armed Services Committee who helped write the broader legislation, which authorizes military pay, weapons programs and other necessities for the armed forces, opposed the bill in the end, solely because of the hate crimes provision.

“We believe this is a poison pill, poisonous enough that we refuse to be blackmailed into voting for a piece of social agenda that has no place in this bill,” said Representative Todd Akin of Missouri, a senior Republican member of the committee.

On the final vote, 237 Democrats were joined by 44 Republicans in support of the bill; 131 Republicans and 15 Democrats opposed it. The Democratic opponents were a mix of conservatives who were against the hate crimes provision and liberals opposed to Pentagon provisions.

The military bill has yet to be approved by the Senate. But the hate crimes provision has solid support there, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the overall bill outweighed his own objections to including the hate crimes measure.

Mr. Obama supports the hate crimes provision, though the White House has raised objections to elements of the bill related to military acquisitions. If signed into law, the hate crimes legislation would reflect the ability of Democrats to enact difficult measures with their increased majorities in Congress and a Democrat in the White House.

“Elections have consequences,” Mr. McCain said.

Similar hate crime provisions have passed the House and the Senate in previous years but have never been able to clear their final hurdles. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that it was fitting that Congress was acting now, since next Monday is the 11th anniversary of Matthew Shepard’s killing. The hate crimes part of the bill is named for Mr. Shepard and James Byrd Jr., a black man killed in a race-based attack in Texas the same year.

The hate crimes legislation would give the federal government authority to prosecute violent crimes of antigay bias when local authorities failed to act. It would also allocate $5 million a year to the Justice Department to provide assistance to local communities in investigating hate crimes, a process that can sometimes strain police resources. And it would allow the department to assist in the inquiry and local prosecution if requested.

Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation recorded reports of more than 77,000 hate crimes from 1998 through 2007 and that crimes based on sexual orientation were on an upward trend.

“The hate crimes act will hopefully deter people from being targeted for violent attacks because of the color of their skin or their religion, their disability, their gender or their sexual orientation, regardless of where the crime takes place,” he said.

But Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the No. 3 House Republican, said the measure could inhibit freedom of speech and deter religious leaders from discussing their views on homosexuality for fear that those publicly expressed views might be linked to later assaults.

“It is just simply wrong,” Mr. Pence said, “to use a bill designed to support our troops to reverse the very freedoms for which they fight.”

Democrats, however, noted that the bill would specifically bar prosecution based on an individual’s expression of “racial, religious, political or other beliefs.” It also states that nothing in the measure should be “construed to diminish any rights under the First Amendment to the Constitution.”",nytimes.com,True

While Austin and Ben were on the patio, a 14-year-old named Nick arrived with his mom. Nick came out to her when he was 12 but had yet to go on a date or even kiss a boy, which prompted his younger sister to opine that maybe he wasn’t actually gay. “She said, ‘Maybe you’re bisexual,’ ” Nick told me. “But I don’t have to have sex with a girl to know I’m not interested.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Ninety minutes after we arrived, Openarms was packed with about 130 teenagers who had come from all corners of the state. Some danced to the Lady Gaga song “Poker Face,” others battled one another in pool or foosball and a handful of young couples held hands on the outdoor patio. In one corner, a short, perky eighth-grade girl kissed her ninth-grade girlfriend of one year. I asked them where they met. “In church,” they told me. Not far from them, a 14-year-old named Misti — who came out to classmates at her middle school when she was 12 and weathered anti-gay harassment and bullying, including having food thrown at her in the cafeteria — sat on a wooden bench and cuddled with a new girlfriend.

Austin had practically forgotten about his boyfriend. Instead, he was confessing to me — mostly by text message, though we were standing next to each other — his crush on Laddie, a 16-year-old who had just moved to Tulsa from a small town in Texas. Like Austin, Laddie was attending the dance for the first time, but he came off as much more comfortable in his skin and had a handful of admirers on the patio. Laddie told them that he came out in eighth grade and that the announcement sent shock waves through his Texas school.

“I definitely lost some friends,” he said, “but no one really made fun of me or called me names, probably because I was one of the most popular kids when I came out. I don’t think I would have come out if I wasn’t popular.”

“When I first realized I was gay,” Austin interjected, “I just assumed I would hide it and be miserable for the rest of my life. But then I said, ‘O.K., wait, I don’t want to hide this and be miserable my whole life.’ ”

I asked him how old he was when he made that decision.

“Eleven,” he said.

As the dance wound down and the boys waited for their rides home, I joined Tim Gillean, one of Openarms’s founders, in the D.J. booth, where he was preparing to play the Rihanna song “Disturbia.” An affable 52-year-old with wire-rimmed glasses and salt-and-pepper hair, he founded Openarms in 2002 with his longtime partner, Ken Draper. In addition to the weekly dances, the couple lead discussion groups every Thursday — about self-esteem, healthy relationships and H.I.V./AIDS.

When I asked Gillean if he ever expected kids as young as Nick and Austin to show up at Openarms, he chuckled and shook his head. Like many adult gay men who came out in college or later, Gillean couldn’t imagine openly gay middle-school students. “But here they are,” he said, looking out over the crowd. “More and more of them every week.”

I heard similar accounts from those who work with gay youth all across the country. Though most adolescents who come out do so in high school, sex researchers and counselors say that middle-school students are increasingly coming out to friends or family or to an adult in school. Just how they’re faring in a world that wasn’t expecting them — and that isn’t so sure a 12-year-old can know if he’s gay — is a complicated question that defies simple geographical explanations. Though gay kids in the South and in rural areas tend to have a harder time than those on the coasts, I met gay youth who were doing well in socially conservative areas like Tulsa and others in progressive cities who were afraid to come out.

What is clear is that for many gay youth, middle school is more survival than learning — one parent of a gay teenager I spent time with likened her child’s middle school to a “war zone.” In a 2007 survey of 626 gay, bisexual and transgender middle-schoolers from across the country by the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (Glsen), 81 percent reported being regularly harassed on campus because of their sexual orientation. Another 39 percent reported physical assaults. Of the students who told teachers or administrators about the bullying, only 29 percent said it resulted in effective intervention.

A middle-school counselor in Maine summed up the view of many educators I spoke to when she conceded that her school was “totally unprepared” for openly gay students. “We always knew middle school was a time when kids struggle with their identity,” she told me, “but it was easy to let anti-gay language slide because it’s so imbedded in middle-school culture and because we didn’t have students who were out to us or their classmates. Now we do, so we’re playing catch up to try to keep them safe.”

As a response to anti-gay bullying and harassment, at least 120 middle schools across the country have formed gay-straight alliance (G.S.A.) groups, where gay and lesbian students — and their straight peers — meet to brainstorm strategies for making their campus safer. Other schools are letting students be part of the national Day of Silence each April (participants take a vow of silence for a day to symbolize the silencing effect of anti-gay harassment), which last year was held in memory of Lawrence King, a 15-year-old gay junior-high student in Oxnard, Calif., who was shot and killed at school by a 14-year-old classmate.

Both G.S.A.’s and the Day of Silence have been controversial in places, as some parents and faculty members object to what they see as the promotion of homosexuality in public schools and the “premature sexualization of the students,” as a lawyer for a school in central Florida that was fighting the creation of a G.S.A. put it. But there is a growing consensus among parents and middle-school educators that something needs to be done to curb anti-gay bullying, which a 2008 study at an all-male school by researchers at the University of Nebraska and Harvard Medical School found to be the most psychologically harmful type of bullying.

“I certainly don’t believe school districts should force a sexual agenda on the community,” says Finn Laursen, the executive director of the Christian Educators Association International, “but we can’t just put our heads in the sand and ignore the kind of harassment that’s going on.”

The challenging school experience of so many gay and lesbian students — and the suicides last spring of a sixth grader in Massachusetts and a fifth grader in Georgia, both of whom were relentlessly bullied at school for appearing gay — reinforces the longtime narrative of gay youth in crisis. Studies in the ’80s and ’90s found gay teenagers to be at a significantly higher risk for depression, substance abuse and suicide than their heterosexual peers.

When I went to work in 1998 for XY, a national magazine for young gay men, we received dozens of letters each week from teenagers in the depths of despair. Some had been thrown out by their families; others lived at home but were reminded often that they were intrinsically flawed. My arrival at XY (at 23, I was only three years out of the closet myself) coincided with the founding of the Trevor Project, which runs a national 24-hour crisis and suicide hot line for gay and questioning youth, and with the first large wave of G.S.A.’s in high schools. (They are now in more than 4,000 high schools, according to Glsen.)

But by the time I stopped writing for the magazine nearly three years later, the content of the letters we received was beginning to change. A new kind of gay adolescent was appearing on the page — proud, resilient, sometimes even happy. We profiled many of them in the magazine, including a seventh grader in suburban Philadelphia who was out to his classmates and a high-school varsity-football player from Massachusetts who came out to his teammates and was shocked to find unconditional support.

That’s not to say that gay teenagers didn’t still suffer harassment at school or rejection at home, but many seemed less burdened with shame and self-loathing than their older gay peers. What had changed? Not only were there increasingly accurate and positive portrayals of gays and lesbians in popular culture, but most teenagers were by then regular Internet users. Going online broke through the isolation that had been a hallmark of being young and gay, and it allowed gay teenagers to find information to refute what their families or churches sometimes still told them — namely, that they would never find happiness and love.

Today, nearly a decade after my time at XY, young people with same-sex attractions are increasingly coming out and living lives that would be “nearly incomprehensible to earlier generations of gay youth,” Ritch Savin-Williams writes in his book “The New Gay Teenager.” A professor of developmental psychology at Cornell University, Savin-Williams told me recently that being young and gay is no longer an automatic prescription for a traumatic childhood.

In particular, openly gay youth who are perceived as conforming to adolescent gender norms are often fully integrated into their peer and school social circles. Girls who come out as bisexual but are still considered “feminine” are often immune from harassment, as are some gay boys, like Laddie, who come out but are still considered “masculine.” “Bisexual girls have it the easiest,” Austin told me in Oklahoma. “Most of the straight guys at school think that’s hot, so that can make the girl even more popular.”

Still, the younger they are when they come out, the more that youth with same-sex attractions face an obstacle that would be unimaginable to their straight peers. When a 12-year-old boy matter-of-factly tells his parents — or a school counselor — that he likes girls, their reaction tends not to be one of disbelief, dismissal or rejection. “No one says to them: ‘Are you sure? You’re too young to know if you like girls. It’s probably just a phase,’ ” says Eileen Ross, the director of the Outlet Program, a support service for gay youth in Mountain View, Calif. “But that’s what we say too often to gay youth. We deny them their feelings and truth in a way we would never do with a heterosexual young person.”

I was guilty of my share of that, too, the first time I met Kera — then a 12-year-old seventh grader — and her 13-year-old best friend, Justin, last spring in a city in New England. Kera had small, delicate features. Justin had freckles and braces. They seemed like kids. Yet there they were at a bookstore coffee shop after school, talking nonchalantly — when they weren’t giggling uncontrollably about one of their many inside jokes, that is — about their sexual identities. Kera said she was bisexual. Justin said he was gay. The effect was initially surreal to me, and before long I heard myself blurt out, “But you’re so young!”

My reaction surprised me. After all, I’d known on some level that I was gay when I was their age. If I were growing up today, it’s possible that I would feel emboldened enough to confide in my parents, or at least a close friend, that I was gay. I’d also spent the morning of my visit reading a handful of studies about when gay and lesbian youth first report an awareness of same-sex attraction. Though most didn’t self-identify as gay or lesbian until they were 14, 15 or 16, the mean age at which they first became aware of that attraction was 10. Boys tended to be aware about a year earlier than girls. (Of course, not all kids with same-sex attractions go on to self-identify as gay.)

Those findings are consistent with what many adult gay men have been reporting for years: they may not have come out until adulthood, but they knew they were attracted to the same sex as early as elementary or middle school. Kera and Justin knew that, too, but they’re among the first generation of young gay adolescents to take on an identity that many parents and educators associate with adult lifestyle choices.

Kera says she was 10 when she realized she was interested in both sexes. “It was confusing for a while, because for some reason I thought that you had to be straight or gay, and that you couldn’t be both,” she told me at the coffee shop. “So I thought about it a lot, like I do about everything, and I went online and looked up bisexuality to read more about it. I realized that was me.”

She told her mom soon after (more on that later) and then came out to her close friends at school, including Justin, who she had suspected was gay. Last year, the entire school found out when she briefly dated a female classmate. “We didn’t think we had anything to be ashamed of, so we didn’t want to go around hiding,” she told me. “It was a whole big drama at school. Some guys made fun of us, others hit on us. Most middle-school guys are total, complete morons.”

Though he wishes he could be as “brave” as Kera, Justin is out to only a few friends at school. “I lie when people ask me if I’m gay,” he told me. “Sometimes they leave me alone after that, but other times they still call me names.”

Kera doesn’t back down when someone harasses her or one of her gay friends. “I don’t want to be a bully back, but if I get mad, I will say mean things back,” she told me, adding that she has gotten into two fights at school.

Middle school was even worse last year for another boy named Austin, who lives in a small town in Michigan. A tall, heavyset 15-year-old now in his first year of high school, Austin said his eighth-grade classmates regularly called him the “gay freak.” They groped themselves in front of him. Not a day went by when someone didn’t call him a “fag,” sometimes with teachers present. And at a football game last fall, several classmates forced him off the bleachers because it wasn’t “the queer section.”

“I would have preferred that he not come out in school, but he wanted to be honest — he wanted to be true to himself,” Austin’s mother, Nadia, told me. “So I took a job as the lunch lady at school because I felt like I needed to be his bodyguard. It seems like I spent the entire year in the principal’s office trying to get them to protect my son. But they would say things like, ‘Well, what did he do to provoke them?’ We live in a very conservative area with very vocal parents, and I believe the school didn’t want to be seen as going out of their way at all to protect a gay student.”

The school’s principal would not comment specifically about Austin, but he insisted that the school “does not tolerate harassment and bullying of any kind.” He did concede that teachers don’t react to anti-gay language as consistently as he would like, which is something I also heard from a counselor at Kera’s school. “We have veteran teachers who have been teaching for 25 years, and some just see the language as so imbedded in the language of middle-schoolers that it’s essentially unchangeable,” she said. “Others are afraid to address the language because they feel like it would mean talking about sexuality, which they aren’t comfortable doing in a middle school setting.”

Jennifer Mathieu Blessington, who teaches at Johnston Middle School in Houston, said she has been forced to address the issue in her class. “Many boys at that age are so unsure of themselves and are incredibly worried about being perceived as gay, so they call everything and everyone else gay,” she told me. She relayed to me a recent incident when a boy in her class held up a book with a pink cover and said he wouldn’t want to read it because it “looks gay.” “Everyone in the class started laughing like it was the funniest thing they’d ever heard,” Blessington continued, “but I said: ‘We don’t use the word “gay” in a negative way in this classroom. Gay people are human beings, and that’s the way we talk about them in here. Is that understood?’ ”

By far the most common usage of the word “gay” in middle schools is in the expression “that’s so gay,” a popular adolescent phrase that means that something is dumb or lame. The phrase has become so ubiquitous in the culture of the average middle school that even friends of gay students sometimes use it. Still, the expression is offensive to many, and last year Glsen and the Ad Council embarked on a media campaign to combat it. (Glsen would have preferred to go after more incendiary language, “but broadcasters would be very reluctant to let us say the word ‘faggot’ on television,” Eliza Byard, Glsen’s executive director, told me.)

Though the commercials (featuring the celebrities Hilary Duff and Wanda Sykes) are aimed at teenagers, many of those who work with gay youth say that teachers also need to get the message. “Teachers would never let students say, ‘That’s so black,’ ” says Eileen Ross from the Outlet Program in Mountain View, “but I’ve had teachers look at me like I’m crazy when I suggest that they should say something to a student who says ‘that’s so gay.’ They’ll say, ‘If I have to stop what I’m doing every time a student says that, I won’t have any time to teach!’ ”

A few years ago, when I first heard from educators that young adolescents were coming out of the closet, I visited a middle school in Northern California where three eighth graders (a gay boy named Justin and two heterosexual girls, Alison and Amelia) took me on a tour of the school. They wanted to show me how many students were gay, bisexual or “confused,” but they wanted to do it discreetly — or as discreetly as middle-schoolers can.

All three were members of the school’s G.S.A. “Even though this is a liberal area,” Alison explained, “it’s still hard to be gay at this school. Most people won’t even come to G.S.A. meetings because they don’t want people other than their close friends to know they’re gay or lesbians, even though straight people also come to meetings. I get called a lesbian all the time even though I’m not.” She continued, “People are totally paranoid.” She suggested that they “come up with some code words on the down low so we can tell you what’s up without anyone knowing what we’re saying!” (They settled on “paw” for gay and “woof” for bisexual.)

As we walked past the gym, a group of boys came rushing out. Justin pointed to a short, muscular eighth grader in a baseball cap. “Paw!” he said.

Alison looked surprised. “Isn’t he a woof?”

“No, he just thinks he’s a woof,” Justin said.

Amelia looked confused. “What does woof mean again?”

A minute later, they fixed their gaze on a boy sitting against a wall listening to his iPod. “Paw,” Alison told me. “I mean woof!”

“Yeah, he’ll make out with anyone,” Justin confirmed. “Totally bisexual.”

“No, he’s not!” Amelia said, apparently distraught by the news.

“Oh, stop getting all mad just ’cause you like him,” Alison told her. “Everyone knows he’s a woof.”

After pointing out a handful of girls who are “definitely woofs,” Alison turned to me and recalled a recent “lesbian moment” of hers. “I totally had the hots for this girl in ‘Jesus Christ Superstar,’ ” she said with a giggle. “I was, like, ‘Whoa, I’m really attracted to you right now!’ ”

“Jesus was hot in that, too,” Justin offered.

Midway through our tour we were joined by Sayre, a handsome and soft-spoken 12-year-old. Sayre was one of the few students at the school who was out to everyone, which had earned him the respect of the G.S.A.’s dozen or so members. “I really admire him,” Justin told me as we walked. “I’ve only come out to my close friends, but Sayre doesn’t care what people think.”

I asked Sayre if he was interested in any boys at the school. “I like this one guy over there,” he said, pointing toward classmates playing soccer on a grass field, “but I think he’s straight, so that’s probably not going to happen.” A few minutes later, Sayre added that he was in no rush to start dating. “It’s not like I have a lot of options anyway,” he said, echoing what I would go on to hear from many gay middle-schoolers. “I like guys who are nice and caring and don’t act like jerks to everyone. But this is middle school, where guys think it’s funny to pick their nose and fart really loud and laugh.”

As we came to the end of our tour, we approached a handful of boys sitting in a circle on the pavement eating lunch. “Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof!” Justin said, barely able to contain himself. “They’re all woofs.” One boy heard him and turned to us. “What’s a woof?” he asked us.

“Never mind,” Justin said.

“I don’t think he’s really a woof,” Alison told me, referring to a boy in the circle. “I think he’s straight but just confused.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“He’s not confused,” Justin assured her. “He’s confused,” he said, referring to another boy in the circle. “He doesn’t know what he is. He changes his mind a lot.”

I was certainly confused trying to keep track of it all, but Alison told me not to worry. “We can’t even keep up with who’s gay or bi and who’s into who, and we go to school here!” she said.

All of this fluidity, confusion and experimentation can be understandably disorienting for parents and educators. Is an eighth grader who says he’s gay just experimenting? Could he change his mind in a week, as 13-year-olds routinely do with other identities — skater, prep, goth, jock — they try on for a while and then shed for another? And if sexuality is so fluid, should he really box himself in with a gay identity? Many parents told me they especially struggled with that last question.

Nadia, the mother of Austin in Michigan, told me that she and her husband “blew up” at him when he came out to them. “I really lost it, and my husband took it even harder than I did,” she said. “We just couldn’t wrap our heads around the idea that Austin would know what he was at 13, and that he would want to tell other people.”

A year earlier they asked Austin if he was gay after they discovered his call to a gay chat line. He promised them that he was straight, and he promised himself that he would cover his tracks better. It’s not uncommon for gay youth to have their same-sex attraction discovered thanks to a rogue number on a phone bill or, more often these days, a poorly concealed Internet search history. “We see a lot of kids get outed by porn on the computer,” Tim Gillean told me in Tulsa. “I knew one kid who told his mom: ‘I don’t know how that got there. Maybe it was dad!’ ”

Austin eventually ended up telling his parents he was bisexual, which he knew was a lie (he wasn’t attracted to girls) but which he hoped would lessen the blow. But the plan backfired. “My mom said something like: ‘What does that mean, you’re bisexual? Do you just wake up in the morning and willy-nilly decide what you’re going to be that day? Straight yesterday, bi today, gay tomorrow?’ ” Austin recalled. “For the next two months my parents tried to convince me that I couldn’t know what I was. But I knew I was different in second grade — I just didn’t really put a name to it until I was 11. My parents said, ‘How do you know what your sexuality is if you haven’t had any sexual experiences?’ I was like, ‘Should I go and have one and then report back?’ ”

While Austin’s mother correctly assumed that Austin wasn’t yet sexually active, other parents heard the words “gay” or “bisexual” and immediately thought “sex.” In reality, many of their kids hadn’t had any yet. Some (including Kera’s friend Justin) hadn’t even kissed anyone. Those who had been sexual in some form often reported that it was with a heterosexual friend who they presumed was just experimenting.

Though many of the parents I spoke to needed a period of adjustment before accepting their children’s announcement that they were gay or bisexual, others offered immediate and unequivocal support. “The biggest difference I’ve seen in the last 10 years isn’t with gay kids — it’s with their families,” says Dan Woog, an openly gay varsity boys’ soccer coach at Staples High School in Westport, Conn., who helped found a gay-straight alliance at his school in 1993. “Many parents just don’t assume anymore that their kids will have a sad, difficult life just because they’re gay.”

That was certainly the case for Kera’s mother, who told me she hardly batted an eye when Kera came out to her. I visited them last spring in their small two-story house on a quiet street in a middle-class neighborhood. We sat at the kitchen table. Kera’s mother, who had just finished her shift as a nurse, hadn’t had time to change out of her blue scrubs.

Kera handed me a poem she wrote for her mom a year earlier. “It’s not one of my best,” she insisted, covering her ears in embarrassment after she agreed that I could read a portion of it into my tape recorder.

I like girls. I know it’s true

I like girls, I really do

Not just boys, but girls as well

I’m bisexual as you can tell

“My first reaction to the poem, which she slipped under my bedroom door before going to hide in her room, was that she seemed really worked up about this,” her mother recalled. “But I knew I was interested in boys when I was her age, so it didn’t strike me as unusual that Kera might know she’s interested in boys and girls, put two and two together and call herself bisexual. Kids just know what those words mean a lot earlier than when I was growing up.”

On the national Day of Silence last April, I visited Daniel Webster Middle School in Los Angeles, one of 21 middle schools in California with a G.S.A. California is one of only 12 states that have passed laws to protect students from bullying and harassment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. (In May, Representative Linda Sanchez of California introduced the Safe Schools Improvement Act, a federal anti-bullying bill that would require schools to implement comprehensive anti-bullying policies that include protections for gay students.)

I arrived at Daniel Webster, a school of some 850 students, most of them Hispanic or African-American, at lunchtime. About 50 kids milled around two large wooden tables at the center of the school’s leafy courtyard. Many of them wore pink T-shirts, and some filled out cards that would later be strung together and displayed: “You Are What You Are — Embrace It,” “Never Put Someone Down, and Never Let Someone Put You Down.” Others communicated using hand gestures or by writing notes to one another. But most had given up trying to be mute. “Good luck getting middle-schoolers not to talk,” the school’s counselor and G.S.A. co-adviser at the time, Ruben Valerio, told me with a smile.

One of the loudest students at the tables was Johnny (a nickname), a tall, handsome seventh grader. A leader of the G.S.A., he had only managed to stay quiet for about 30 seconds that morning. “It’s just really exciting to be at a school where it’s O.K. to be gay,” he told me as he bear-hugged his friend, an outgoing seventh grader known to her friends as Lala, who’d come out earlier that year as bisexual. At his previous school, Johnny didn’t feel safe and had little support when he came out to his mother. “She would go back and forth between saying things like: ‘I love you. I just don’t understand why you would choose this lifestyle at this age,’ to ‘It’s disgusting what you’re doing. Are you a faggot now?’ No one would ever use that word here.”

Johnny estimated that there were about 35 girls and 10 boys at Daniel Webster who were out as bisexual, lesbian or gay. (The vast majority of those girls identified as bisexual.) He introduced me to a handful of them, including two members of the G.S.A.: Tina (also a nickname), a seventh grader who considered herself bisexual and was dating a boy at another school; and a popular eighth-grade girl who used to date Tina.

They were joined at the tables by dozens of their straight friends and a handful of teachers. One teacher, Richard Mandl, approached me and asked what I thought of the school. I told him that I’d never seen so many happy gay kids in one place. “It’s a little disorienting,” I told him. “I feel like I’m in a parallel gay universe.”

He laughed. “Yeah, it’s pretty unusual what’s happened here,” he said. “It definitely wasn’t always this way.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

When Mandl began teaching at the school in 2002, he said that there weren’t any openly gay students — and that it was common to hear anti-gay language. “Kids would run by you and be screaming at another kid: ‘You fag! You’re so gay!’ ” he said. “It wasn’t until a few years ago when the faculty sort of came together and said: ‘You know what? We need to stop this.’ ”

That became a lot easier two years ago when one of the school’s most popular boys came out to his classmates. Because he was so well liked, and because so many of his friends rallied around him, “it became cooler at Daniel Webster to be accepting and open-minded,” Mandl said.

The principal, Kendra Wallace, told me that she didn’t hesitate when the school’s science teacher approached her (on behalf of the boy and several of his friends) about starting a G.S.A. “I had some staff who were livid at first, because they thought it would be about sex, or us endorsing a lifestyle,” she said. “But the G.S.A. isn’t about that, and they’ve come around. This is a club that promotes safety, and it gives kids a voice. And the most amazing thing has happened since the G.S.A. started. Bullying of all kinds is way down. The G.S.A. created this pervasive anti-bullying culture on campus that affects everyone.”

Not all principals have reacted as enthusiastically to students or teachers hoping to start a G.S.A. (Teachers often wait for students to make the request, because they don’t want to be perceived as “having a political agenda,” as one school counselor told me.) At a middle school in Massachusetts, the G.S.A. adviser told me that the school’s principal initially balked when students asked to observe the Day of Silence and start a G.S.A. “She argued that it wasn’t age-appropriate, and she worried about having to deal with negative editorials in the local paper,” the adviser said. But because the school had other extracurricular clubs, “the principal was made aware that blocking a G.S.A. from forming is against the law.”

Indeed, courts — citing the Equal Access Act, which requires public schools to provide equal access to extracurricular clubs — have consistently ruled against schools that try to block G.S.A.’s from starting. (The 1984 law was the brainchild of Christian groups fighting to allow students to form religious clubs in schools.)

When Yulee High School in northeast Florida was forced by a federal judge last spring to let a G.S.A. meet on campus, the school asked students to change the name of their proposed club to something other than Gay Straight Alliance. The students refused, and a court backed them up in August. Administrators at Austin’s middle school in Michigan used the same tactic when he tried to start a G.S.A. there, he said. “They told me I needed to change the name to something ‘less controversial,’ ” Austin recalled. “I didn’t feel like fighting them, so I just called it the Peace Alliance.”

And because there were so few openly gay students at Austin’s middle school last year, all but 2 of the 15 or so students who attended each meeting were straight. At G.S.A. meetings at Daniel Webster, gay and straight members spend two periods a week reading and discussing news stories about gay issues, organizing events like the Day of Silence and talking about navigating the outside world — which isn’t always as supportive as their campus. Lala, for example, said the backing of the G.S.A. was critical when she came out to her family.

“They’re a lot better now, but the first thing one of my relatives did when I told them I was bisexual was hit me on the head with a Bible,” she told me. “So while I was dealing with that insanity at home, I at least had a safe place at school to talk about what was happening.”

Later that day, as I sat in a conference room with a handful of the G.S.A members from Daniel Webster, they spent a lot of time talking about dating. Asking 13- or 14-year-olds if they think they’re old enough to date is a little like asking them if they’re old enough to stay up past 11, so I didn’t even bother. I was more interested in learning how their parents reacted to the news that they not only had gay kids — but also that those kids had same-sex boyfriends or girlfriends.

Tina surprised me when she said her father actually prefers that she date girls. “His biggest fear has always been that I’ll get pregnant before I’m 18,” she told us, “so my dad’s really supportive of the girl thing.”

Johnny said his mom has made it very clear that he’s not allowed to bring a boyfriend over to the house. “She’s like, ‘O.K., I accept you, but you better not bring any of those people around,’ ” he told me.

That’s one of about 50 “rejecting behaviors” identified by Caitlin Ryan of San Francisco State University, who has spent the last eight years studying the link between family acceptance or rejection of gay children and their mental health in early adulthood. (Ryan found that teenagers in “rejecting families” were significantly more likely to have attempted suicide, used drugs and engaged in unprotected sex than those who were raised in accepting families.)

Of course, many parents of middle-schoolers don’t want their child dating yet, no matter their sexual orientation. But several parents I spoke to conceded that it wasn’t always easy to fashion the same rules for their gay and straight kids. Their instinct was to tell their gay children to wait longer before they could date. Austin from Michigan said he could see the struggle playing out in his parents. “When I came out, they said I couldn’t date anyone until I was 18,” he said. “Then I think they realized that was ridiculous, so they changed it to 16.”

In a rural area outside of Tulsa a few years ago, I visited a mother and her 14-year-old gay son, Ely, who were struggling to fashion the rules of when, and in what context, he could date. I listened as Ely tried to persuade his mother to let his latest crush spend time in his room (“With the door shut,” he clarified):

Ely: So, can we hang out in my room?

Mother: I don’t trust you two alone in there. Period.

Ely: What about if there are no body parts touching?

Mother: You don’t have that kind of self-control.

Ely: Yes, I do!

Mother: No you don’t. How old is he again?

Ely: 15.

Mother: And he has a shaved head and piercings everywhere. Is this who you really want to date?

Ely: All kinds of people have shaved heads.

Mother: I don’t think you’re ready to have a relationship right now.

Ely: Ugh.

Mother: I know, I know, you can’t wait to move away from me. You have the most unfair mother in the world!

As I listened to them bicker, I couldn’t help remembering what Ritch Savin-Williams, the professor of developmental psychology at Cornell, told me the first time we spoke: “This is the first generation of gay kids who have the great joy of being able to argue with their parents about dating, just like their straight peers do.”

Though dating and sexual activity were a reality for some of the middle-schoolers I spent time with, others were more concerned with simply making gay friends their age. Those who attended a school with other openly gay students or who lived near a gay youth group (Openarms in Tulsa, for example) were the lucky ones. But many, like Austin in Michigan, had never met another openly gay boy.

“He has his close girl friends, but he doesn’t have any gay friends,” his mother told me. To meet other gay people, he has gone with his father to nearby meetings of Pflag (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), where gay kids often accompany their parents. And in June, she agreed to let him attend the gay-pride parade two hours away in Chicago.

“I told Austin he could go if either me or his dad went with him,” she recalled. “So he chose his dad, probably because he knew it would be the thing his dad would want to do least in the world. But off they went, and I give my husband credit, because he will do anything for his son. He doesn’t totally understand why Austin is gay, or how he can know for sure at his age, but he’s trying to be there for him. And he’s rarely seen Austin happier than at the parade. Austin warned his dad, ‘You can’t get mad at me when I scream at cute guys in Speedos!’ And boy, did Austin scream. He was in gay teenage heaven.”",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/world/africa/23safrica.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Ms. Simelane, who was killed in April 2008, was one of 18,148 murder victims in the 12 months that ended in March. Tuesday was also the day the South African Police Service released its annual crime report. The data showed 339 fewer homicides than in the previous 12-month period, an improvement that still left this country of 49 million people with one of the world’s highest murder rates. At the same time, the number of reported sex crimes jumped to 70,514, up nearly 7,000. Burglaries of homes and businesses also increased sharply.

South Africans are obsessed with the violent crime in their midst, and earlier this month the new police minister, Nathi Mthethwa, tried to reassure them. “We are tired of waving nice documents like the Constitution” at criminals, he said, vowing instead to “meet the thugs head-on, and if it means we kill when we shoot them, so be it.”

The problem with such tough talk, gay and lesbian groups say, is that it often excludes crimes directed at them. They claim they are special targets of violence, and snickering, abusive police officers do little to protect them or pursue their complaints.

The Simelane case has been central to a campaign to bring attention to attacks against lesbians and gay men. But sexual orientation was never established as a motive at the trial. Judge Mokgoathleng was uncomfortable with the term lesbian itself. “Is there another word that you can use instead of that one?” he asked the prosecutor.

Ms. Simelane grew up in Kwa Thema, a township of small, modest homes southeast of Johannesburg. “There were three of us: Eudy, me and Zodwa,” said Pretty Makhalya, her closest friend. “Whatever we did was boyish. We were different, you could tell. We were athletes. We played with the boys but we had feelings for the girls.”

By high school, they better understood their sexuality, she said. They dressed butch, wearing pants and T-shirts, jockeys instead of panties. They dated other girls, preferring their partners “looking beautiful with makeup and everything.”

Kwa Thema was unusual among townships. Lesbians were quite open. Most boys their age were comfortable around them. “But there were also guys who’d say, ‘C’mon, we’ll teach you how to be a girl,’ ” Ms. Makhalya said. “They looked at us like we were crazy people, defying nature. Things would heat up. There’d be fights.

“And it wasn’t just some boys who hated us, we realized. Some churches were no-go areas. They wouldn’t let us in if we were wearing trousers.”

Ms. Simelane was one of the best-known people in Kwa Thema. People were wild about soccer, and she was good enough to make the national team, Banyana Banyana, competing internationally for a few years. She was a bar-hopper, not just hanging out at places like Savey’s and Hlubi’s that welcomed gay men and lesbians, but at other spots, too.

Her killers attacked her in the darkness as Ms. Simelane was walking home near an open field. Mr. Mpithi said that he did not know Ms. Simelane, and that robbery — not her identity as a lesbian — was the only motive for the attack. One of the other three men, Johannes Mahlangu, decided to rape Ms. Simelane because she was carrying no money, Mr. Mpithi said. As the sexual assault went on, Ms. Simelane recognized Mr. Mvubu. To save themselves from arrest, the men decided she had to be killed.

Mr. Mpithi, promising to testify against the others, was given a 32-year prison sentence. But when the trial began in July, he said he had become a born-again Christian and could no longer repeat his earlier lies. He then said that the other three defendants were not involved.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/nyregion/03suffolk.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"HAUPPAUGE, N.Y.  An environment of racial intolerance and ethnic hatred, fostered by anti-immigrant groups and some public officials, has helped fuel dozens of attacks on Latinos in Suffolk County during the past decade, says a report issued Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that tracks hate groups around the country.

“Latino immigrants in Suffolk County live in fear,” said the report, which the law center released at a news conference here. “Political leaders in the county have done little to discourage the hatred, and some have actively fanned the flames.”

The law center, based in Montgomery, Ala., came to prominence in the 1970s for anti-discrimination efforts and its legal battles against the Ku Klux Klan. It started looking at Suffolk County after Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant, was stabbed to death last November in Patchogue. Seven youths, who prosecutors say were driven by prejudice against Latinos, are awaiting trial in that case.

The center’s report is the product of months of investigation on Long Island, including scores of interviews with Latino immigrants and local civic leaders. While it draws heavily on news accounts and public records, center officials said it was the most comprehensive compilation of statements and events showing a pattern of hate crimes in Suffolk that were at least tacitly condoned  if not actively encouraged  by some local leaders.

The center’s investigators made “frightening” discoveries, the report said: “Although Lucero’s murder represented the apex of anti-immigration violence in Suffolk County to date, it was hardly an isolated incident.”

Many Latino immigrants in Suffolk say they have been beaten with baseball bats and other objects, attacked with BB guns and pepper spray, and been the victims of arson, the report said. Latinos, it added, are frequently run off the road while riding bicycles or pelted with objects hurled from cars.

On Aug. 15, after the center’s report had been printed, an Ecuadorean man in Patchogue was attacked by three men who used racial epithets as they kicked and punched him, the police said. The three were arrested, and two were charged with assault as a bias crime, Newsday reported.

On Aug. 20, a man in Smithtown told a mother and a daughter who wore traditional Islamic garb that he was going to “chop you into little pieces and kill you,” the police said. The man was charged with second-degree aggravated harassment, the Associated Press reported.

And on Wednesday, the police said, hate-crimes detectives were investigating a burglary Tuesday night at a Latino evangelical church in Patchogue, in which notes with anti-Hispanic comments were found on the altar.

The law center report, echoing often-repeated statements by advocates for immigrants, accused the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, of helping to create an atmosphere of anti-immigrant sentiment by taking a hard line against illegal immigration.

In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Levy said, “While we can continue to disagree about policies related to the economic and social impacts of illegal immigration, we can all agree that any violence against a fellow human being cannot and will not be tolerated.” In the past, Mr. Levy has repeatedly denied accusations that he has fomented bias.

The report pointed to a statement by Michael M. D’Andre, a county legislator from Smithtown, at a 2001 hearing on a bill to penalize contractors who hire undocumented workers. Mr. D’Andre said that if his town were “attacked” by an influx of Hispanic day laborers, “we’ll be up in arms, we’ll be out with baseball bats.” He apologized the following week for his remark.

The report also highlighted a comment by Elie Mystal, a county legislator from Amityville, who said during a hearing in 2007 that if day laborers started gathering in his neighborhood, “I would load my gun and start shooting, period.” He later apologized and said he had been joking, according to news media reports.

Mr. D’Andre and Mr. Mystal are no longer legislators.

The report said Latinos’ fears were fed by nativist groups like Sachem Quality of Life, a local organization that has disbanded.

After Mr. Lucero’s death, many immigrants in the county stepped forward to describe their attacks to the police and media. In some of the cases, the allegations were reported to the police at the time the assaults occurred, but no arrests were made, in part because language barriers made communication difficult, the authorities have said.

Law center officials said that according to immigrants they interviewed, there may have been another reason for the inaction: police indifference.

Many immigrants told center investigators that the “police did not take their reports of attacks seriously, often blaming the victim,” the report said. “They said there’s little point in going to the police, who are often not interested in their plight and instead demand to know their immigration status.”

The Suffolk County police commissioner, Richard Dormer, said in a statement, “Some of the report had concrete ideas, most of which we are already implementing, but other parts were rife with inaccuracies due to the law center’s failure to interview the Police Department, the district attorney or elected officials.”

The report urged officials to adopt measures including halting “their angry demagoguery” about immigration, promoting programs that encourage respect for diversity, and training police officers to take seriously all allegations of hate-motivated crime.

“If these measures are taken to combat an increasingly volatile situation,” the report said, “it’s likely that angry passions in Suffolk can be cooled and a rational debate on immigration and its consequences begun.”",nytimes.com,True

Most of these offenses were classified as propaganda crimes — painting swastikas on Jewish headstones or smashing the windows of restaurants run by immigrants — but politically motivated violent acts like murder, arson and assault accounted for 1,042 of the nearly 20,000 crimes recorded, a rise of 6.3 percent over 2007.

And these violent crimes turned out to be far more commonplace in parts of the former East Germany. Saxony, with roughly 5 percent of the country’s population, accounted for 12 percent of the violence classified as far right in nature, the report said.

These days Dresden’s center, once obliterated by Allied bombs, is a marvel of civility, a restored Baroque fairyland surrounded by Socialist-era and post-Socialist-era sprawl. The rebuilt Frauenkirche, the great Baroque cathedral where Bach played, again marks the skyline with its bell-shaped dome, as it did for centuries.

The ruin of the Frauenkirche became a gathering spot for protests against the East German regime during Communist times. In February, as usual on the anniversary of the Allied air raids, neo-Nazis marched through the streets. Some 7,500 of them carried banners condemning the “bombing holocaust.” They were outnumbered, Spiegel Online reported, by anti-Nazi demonstrators, but 7,500 was nonetheless twice as many neo-Nazis as showed up last year.

The other day only the benign clop-clop of horse-drawn carriages sounded across the cobblestone square outside the cathedral, the carriages bouncing camera-toting tourists past high-end jewelry shops and overpriced cafes. Nearby, the Zwinger palace, perhaps the most beautiful of all Baroque complexes, attracted the usual supplicants to Raphael’s Sistine Madonna, which was paired in the Gemäldegalerie with an African sculpture.

Germany is now a bastion of democracy in the heart of Europe. But the far right is on the rise across the Continent, and xenophobia is gaining in this country, not least among youth and not least singling out Muslims.

The newspaper Tagesspiegel reported that Alex W. asked Ms. Sherbini in the courtroom, “Do you have a right to be in Germany at all?” before warning her that “when the NPD comes to power, there’ll be an end to that.”

“I voted NPD,” he added.

No surprise.

The far-right National Party, a marginal but noisy troublemaker on the German political scene with a tiny official membership (some 7,000), is as strong in Saxony as it is anywhere. Recent polls have routinely shown its support in the state as nearing 10 percent of the population; it claims 8 seats out of the 124 in the state parliament in Dresden. On Tuesday the party issued a statement calling for a black politician, Zeca Schall, working on regional elections in Thuringia for the ruling Christian Democratic Union, “to head home to Angola.” Thuringia should “remain German,” the statement said. Mr. Schall, Angolan-born, has lived in Thuringia, another region in the former East, since 1988.

High-tech industries and research institutes like the one where Ms. Sherbini’s husband works, which recruit foreign experts, have lifted Dresden economically above much of the rest of the former East, and last year nearly 10 million tourists fattened the city’s coffers.

All of which gets back to the problem of reconciliation: What are the humanizing effects of culture?

Evidently, there are none.

To walk through Dresden’s museums, and past the young buskers fiddling Mozart on street corners, is to wonder whether this age-old question may have things backward. It presumes that we’re passive receivers acted on by the arts, which vouchsafe our salvation, moral and otherwise, so long as we remain in their presence. Arts promoters nowadays like to trumpet how culture helps business and tourism; how teaching painting and music in schools boosts test scores. They try to assign practical ends, dollar values and other hard numbers, never mind how dubious, to quantify what’s ultimately unquantifiable.

The lesson of Dresden, which this great city unfortunately seems doomed to repeat, is that culture is, to the contrary, impractical and fragile, helpless even. Residents of Dresden who believed, when the war was all but over, that their home had somehow been spared annihilation by its beauty were all the more traumatized when, in a matter of hours, bombs killed tens of thousands and obliterated centuries of humane and glorious architecture.

The truth is, we can stare as long as we want at that Raphael Madonna; or at Antonello da Messina’s “St. Sebastian,” now beside a Congo fetish sculpture in another room in the Gemäldegalerie; or at the shiny coffee sets, clocks and cups made of coral and mother-of-pearl and coconuts and diamonds culled from the four corners of the earth in the city’s New Green Vault, which contains the spoils of the most cultivated Saxon kings. But it won’t make sense of a senseless murder or help change the mind of a violent bigot.

What we can also do, though, is accept that while the arts won’t save us, we should save them anyway. Because the enemies of civilized society are always just outside the door.",nytimes.com,True

But more often, they say, the assailants are outsiders: men or in most cases teenage boys who punch, kick, shoot or set afire people living on the streets, frequently killing them, simply for the sport of it, their victims all but invisible to society.

“A lot of what we see are thrill offenders,” said Brian Levin, a criminologist who runs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.

Only Thursday, two homeless men in Hollywood were stabbed to death and a third was wounded in a three-hour spree of separate daylight attacks. The police arrested a 54-year-old local man who they said appeared to have made homeless people his random targets.

Researchers say a combustible mix of factors has added fuel to the problem. Rising unemployment and foreclosures continue to push people into the streets, with some estimates now putting the nationwide number of homeless above one million.

And in cities like Las Vegas, public crackdowns on encampments for the homeless and cutbacks in social services have frequently made street people more visible as targets for would-be assailants.

Further, in the last several years the Internet has seen a proliferation of “bum fight” videos, shot by young men and boys who are seen beating the homeless or who pay transients a few dollars to fight each other.

Indeed, the National Coalition for the Homeless, which works to change government policies and bring people off the streets, says in its new report that 58 percent of assailants implicated in attacks against the homeless in the last 10 years were teenagers.

Michael Stoops, the group’s executive director, said social prejudices were “dehumanizing” the homeless and condoning hostile treatment. He pointed to a blurb titled “Hunt the Homeless” in the current issue of Maxim, a popular men’s magazine. It spotlights a coming “hobo convention” in Iowa and says: “Kill one for fun. We’re 87 percent sure it’s legal.”

With victims wary of going to the police, statistics on the attacks are often incomplete. But surveys show much higher rates of assault, rape and other crimes of violence against the homeless than almost any other group, said Professor Levin, of California State, who worked on the new report.

Recognition of the problem is spurring legislative action.

“More and more, we’re hearing about homeless people being attacked for no other reason than that they’re homeless, and we’ve got to do something about it,” Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, Democrat of Texas, said in an interview.

Ms. Johnson introduced a measure in the House last week to make attacks on the homeless a federal hate crime and require the F.B.I. to collect data on it. (The Senate voted last month to expand federal hate crimes to include attacks on gay and transgender victims, another frequent target.)

And in addition to the measures already approved in Maryland and the District of Columbia, proposals to add penalties for attacks on the homeless are under consideration in California, Florida, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas.

The push has lacked any organized support by major civil rights groups. In Florida, which leads the country in assaults on homeless people, groups like the Anti-Defamation League have opposed recognizing those attacks as a hate crime. Opponents argue that homelessness, unlike race or ethnicity, is not a permanent condition and that such a broadening of the law would have the effect of diluting it.

“I hear the same rhetoric all the time,” Ms. Johnson said. “They ask, ‘Why is their life more important than anyone else’s?’ ”

TEL AVIV (Agence France-Presse) — A masked man opened fire on a crowd at a gay community center in Tel Aviv late Saturday, killing three people and wounding at least 10 others, the Israeli emergency services said.

A young man and a young woman were killed on the spot and the third victim died in hospital, the authorities said, and one of those who were wounded was in serious condition.

The gunman, who was dressed in black, unloaded an automatic weapon as he fired on the group of young gay men and lesbians near the entrance of the center, witnesses said, and he then ran away.

No one had been arrested by early Sunday.

The Tel Aviv police chief, Shahar Ayalon, ordered the closing of a nearby gay bar in the city and urged such establishments to remain vigilant.

Leaders of the gay community said they believed that the shooting was a homophobic attack.

“It is not surprising that such a crime can be committed given the incitement of hatred against the homosexual community,” the president of Tel Aviv’s gay and lesbian community, Mai Pelem, told reporters.

But at least the principle of allowing unpopular opinions to be heard was upheld. That is more than some civil libertarians believe was the case in Chelsea, a Manhattan neighborhood with a large gay and lesbian population.

Like many outlets of the CVS Caremark pharmacy chain, the store in Chelsea at Eighth Avenue and 24th Street has a book rack stocked with texts distributed by a Virginia-based company called Choice Books. These books are the inspirational type, many of them Christian-themed.

Leafing recently through titles like “Emergency Prayers” and “500 Questions & Answers from the Bible,” two Chelsea women were appalled by passages that called homosexuality a “cancer,” sinful and “detestable” to God. The women alerted Chelsea Now, a local newspaper, describing the passages as “hate speech” from which children had to be shielded.

CHELSEA is indeed diverse. Among its residents is Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition. He was appalled, too, but for a different reason: Are we now banning books?

A free society must “oppose inane attempts to silence people and to suppress ideas or to ban books that disagree with us,” Mr. Meyers wrote to Chelsea Now. “The tired canard of ‘protecting’ our children from ‘hate speech’ is exactly the cry of those who have long opposed positive social and cultural change.”

But isn’t hate speech deplorable?

Some people define hate speech as any opinion they dislike, Mr. Meyers told me. Besides, he said, “hate speech is not unconstitutional or illegal.”

A censorious streak runs stubbornly through this city that regards itself as a bastion of tolerance. It has led to the removal of a billboard that challenged immigration policies and of another that quoted a biblical passage condemning homosexuality. It kept an antiwar message from being put up in Times Square during the 2004 Republican National Convention. It stripped Bronx bus shelters of notices about a free health information line for gay men and lesbians. Other examples abound.

Besides being “lazy and disreputable,” censorship can boomerang, Mr. Meyers cautioned. Let it prevail, he said, and there will be nothing to stop other communities from suppressing “the speech that we revere — that in favor of equal rights, pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, for example.”",nytimes.com,True

Four federal agents were killed and 16 others wounded in 1993 during an attempt to serve a search warrant at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., where a stockpile of illegal machine guns had been amassed. The subsequent siege ended disastrously with a raging fire in which scores of people were killed.

In a fund-raising letter in the spring of 1995, LaPierre wrote: “Jack-booted government thugs [have] more power to take away our Constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, destroy our property, and even injure or kill us. ...”

Whatever the N.R.A. may intend by its rhetoric, there is always the danger that those inclined toward violence will incorporate it into their twisted worldview, and will find in the rhetoric a justification for murder. On the second anniversary of the Branch Davidian fire, less than a week after LaPierre’s inflammatory fund-raising letter went out, Timothy McVeigh blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.

You cannot blame the N.R.A. for McVeigh’s actions. But you can sure blame it for ignoring the tragic lessons of history and continuing to spray gasoline into an environment that we have seen explode time and again.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has reported a resurgence of right-wing hate groups in the U.S. since Mr. Obama was elected president. Gun craziness of all kinds, including the passage of local laws making it easier to own and conceal weapons, is on the rise. Hate-filled Web sites are calling attention to the fact that the U.S. has a black president and that his chief of staff is Jewish.

The network’s highest-rated star, Bill O’Reilly, had assailed Tiller, calling him “Tiller the baby killer” and likening him to the Nazis, on 29 of his shows before the doctor was murdered at his church in Kansas. O’Reilly was unrepentant, stating that only “pro-abortion zealots and Fox News haters” would link him to the crime. But now another Fox star, while stopping short of blaming O’Reilly, was breaching his network’s brand of political correctness: he tied the far-right loners who had gotten their guns out in Wichita and Washington to the mounting fury of Obama haters.

What is this fury about? In his scant 145 days in office, the new president has not remotely matched the Bush record in deficit creation. Nor has he repealed the right to bear arms or exacerbated the wars he inherited. He has tried more than his predecessor ever did to reach across the aisle. But none of that seems to matter. A sizable minority of Americans is irrationally fearful of the fast-moving generational, cultural and racial turnover Obama embodies — indeed, of the 21st century itself. That minority is now getting angrier in inverse relationship to his popularity with the vast majority of the country. Change can be frightening and traumatic, especially if it’s not change you can believe in.

We don’t know whether the tiny subset of domestic terrorists in this crowd is egged on by political or media demagogues — though we do tend to assume that foreign jihadists respond like Pavlov’s dogs to the words of their most fanatical leaders and polemicists. But well before the latest murderers struck — well before another “antigovernment” Obama hater went on a cop-killing rampage in Pittsburgh in April — there have been indications that this rage could spiral out of control.

This was evident during the campaign, when hotheads greeted Obama’s name with “Treason!” and “Terrorist!” at G.O.P. rallies. At first the McCain-Palin campaign fed the anger with accusations that Obama was “palling around with terrorists.” But later John McCain thought better of it and defended his opponent’s honor to a town-hall participant who vented her fears of the Democrats’ “Arab” candidate. Although two neo-Nazi skinheads were arrested in an assassination plot against Obama two weeks before Election Day, the fever broke after McCain exercised leadership.

That honeymoon, if it was one, is over. Conservatives have legitimate ideological beefs with Obama, rightly expressed in sharp language. But the invective in some quarters has unmistakably amped up. The writer Camille Paglia, a political independent and confessed talk-radio fan, detected a shift toward paranoia in the air waves by mid-May. When “the tone darkens toward a rhetoric of purgation and annihilation,” she observed in Salon, “there is reason for alarm.” She cited a “joke” repeated by a Rush Limbaugh fill-in host, a talk-radio jock from Dallas of all places, about how “any U.S. soldier” who found himself with only two bullets in an elevator with Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and Osama bin Laden would use both shots to assassinate Pelosi and then strangle Reid and bin Laden.

This homicide-saturated vituperation is endemic among mini-Limbaughs. Glenn Beck has dipped into O’Reilly’s Holocaust analogies to liken Obama’s policy on stem-cell research to the eugenics that led to “the final solution” and the quest for “a master race.” After James von Brunn’s rampage at the Holocaust museum, Beck rushed onto Fox News to describe the Obama-hating killer as a “lone gunman nutjob.” Yet in the same show Beck also said von Brunn was a symptom that “the pot in America is boiling,” as if Beck himself were not the boiling pot cheering the kettle on.

But hyperbole from the usual suspects in the entertainment arena of TV and radio is not the whole story. What’s startling is the spillover of this poison into the conservative political establishment. Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan G.O.P. chairman who ran for the party’s national chairmanship this year, seriously suggested in April that Republicans should stop calling Obama a socialist because “it no longer has the negative connotation it had 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago.” Anuzis pushed “fascism” instead, because “everybody still thinks that’s a bad thing.” He didn’t seem to grasp that “fascism” is nonsensical as a description of the Obama administration or that there might be a risk in slurring a president with a word that most find “bad” because it evokes a mass-murderer like Hitler.

The Anuzis “fascism” solution to the Obama problem has caught fire. The president’s nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court and his speech in Cairo have only exacerbated the ugliness. The venomous personal attacks on Sotomayor have little to do with the 3,000-plus cases she’s adjudicated in nearly 17 years on the bench or her thoughts about the judgment of “a wise Latina woman.” She has been tarred as a member of “the Latino KKK” (by the former Republican presidential candidate Tom Tancredo), as well as a racist and a David Duke (by Limbaugh), and portrayed, in a bizarre two-for-one ethnic caricature, as a slant-eyed Asian on the cover of National Review. Uniting all these insults is an aggrieved note of white victimization only a shade less explicit than that in von Brunn’s white supremacist screeds.

Obama’s Cairo address, meanwhile, prompted over-the-top accusations reminiscent of those campaign rally cries of “Treason!” It was a prominent former Reagan defense official, Frank Gaffney, not some fringe crackpot, who accused Obama in The Washington Times of engaging “in the most consequential bait-and-switch since Adolf Hitler duped Neville Chamberlain.” He claimed that the president — a lifelong Christian — “may still be” a Muslim and is aligned with “the dangerous global movement known as the Muslim Brotherhood.” Gaffney linked Obama by innuendo with Islamic “charities” that “have been convicted of providing material support for terrorism.”

If this isn’t a handy rationalization for another lone nutjob to take the law into his own hands against a supposed terrorism supporter, what is? Any such nutjob can easily grab a weapon. Gun enthusiasts have been on a shopping spree since the election, with some areas of our country reporting percentage sales increases in the mid-to-high double digits, recession be damned.

The question, Shepard Smith said on Fox last week, is “if there is really a way to put a hold on” those who might run amok. We’re not about to repeal the First or Second Amendments. Hard-core haters resolutely dismiss any “mainstream media” debunking of their conspiracy theories. The only voices that might penetrate their alternative reality — I emphasize might — belong to conservative leaders with the guts and clout to step up as McCain did last fall. Where are they? The genteel public debate in right-leaning intellectual circles about the conservative movement’s future will be buried by history if these insistent alarms are met with silence.

It’s typical of this dereliction of responsibility that when the Department of Homeland Security released a plausible (and, tragically, prescient) report about far-right domestic terrorism two months ago, the conservative response was to trash it as “the height of insult,” in the words of the G.O.P. chairman Michael Steele. But as Smith also said last week, Homeland Security was “warning us for a reason.”

No matter. Last week it was business as usual, as Republican leaders nattered ad infinitum over the juvenile rivalry of Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich at the party’s big Washington fund-raiser. Few if any mentioned, let alone questioned, the ominous script delivered by the actor Jon Voight with the G.O.P. imprimatur at that same event. Voight’s devout wish was to “bring an end to this false prophet Obama.”

An April assessment by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis said pointedly: “Lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing violent rightwing extremist ideology are the most dangerous domestic terrorism threat in the United States.”

Slowly, but steadily, these bigots are slithering from beneath their rocks, armed and deadly.

The most recent was an octogenarian-hater named James von Brunn, who, officials said, opened fire this week in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, killing a security guard.

Just as disturbing as the incidents themselves are the lineups of family, friends and neighbors who emerge to talk about the vitriol they heard and the warning signs they saw. I always want the interviewer to stop and ask them this simple question: “And when he said or did that, how did you respond?”

I would ask: What did you say or do as the shooters retreated into their xenophobic silo and consumed the bile slouching about the Internet? What did you say or do as the darkness in their hearts obscured the light of their reasoning, and the vacuum of hate consumed them?

Mr. Johns was a security guard. The bullet that killed him was a reminder of the continuing menace of bigotry and violence that pervades this country — and that we insist on underestimating.

The authorities have identified an 88-year-old, hard-core white supremacist, James von Brunn, as the killer. Our knee-jerk tendency is to comfort ourselves by declaring that this guy is so freakish, so far out of the American mainstream, that he is not representative of much of anything. Sane people are not violently obsessed with blacks and Jews. The murder was a tragic aberration. After all, this is a country that only recently elected an African-American president.

So let’s mop up the blood from the museum floor, and try to keep matters in perspective.

The problem when we think in terms of freaks and aberrations is that there are so many of them, which calls into question just how freakish or aberrational they really are. Was it an aberration when, according to authorities, Scott Roeder went into the lobby of a Lutheran church in Wichita two weeks ago and shot Dr. George Tiller to death? Hardly. The murder of Dr. Tiller, who was the nation’s most prominent provider of so-called late-term abortions, was the fourth assassination of an abortion provider in the U.S. since 1993.

Three Pittsburgh police officers were murdered in April by a man with a high-powered rifle who, according to authorities, was later linked to racist and anti-Semitic items posted on white supremacist Web sites. The man was identified as 22-year-old Richard Poplawski. According to the Anti-Defamation League, Poplawski, who wore a Nazi-style tattoo, believed Zionists were running the world and that President Obama was planning to crack down on gun ownership.

Exhibit A for the mainstreaming of right-wing extremism is Fox News’s new star, Glenn Beck. Here we have a network where, like it or not, millions of Americans get their news — and it gives daily airtime to a commentator who, among other things, warned viewers that the Federal Emergency Management Agency might be building concentration camps as part of the Obama administration’s “totalitarian” agenda (although he eventually conceded that nothing of the kind was happening).

But let’s not neglect the print news media. In the Bush years, The Washington Times became an important media player because it was widely regarded as the Bush administration’s house organ. Earlier this week, the newspaper saw fit to run an opinion piece declaring that President Obama “not only identifies with Muslims, but actually may still be one himself,” and that in any case he has “aligned himself” with the radical Muslim Brotherhood.

And then there’s Rush Limbaugh. His rants today aren’t very different from his rants in 1993. But he occupies a different position in the scheme of things. Remember, during the Bush years Mr. Limbaugh became very much a political insider. Indeed, according to a recent Gallup survey, 10 percent of Republicans now consider him the “main person who speaks for the Republican Party today,” putting him in a three-way tie with Dick Cheney and Newt Gingrich. So when Mr. Limbaugh peddles conspiracy theories — suggesting, for example, that fears over swine flu were being hyped “to get people to respond to government orders” — that’s a case of the conservative media establishment joining hands with the lunatic fringe.

It’s not surprising, then, that politicians are doing the same thing. The R.N.C. says that “the Democratic Party is dedicated to restructuring American society along socialist ideals.” And when Jon Voight, the actor, told the audience at a Republican fund-raiser this week that the president is a “false prophet” and that “we and we alone are the right frame of mind to free this nation from this Obama oppression,” Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, thanked him, saying that he “really enjoyed” the remarks.

Credit where credit is due. Some figures in the conservative media have refused to go along with the big hate — people like Fox’s Shepard Smith and Catherine Herridge, who debunked the attacks on that Homeland Security report two months ago. But this doesn’t change the broad picture, which is that supposedly respectable news organizations and political figures are giving aid and comfort to dangerous extremism.

What will the consequences be? Nobody knows, of course, although the analysts at Homeland Security fretted that things may turn out even worse than in the 1990s — that thanks, in part, to the election of an African-American president, “the threat posed by lone wolves and small terrorist cells is more pronounced than in past years.”

Mr. von Brunn’s actions were “not what this country stands for,” Mr. Persichini said, adding that it was important to send a message that the F.B.I. would stop “other Mr. von Brunns that are around here in this nation today.”

Mr. von Brunn, who lived in Lebanon, N.H., at the time of the Federal Reserve incident, told the police he wanted to take Fed board members hostage to focus attention on their responsibility for high interest rates and the nation’s economic difficulties.

Local and federal authorities in Washington said Thursday that they were focusing on Mr. von Brunn’s intentions and how he got the rifle. Because of his felony conviction in the crime at the Federal Reserve, he was prohibited by federal law from buying or possessing a gun. But Mr. von Brunn could have had the rifle, described by the authorities as “an older weapon,” since well before his conviction.

Prosecutors said the Varrio gang had its own code of ethics; drive-by shootings from moving cars are forbidden and breaches of gang hierarchies are brutally punished. Members also broadcast animosity toward blacks by regarding themselves as the “Hate Gang.”

She said the defendants were displaying a casual attitude that she found shocking. “The trial should have been held in public,” she said, “so that everyone could know what took place.”

The law mandating that the trial be closed applies to defendants who were under 18 at the time of the crime, even if they are no longer minors. In this case, two of the accused were 17 when Mr. Halimi was kidnapped. Only they can ask that the secrecy be lifted, and they did not do so.

Lawyers on both sides of the case voiced regret.

“The culture of secrecy has no place in a democracy,” said Daphné Pugliesi, who is representing Cédric Birot Saint-Yves, who has been charged with being one of Mr. Halimi’s “jailers.” Ms. Pugliesi asserted that the aim of a criminal trial was “for society to understand the reasons why a grave crime like this one was committed.”

Francis Szpiner, the attorney of the Halimi family, noted that the European Convention on Human Rights, which is above French law, states as a principle that trials should be open. “I think we need to change this law,” Mr. Szpiner said. “We should say that trials are open and that it’s up to minors to request an exception, and not the contrary.”

In the United States, only a narrowly tailored government interest of the highest order can justify even the partial closure of a trial. It is almost inconceivable that an entire murder trial involving several defendants, some of them adults, would be closed because some minors were involved.

But Mr. Dubet contended that the French feel more strongly than Americans about protecting the rights of minors in such situations.

As a result of the media ban, virtually nothing will be known soon about what is said by the accused — 18 men and 9 women, all French nationals aged 20 to 35 — or the 162 witnesses and 50 experts who are expected to testify before the trial is to conclude on July 10.

The limited coverage now is in contrast to the extensive analysis and reporting when the horrific details of Mr. Halimi’s death emerged. In the aftermath, many people turned out to demonstrate against racism and anti-Semitism in marches in Paris and other cities.

The other defendants are charged with crimes ranging from entrapment and sequestration that resulted in death to failing to assist a person in peril.

The defendants come from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. Like Mr. Fofana, many of them lived in the southern Paris suburb of Bagneux, where Mr. Halimi was held.

When the trial began on April 29, reporters were allowed into the courtroom for a few hours — long enough to hear Mr. Fofana shout “Allah Akbar,” God is Great, and declare his date of birth as Feb. 13, 2006, the day Mr. Halimi was found dying alongside railroad tracks in a suburb south of Bagneux.

Mr. Fofana’s outburst set the tone for proceedings that have been disrupted by threats to jurors, threats to Jewish defense lawyers and a nationwide strike by prison guards whose clashes with riot police officers last week blocked the transfer of defendants to the court.

On May 7, the trial was suspended for a day when one of the accused complained that he had been punched and hit by a Taser during clashes outside his prison, and pulled up his T-shirt to show the marks, according to the newspaper Le Monde and a blog published by the magazine Le Nouvel Observateur, which has stood out among news media for trying to follow the trial daily, mostly through conversations with lawyers.

On May 12, according to the Observateur blog, the presiding judge, Nadia Ajjan, appointed two new lawyers to represent Mr. Fofana because of the frequent absence from court of his original attorneys: Emmanuel Ludot, who helped defend Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2004, and Isabelle Coutant-Peyre, who is married to the terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal and has defended several radical Islamists.

One of the issues debated since the crime took place is the police’s handling of Mr. Halimi’s kidnapping. Mrs. Halimi asserts in “24 Days,” a scathing book published last month, that the elite Criminal Brigade bungled the case by imposing secrecy during the kidnapping and by missing several opportunities to arrest Mr. Fofana, who made two trips to Ivory Coast while Mr. Halimi was being held.

Mrs. Halimi contends that the Criminal Brigade failed to inform other police branches about the kidnapping, allowing Mr. Fofana to elude capture on at least two occasions in Paris and when going through passport control at the airport.

Asked about those allegations, a police spokesman declined to comment on the book but said that if an inquiry was deemed necessary, police investigators would be called in by the judicial authorities to examine how the case was handled. He declined to give his name.

Lawyers interviewed on the sidelines of the trial said they believed the defendants were not tightly organized gangsters, but rudderless youths who had been influenced by anti-Semitic rhetoric.

Mr. Halimi was kidnapped on Jan. 20, 2006, just weeks after rioting erupted across France in low-income suburbs. Many of the rioters were young people of North African or black African origin, and many were Muslim.

Mrs. Halimi said the anti-Semitic aspect of her son’s kidnapping made it all the more imperative for the world to know what was said at the trial. “We need to educate people, beginning with the parents so that they can educate their children,” she said. “We need to educate them that all people are equal.”",nytimes.com,True

A federal investigation of the crime and the police’s handling of it is under way. The case has also become something of a cause célèbre for national Hispanic organizations, including the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or Maldef, which has begun a national petition calling for the Justice Department to bring federal hate crime charges against the assailants and has called for the Senate to pass legislation strengthening the federal hate crime law. Similar legislation was passed by the House last month.

“This case is not just about what happened to Luís; it’s about what Latinos nationally are facing,” said John Amaya, a staff lawyer with Maldef, who added that Mr. Ramírez’s death was part of a larger trend of violence against Latinos. He pointed to federal crime statistics that show a 40 percent increase in attacks on Hispanics from 2003 to 2007.

And while many white residents said there were no racial tensions locally except those being sparked by news coverage and claims from out-of-town civil rights groups, Latinos offered a different view.

Mr. Ramírez, an illegal immigrant and a 25-year-old farmhand and factory worker, was beaten on July 12, the authorities say, in a fight that started after several football players from the local high school who had been drinking made remarks to the 15-year-old girl walking with him.

The Matthew Shepard Act, which if passed by the Senate would expand the 1968 federal hate crimes law to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes, is long overdue (editorial, May 6).

In today’s world, which is so diverse, we cannot condone violence based on actual or perceived identity. If we do, we are all vulnerable.

At the New York City Anti-Violence Project, we know that more is needed. We also must stop the violence from happening in the first place. This requires public education and training of first responders and law enforcement.

We know in New York that hate-crimes protection can be a powerful tool in prosecuting crimes, but it does not prevent them. Each year we see violence against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities increase, despite this legislation.

To prosecute these crimes is one way to vindicate the lives of those who died because of who they are, and we have an obligation to do so. But to truly eradicate violence, we have to go beyond punitive measures to preventive ones, so that we don’t lose another Matthew Shepard to this senseless violence.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/opinion/06wed3.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"After years of unconscionable delay, the House has approved legislation that would, for the first time, extend federal hate-crimes law to give substantive coverage to gay people. The act would be an important step forward in protecting all minorities from violence and a tribute to a young man whose life was cut short by bigotry.

In 1998, Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old University of Wyoming student, who was singled out by his attackers because he was gay, was tied to a fence, tortured and left in a coma to die.

His death galvanized a national movement to extend hate-crimes protection to gay men and lesbians, but it has also galvanized stiff opposition. Two years ago, a hate-crimes bill that included gay people stalled after President George W. Bush threatened to veto it.

The Matthew Shepard Act, as the bill is known in the Senate, would provide increased funding to state and local authorities to prosecute a wide range of hate crimes — ones motivated by race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. It would also authorize the federal government to prosecute these crimes when states fail to do so.

The biggest beneficiaries would probably be African-Americans, who make up the largest group of hate-crime victims. It would also help Hispanics, who have been increasing targets of anti-immigrant hatred. The bill’s opponents have focused on the protection of gay people, who were the victims in more than 16 percent of the hate crimes reported by the F.B.I. in 2007.

In addition to providing more resources, the act would serve an important public education role, underscoring the seriousness and horror of these crimes. In a particularly ugly moment in last week’s House debate, Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, declared that Mr. Shepard’s death was “a hoax,” repeating a right-wing canard that he was not a target because he was gay.

(AP) — Prosecutors called the beating death of an illegal immigrant from Mexico a hate crime, and they urged an all-white jury in Pennsylvania coal country to punish two white teenagers for their roles in the attack.

But the jury found the teenagers not guilty of all serious charges, eliciting cheers and claps from the defendants’ families and friends — and cries of outrage from the victim’s.

One of the defendants, Brandon Piekarsky, 17, was acquitted of third-degree murder and ethnic intimidation, while the other, Derrick Donchak, 19, was acquitted of aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation. They were both convicted of simple assault late Friday after a trial in which jurors were left to sort out the facts of an epithet-filled brawl that pitted popular football players against a 25-year-old Hispanic man, Luis Ramirez, who appeared willing to fight.

A representative of Mr. Ramirez’s family said the jurors got it wrong. “There’s been a complete failure of justice,” said Gladys Limon, staff lawyer for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, who attended the trial and informed Mr. Ramirez’s family of the verdict. “It’s just outrageous and very difficult to understand how any juror could have had reasonable doubt.”",nytimes.com,True

Of the prosecutors, Mr. Fanelli said: “They chose to make this case about race. Why when the injured person is white is it a street fight, and when the injured person is a minority is it a hate crime?”

The beating occurred on the night of July 12, and Mr. Ramírez died of head injuries two days later. Mr. Piekarski faces the most serious charge, criminal homicide, because, prosecutors say, he kicked Mr. Ramírez in the head as he lay unconscious on the ground after being punched by another of the six youths. That kick proved to be the fatal blow, the prosecution says.

Mr. Donchak is charged with aggravated assault and other counts, including that of supplying a dozen 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor to his five friends before the fight.

Then, when a protest outside the Pottsville courthouse, by a group supporting immigrant rights, grew so loud that it disrupted a preliminary hearing for Mr. Piekarski and Mr. Donchak, the county sheriff decided to bolster security for the trial.

Determined to keep protesters a quarter-mile from the courthouse, the sheriff, Joseph G. Groody, called in help from the local police and state troopers, who patrolled the area surrounding the courthouse Monday while a half-dozen sheriff’s deputies guarded the courtroom.

But a large rally against illegal immigration was canceled, and only three people in all showed up outside the courthouse, holding signs that said, “Self-Defense Knows No Race.”

“So far it’s been good, and I hope it stays that way,” Sheriff Groody said. “But when it comes down to the day of the verdict, I’m sure that will be a busy day.”

“One of the characteristics of hate crimes is the use of extreme brutality,” said Kelly Costello, director of advocacy at the Colorado Anti-Violence Program. “This is one of those cases, which is why it’s so important to see it designated as a hate crime.”

Colorado is one of 11 states, and the District of Columbia, that have hate-crimes laws that cover gender identity. That charge here carries an additional sentence of up to three years. Mr. Andrade is already facing life in prison for the first-degree murder charge.

But that has not changed the reality that Iraq remains religious, conservative — and still violent. The killers, the police say, are not just Shiite death squads, but also tribal and family members shamed by their gay relatives.

Clerics in Sadr City have urged followers to help root out homosexuality in Iraqi society, and the police have begun their own crackdown on gay men.

Gay men and lesbians in Iraq have long been among the targets of both Shiite and Sunni death squads, but their murders have been overshadowed by the hundreds of overall weekly casualties during the height of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007.

In 2005, the country’s most influential Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, issued a religious decree that said gay men and lesbians should be “punished, in fact, killed.” He added, “The people should be killed in the worst, most severe way of killing.” The language has since been removed from his Web site.

In recent months, groups of gay men have been taking greater chances, gathering in cafes and other public places in Baghdad, Basra, Najaf and other cities. On a recent night in Sadr City, several, their hair parted down the middle, talked as they quietly sipped tea at a garishly lighted cafe, oblivious to the stares of passers-by.

The chief of a Sadr City police station, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to reporters, said family members had probably committed most of the Sadr City killings. He played down the role of death squads that had once been associated with the Mahdi Army, the militia that controlled Sadr City until American and Iraqi forces dislodged them last spring.

According to the complaint, Mr. Phoenix hit Jose Sucuzhanay “repeatedly” with the bat. He faces a possible maximum sentence of 25 years to life if convicted. Mr. Sucuzhanay, an owner of a real estate agency in Brooklyn, died on Dec. 12 at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens.

Jay H. Schwitzman, a lawyer for Mr. Phoenix, said his client has denied the charges and is looking forward to establishing his innocence.

In court, Mr. Schwitzman said that Mr. Phoenix was defending himself after Jose Sucuzhanay appeared to reach for a concealed weapon. “The deceased was the aggressor,” Mr. Schwitzman said.

He later told reporters that one of the Sucuzhanay brothers had kicked the door of the vehicle Mr. Phoenix was driving. Mr. Scott, also from the Bronx, got out, he said. A fight started, and Mr. Phoenix went to break it up, Mr. Schwitzman added.

“To me, it is not a gay bashing or gay hate crime,” he said.

He later said in a telephone interview that Jose Sucuzhanay “reached for something in his waistband and Mr. Phoenix believed it was a deadly weapon. As to what it was, I do not have the details.”

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/nyregion/28beating.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"The second suspect in the brutal December beating death of an Ecuadorean immigrant in Brooklyn did not bother to offer any denials upon his arrest on Friday morning, according to the police.

“So I killed someone,” Keith Phoenix, 28, told New York police detectives who found him hiding in the bathroom of a Yonkers apartment, the police said. “That makes me a bad guy?”

The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, who appeared at a morning news conference with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other officials, said Mr. Phoenix made a full confession in the killing of Jose O. Sucuzhanay, in Bushwick.

Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Sucuzhanay was walking arm in arm with his brother Romel Sucuzhanay on Dec. 7 when they were attacked by Mr. Phoenix and another Bronx man, Hakim Scott, who the police say were shouting antigay and anti-Hispanic slurs. Mr. Scott hit Jose Sucuzhanay on the head with a bottle, Mr. Kelly said. Mr. Phoenix hit him in the head with an aluminum baseball bat, knocking him down, and then returned to hit him again when he saw him move, Mr. Kelly said.

“This horrible act appears to have been fueled by a deadly combination of ethnic and homophobic prejudice,” Mayor Bloomberg said.

Asked whether Mr. Phoenix had expressed any remorse, he said, “None whatsoever.”

Mr. Scott, 25, was arrested on Wednesday and arraigned in criminal court on Thursday on a charge of second-degree murder as a hate crime. A grand jury has been hearing evidence since Mr. Scott’s arrest, and Mr. Phoenix will face a similar charge, said Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney.

At a news conference on Friday afternoon, Jose Arrufat Gracia, a lawyer for the Sucuzhanay family, said that they felt “some relief” with the arrests but that it was “very painful” for them to see Mr. Phoenix smiling in a video taken at a tollbooth at the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge 19 minutes after the fatal beating.

The police released the video on Thursday to help in their search for Mr. Phoenix. Mr. Arrufat Gracia attended the news conference with two of the victim’s brothers, Romel and Diego Sucuzhanay. The brothers declined to speak.

Detectives led Mr. Phoenix out of the 83rd Precinct station house in Bushwick on Friday just before 6 p.m. to take him to court. With his hands cuffed behind his back and his legs shackled, he said nothing as reporters shouted questions at him, and he kept his head up and looked straight ahead as he was taken to an unmarked car.

Someone from a crowd of onlookers shouted, “You’re not smiling now, are you?” a reference to the surveillance video.

Mr. Kelly said on Friday that in their search for Mr. Phoenix, detectives had checked scores of locations in Upper Manhattan, the Bronx and Connecticut. Early Friday, detectives returned to one of them, where they were told that Mr. Phoenix might be at an apartment in Yonkers on Ravine Avenue.

When detectives went there at 2:30 a.m., an elderly woman let them in, and when they opened the bathroom door, they found Mr. Phoenix, standing and dressed in jeans, sneakers and a T-shirt, Mr. Kelly said. The woman worked at a group home where a female acquaintance of Mr. Phoenix’s had been raised.

Mr. Phoenix was arrested without incident, an official said.

An early break in the beating investigation came from a taxi driver who jotted down the license plate of the attackers’ car, a sport utility vehicle that the police say Mr. Phoenix was driving when he and Mr. Scott saw the brothers.

The authorities identified the vehicle as one that Mr. Phoenix had driven before, and surmised the suspects’ likeliest route from the attack scene. After scouring hours of videotape at the toll booth of the former Triborough Bridge, they found the frames that showed him driving the car 19 minutes after the attack.

“This investigation began with a license plate number and little else,” Mr. Kelly said.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/nyregion/27video.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"The man pulled into a tollbooth on the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge and reached his hand out the window to pay the attendant. He was smiling and appeared to be laughing with the other occupants of the car, so heartily that his body shook. He passed some change to someone in the back seat, then drove off.

It was Dec. 7, 2008, at 3:47 a.m., exactly 19 minutes after the police say that the man, Keith Phoenix, 28, was involved in the beating death of a man named Jose O. Sucuzhanay on a Brooklyn street.

Mr. Phoenix has not been found. The police have offered a $22,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction.

The images at the tollbooth at the Kennedy bridge, formerly called the Triborough Bridge, were captured by a video camera and released by the police on Thursday. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announced the night before that the authorities were looking for him.

Mr. Phoenix, who lives in the Bronx, and another man, Hakim Scott, 25, are suspected in the attack on Mr. Sucuzhanay and his brother Romel, who were walking arm-in-arm on a Bushwick street after a church party.

The authorities said that Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Scott stopped their vehicle at a red light and attacked the brothers, using racial and homophobic slurs. Mr. Scott hit Mr. Sucuzhanay over the head with a bottle, according to the criminal complaint, and another man who acted “in concert” with Mr. Scott, identified by the authorities as Mr. Phoenix, repeatedly beat Mr. Sucuzhanay about the head and body with a bat.

Mr. Scott, who was arrested on Wednesday, confessed to the attack, Mr. Kelly has said. He appeared in Brooklyn Criminal Court on Thursday to face a charge of second-degree murder as a hate crime.

A judge ruled that Mr. Scott would remain in custody after hearing recommendations from Josh Hanshaft, the prosecutor in the case, that he be held due to the “extreme viciousness of this crime.”

If convicted, Mr. Scott could face a life sentence.

He will enter a plea to any charge issued in an indictment when he is arraigned next month.

His lawyer, Craig Newman, said outside the courtroom after the hearing on Thursday that “the plea is not guilty right now.”

Mr. Newman said that he had no comment when asked about the mind-set of his client.

“As to what evidence there is, I have got more information from the press than from the district attorney’s office,” he said.

State parole officers swarmed Mr. Phoenix’s apartment building on Andrews Avenue in the University Heights neighborhood of the Bronx on Thursday looking for him. A parole officer who declined to be identified said Mr. Phoenix had been “doing well.”

No one answered at the apartment where Mr. Phoenix lived with his mother; a dozen residents who were interviewed said they did not know him.",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Phoenix then took an aluminum baseball bat from the rear of the vehicle and struck Jose repeatedly on his shoulder, ribs and back until he fell, the police said.

“At that point Phoenix struck Jose several more times, full force, with crushing blows to his head,” said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, who announced the arrest at a news conference at Police Headquarters on Wednesday evening with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney. Once in custody, Mr. Scott “made a full confession,” Mr. Kelly said.

If convicted, Mr. McInerney, now 15, could face 51 years to life in prison. He is accused of shooting Mr. King, who was in the eighth grade, twice in the head in English class.

Subtitled “After Grief and Anger — Healing and Change,” the performance was an effort to promote better understanding between Latinos and non-Latinos in the area following the killing last November in Patchogue of Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant. Seven teenagers have been charged in the fatal attack, and investigations are under way into other reported bias attacks on Latinos in Suffolk County.

Such legal proceedings “are pretty intimidating for the community,” Paul McIsaac, the director of Playback (NYC), said a few days before the church performance. “Patchogue Stories,” he said, would be a way for people “to begin to talk to one another.”

Part of an international improvisational theater movement, Playback (NYC) invites audience members to tell stories from their lives, which are enacted using a mix of spontaneous dialogue, mime and music.

To the Rev. Dwight Lee Wolter, the pastor of the Congregational Church, a historic building on Patchogue’s Main Street, telling stories in church seemed especially apt. “What did Jesus do? He told stories,” Mr. Wolter said in an interview. “Almost everything he did was telling a parable or telling a story.”

More than 100 people filled the church reception room for “Patchogue Stories,” including a film crew and police and county government representatives. An art exhibition in the room featured the work of Ecuadorean immigrant painters. (“I work in a factory, but I’m also an artist,” Julio Guncay, who had two landscapes on view, said in Spanish to a reporter. “There are many sides” to the immigrant experience, he said, “that sometimes people don’t know.”)

Some who attended might have expected stories to bear directly on the events that have roiled Patchogue. While there were some references to anti-Latino sentiment, including an account by Mel Guadalupe, the Suffolk County director of minority affairs, about coming to grips with his Puerto Rican heritage, the stories generally struck an optimistic note.

The Playback troupe will perform another improvised theater event on March 6 for students at Patchogue-Medford High School, as part of the school’s annual Cultural Awareness Day.

Jose Perez, a lawyer for LatinoJustice P.R.L.D.E.F., an advocacy group, said the new cases were “the tip of the iceberg” in a pattern of violence against Hispanics, and show that a more aggressive police response to earlier attacks could have prevented Mr. Lucero’s death.

After Mr. Lucero died, many other immigrants came forward to describe attacks. Some had never been reported; others were reported to police at the time, but no one was arrested, in part because language barriers made communication difficult, Mr. Spota said.

Investigators who were searching for new suspects showed more than 20 victims photographs of more than 20 of the defendants’ friends and acquaintances, but none were identified as assailants by any of the victims, the law enforcement official said.

Another man, Jose Hernandez, was attacked three times in a week in December 2007 by members of the group, prosecutors said. In one incident, they said, Mr. Conroy held a pipe in one hand and smacked it against his other palm, saying “We’re going to kill you.”

Lawyers for the defendants questioned how the victims could have identified their clients after so long, and suggested that prosecutors were pinning every possible assault on them.

Mr. Spota said prosecutors had considered the possibility that victims only thought they recognized the defendants because they had seen them in media coverage, and were careful to seek corroborating evidence.

The law enforcement official said that photo lineups were used to identify the suspects. In one case, Mr. Hartford, Mr. Hausch and Mr. Dasch are charged with attacking a man prosecutors identified as Petronila Fuentes Diaz on the night that Mr. Lucero was killed.

The Suffolk County police commissioner, Richard Dormer, has acknowledged that the police appeared to have missed a pattern, and ordered an audit of all reports in the Fifth Precinct, which includes Patchogue. But he has denied that the department discriminated against Latino victims in its investigation of crimes.

“We welcome the D.O.J. looking into these incidents, many of which had not been reported until recently,” the police said in a statement.

LatinoJustice P.R.L.D.E.F., an advocacy group, called for a federal investigation in a letter to the Justice Department dated Nov. 25. The letter accused Suffolk County of failing to investigate “an epidemic of hate crimes against Latinos.”

Cesar A. Perales, president of LatinoJustice, said the federal action indicated that authorities “believe that there are other people who have not been charged with crimes who should have been charged with crimes.” The United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are also involved.

When it became clear that Mr. Obama had won, one said “Let’s go out” and beat up African-Americans, using a racial slur.

They got into a 1998 blue Toyota Camry driven by Mr. Nicoletti, agreeing they would take turns being the “main aggressor,” the inspector said.

Three of the men got out behind him. “And to throw him off, they yell ‘Obama!’ — sort of like to disarm him,” Inspector Osgood said. “And he turns around to yell ‘Obama!’ back in celebration, and they start to beat him” with fists, feet, a pipe and the asp.

They stopped when one of the men noticed that the man might be mentally disabled, the inspector said.

Just before 1 a.m., back in the car, they spotted a man from behind on Blackford Avenue, wearing a hood and baggy jeans. They thought he was black, but he was a 38-year-old white man named Ronald Forte.

It was Mr. Contreras’s turn, so he prepared to hit him with the asp, Inspector Osgood said.

But Mr. Nicoletti hit Mr. Forte with the car instead, sending him smashing into the windshield and tumbling to the ground.

Mr. Forte was in a coma for 45 days.

Inspector Osgood said task force detectives were already prepared on election night in case of disturbances. They learned of the attack on Alie Kamara from a 911 call. When they found out about the salon incident from an article in The Staten Island Advance, they suspected a pattern.

Inspector Osgood said investigators slowly made progress, using tips about the four men from a confidential informant who saw the fliers in the Rosebank neighborhood, where three of the defendants live, and also by using police databases.

But initially the other three incidents were unknown to the police: The black and Hispanic men who were attacked and threatened never came forward. Investigators had heard that the attackers had hit someone with a car, and they knew that Mr. Forte was found in the street, but because he was white they did not immediately make a connection.

After the investigators checked every auto glass shop on Staten Island, an F.B.I. agent found a mobile glass repair company with a regional office in New Jersey. Investigators were able to confirm that the windshield of the car that Mr. Nicoletti was driving on Nov. 4 had just been repaired by that company. It was not until Sergeant Rodrigo got one of the men to talk on a street corner outside the bank that the police strung together all of the events. The authorities would not publicly disclose which of the suspects he spoke with, saying it would endanger him.

“The whole thing doesn’t make sense,” Inspector Osgood said. “In all our hate-crime cases over this decade, it was just one victim at just one point in time.

And a citizen of Patchogue where, he said, he knows most everybody in the village and had always felt safe. And welcome. “If you really think about it, the first people who lived in this country were American Indians, and that means the rest of us are basically all aliens. Or that we are all the same.”

He said he still feels safe here “except maybe at night on weekends.”

Pablo got back to his predinner assignment, creating a pleasing ambience in the dining room. One votive candle for every table. Each candle strategically placed, much like those at the shrine down the street.

He said this is a job he is grateful to have — he and his fellow busboy, Jose Granados, also 16 and also an American citizen, although of Salvadoran descent, intend to go to college to study mechanics. Both said their boss, Angelo Galeotafiore, treats them well. No condescension; no hint of anti-immigrant bias; no racism, or racist jokes, in his kitchen. “He’s good to everyone,” Pablo said. “He teaches us the right way to do things.”

And why not, said Mr. Galeotafiore, 37, whose father, Carmine, immigrated to Brooklyn from Italy in 1965 and has presided over Patchogue’s signature Italian butcher shop, the Del Fiore Italian Pork Store, for 38 years. “My father was an immigrant with a seventh-grade education who came here from Tufino, Italy, because there were no opportunities for him to better himself there,” Mr. Galeotafiore said, taking a break from his duties as chef at Mangia Mangia, which opened in 2005. He views the path taken by the Matute and Granados families as not so different from that blazed by his own parents.

“What if Patchogue had closed its doors to my father? What if it had discriminated against his dream?” Mr. Galeotafiore said. “The Marcelo incident makes me sick to my stomach; I’m afraid to talk in absolutes, but I’m sure it’s not who we are as a community. I’m an immigrant’s son, and like the rest of this family, I’m invested in this community.”

So Carmine Galeotafiore, with help from his son Lorenzo, still runs the Pork Store and still hand-shapes its famed mozzarella balls. “That seems to be one business that’s recession-proof,” said Angelo Galeotafiore, a 1995 graduate of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park. He chose to branch out, first with a gourmet pizzeria opened in 1997, then with Mangia Mangia and most recently with Muchachos, a fast-fresh-food Mexican spot that opened in October.

Assisted by a new generation of immigrants — his line cooks, Rodolfo Diaz and Arsenio Fernandez, are from Ecuador and the Dominican Republic, respectively — Mr. Galeotafiore seems intent on reviving Patchogue’s reputation as a melting pot rather than a hot spot for racist division. But for the time being, safe rides home after the night shift ends are available to the staff members; Mr. Galeotafiore considers it a service he owes them.

He just wishes the courtesy was extended out of something besides his awareness of an undercurrent of fear that has nagged immigrants and their offspring since Mr. Lucero’s violent demise — Pablo pedals his bike extra fast after dark; Jose said that, as a precaution, he never ventures out alone at night.

“A lot of my staff come from countries where there is very little opportunity for them to earn a living, same as what my father went through in his time,” Mr. Galeotafiore said. “Take it from me, there’s no way to survive in this business without help from these beautiful people.”",nytimes.com,True

“We hadn’t noticed this,” Richard Dormer, the Suffolk County police commissioner, said in an interview last month when asked about the attacks by groups of young men. “And that’s a concern to us.”

Mr. Orellana is one of many Latino residents who believe that Mr. Lucero would be alive today if the police had taken crimes against them more seriously and recognized them as symptoms of a larger problem. While some Latino immigrants say they are reluctant to report crimes because they are in the country illegally or fear the police will assume they are, they and their advocates believe the police did not see a pattern because they did not want to see one.

“I told people, here the authorities are waiting for a white to kill a Hispanic or a Hispanic to kill a white,” Mr. Orellana said. “They keep attacking and robbing, and nothing changes. There had to be a death, and the death was Lucero.”

Prosecutors say the teenagers charged in the attack on Mr. Lucero chased another Latino man and shot a BB gun at a third that day. But the problems began long before Mr. Lucero’s death. And by the men’s accounts, the series of attacks involved far more teenagers.

Last month, Times reporters spoke with the 11 Latino men who gave detailed accounts of attacks they said they experienced or witnessed. The attacks the men described fit a pattern: Groups of teenagers — often, the men believed, from neighboring towns — roamed Patchogue’s grid of shops and houses and assaulted Latino men unprovoked.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The men said the groups were made up mostly of white male teenagers, but sometimes included black or Latino attackers or female onlookers.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The men’s stories could not be independently verified. Some had police complaint numbers or hospital bills; most did not.

The Times provided Suffolk County police officials with details of each account. Mr. Dormer said the police were conducting intensive investigations of several cases brought to their attention after Mr. Lucero’s death, but declined to comment on individual cases.

Immigrants say they bear some of the responsibility, because some did not report past attacks. Many fear the police because they are in the country illegally; some give false names; some do not know how the criminal justice system works or how to document their dealings with the police. Immigrant advocacy groups say the police often fuel a cycle of mistrust by inappropriately asking about immigration status; the police deny that.

But a majority of those who spoke with The Times said they or a witness called the police. Several said officers took down information and had them look at mug shots. Yet five men who reported assaults believed the police did not take the cases seriously enough. One said an officer told him he could not arrest a minor; another said the police discouraged him from filing a report; a third said he saw a victim arrested after his assailants told officers he had started the fight.

On Dec. 3, the advocacy group Hispanics Across America and the Congregational Church of Patchogue invited victims to the church to report cases to advocates and authorities, including the police, the district attorney, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department. Most of the men who spoke with The Times reporters were among those who reported their stories at the church. Mr. Orellana told his story, and the next day the police brought more mug shots to his house. This time, he identified several of his attackers.

One, he said, was Jeffrey Conroy, the well-known high school athlete charged with plunging the knife into Mr. Lucero.

Mr. Conroy’s lawyer, William Keahon, said that Mr. Conroy did not attack Mr. Orellana, adding that news media coverage may have distorted Mr. Orellana’s memory.

In early December, Commissioner Dormer ordered the department to audit thousands of police reports filed last year in the Fifth Precinct, which includes Patchogue, “to see if there was something going on that we missed,” he said.

“We’re not naïve enough to think that nothing was going on,” he added.

Even though the department has CompStat, a computerized system that helps track patterns, the police could have missed a trend if officers recorded similar incidents inconsistently, as “disturbance,” “police information” or “harassment,” Mr. Dormer said. Officers will receive new guidance on report writing, he said.

Foster Maer, senior litigation counsel for LatinoJustice P.R.L.D.E.F., a legal advocacy group, said the problem went deeper. “Something is wrong systemically,” he said.

Fernando Mateo, president of Hispanics Across America, agreed. “This was a pattern,” he said, “and the cops knew about it.”

Life on Main Street

Patchogue’s Main Street has red-brick storefronts and, around Christmas, a crèche that blares “Silent Night” loudly enough to be heard inside passing cars. Unlike other Main Streets decimated by big-box stores, the one here still functions as a town center.

One reason Main Street is still alive is foot traffic from immigrants, who have settled in the surrounding villagelike blocks. But the influx has placed Patchogue at the center of a painful debate.

Driven by immigration, Long Island’s Latino population grew 70 percent between 1990 and 2000, according to census data, and has grown faster since then, officials say.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Amid these shifts, tensions have risen, and in some cases, violence has erupted. In 2000, two men posed as contractors, abducted two Farmingville day laborers and beat them nearly to death with a crowbar. In July 2003, a group of teenagers set fire to the house of a Mexican family in Farmingville.

County Executive Steve Levy made tough policies against illegal immigration his central issue and was re-elected in 2007 with 96 percent of the vote. In 2004, he tried to deputize police officers for immigration checks but dropped the plan after a police union argued that it would make immigrants afraid to talk to the police.

Over the years, immigrants, drawn by relatively affordable housing, settled into Patchogue, a town of about 12,000 that had been mostly white. Since 2003, the Latino student population of the Patchogue-Medford School District has swelled to 24 percent from about 4 percent.

Paul V. Pontieri Jr., Patchogue’s mayor, said he believed the immigration debate painted illegal immigrants as “animals” and spurred crime by people who saw them as “expendable.” He said some residents blamed the newcomers, and the attendant costs, for austerity budgets that forced cutbacks in the high schools.

“It goes from the dining room table to the conversation at the lunchroom table — kids sitting around talking about how the senior trip they’ve been waiting for is going to be canceled,” he said. “We as the adults have to frame our conversations in a different way.”

Patchogue village officials took enough notice of menacing teenagers that last summer they adopted an ordinance allowing code enforcement officers to confiscate bicycles ridden on the sidewalk, and posted unarmed officers behind the town library, where immigrants complained they were often harassed. Mr. Dormer said the county police had made outreach efforts before Mr. Lucero’s death, holding community meetings and teaching officers basic Spanish. Yet he said no residents told the police about the scope of the problem around Main Street.

After the killing, Mr. Dormer transferred a Hispanic commander to lead the Fifth Precinct, assigned a Spanish-speaking foot patrol officer to Patchogue and named Sgt. Lola Quesada, born in Ecuador, as a community liaison. He said that the department would investigate any reports of police negligence.

Accounts of Fear

On Sept. 22, 2007, Sergio Yanza was sitting on his porch on Evergreen Street with friends when 16 to 20 people, ranging from 13 to 18 years old, poured into the street in front of the house, he said. They threw rocks and sticks — and later, logs of firewood — jumped on his car and shouted ugly things about “Spanish” people.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The youths fled before the police arrived. Hit in the head with a rock, Mr. Yanza, 38, went to the hospital for eight stitches. He never received a police report and does not know what became of the case. The police declined to comment.

Carlos Angamarca, a construction worker from Ecuador, said he and a friend were attacked in the summer of 2007 by a group of white youths who beat and kicked them. He begged a woman driving by to call the police, but she laughed. A few minutes later, he said he saw the youths get into her car and drive away.

“It’s like a hunt,” Mr. Angamarca said. The police showed him mug shots, but he recognized no one.

Last July 11, five or six boys surrounded Mauro Lopez, 45, a native of Ecuador, on a dark Patchogue street, he said. They sprayed a stinging liquid in his eyes, kicked him, bit his ear and beat him with batons or baseball bats. They stole $300, his identification, his clothes and his shoes, he said.

Later, the police drove by as Mr. Lopez crouched nearly naked on the sidewalk. The police, he said, spoke to him from the car in Spanish. But Mr. Lopez was afraid, and he told them, “No problem,” then walked home. The police, he thinks, did not notice his injuries.

The police opened an investigation after Mr. Lopez reported the attack last month. They said that he told them the car was a block away, and that they do not know whether he spoke to an officer that night.

NAME Carlos Gerardo Morales, 29. Came from Mexico about eight years ago.

DATE Late October 2008.

COMPLAINT Mr. Morales was near the Patchogue train station when four youths approached, using ethnic slurs and obscene gestures. Mr. Morales kept walking, but the boys followed him on bicycles. He ran inside the Brewery House restaurant and saw them “coming at me with belts and a chain.”

When the police came, the boys had gone. The police took a report, and said Mr. Morales could make only a disturbance charge against the boys, since they had not hit him. He paid $60 to receive a copy of the report and was told it would arrive in 30 days, but he has not received it. Officers later said that he could no longer press hate-crime charges because he did not initially report the incident as a hate crime.

They beat him unconscious, kicking him in the face and all over his body. They fled with his shoes and $20. He recognized some in the group of teenagers — who were white, black and Hispanic — as youths who often hung out on Main Street and near the library, harassing customers and store owners. Police showed him mug shots, but his eyes were swollen, and he could not see well. When he reported the attack again, after the fatal stabbing of Marcelo Lucero on Nov. 8, officers showed him more photos. He said he recognized some of the teenagers charged in Mr. Lucero’s death as being among his attackers, including Jeffrey Conroy, the main defendant.

They ripped off his clothes and took his money and identification. A police car passed about half an hour later as he sat dazed by the road, and the officers spoke to him in Spanish, but he was afraid to tell them what happened, saying, “No problem.” He walked home alone and never sought medical treatment; he still has vision problems.

He dialed 911 on his cellphone. One of the teenagers punched him in the nose so hard he later needed surgery. When the police arrived, the group had already fled. Mr. Campoverde could remember two of them clearly, though, as teenagers who often hung out on Main Street.

A few days later, Mr. Campoverde saw one of them riding down Main Street. He called the police, who stopped the teenager, but an officer told him in Spanish, “I can’t arrest him, because he’s under age.”

Mr. Angamarca had had appendix surgery a few days earlier. “Help, help, please no fight, I operation,” he recalled shouting in his rudimentary English. Mr. Angamarca got away as all four beat his friend.

A woman drove slowly by in a white car. He asked her to call the police. She laughed. As lights came at houses on the block, the youths fled. Mr. Angamarca followed and saw them get into the white car. The police had Mr. Angamarca look at mug shots, but he did not recognize anyone.

COMPLAINT In an antiques store on Main Street, a white man in his 30s or 40s cursed him with ethnic slurs saying: “You better get out of here. You don’t belong in this country.” He then grabbed Mr. Hernandez and cut his neck slightly with a knife that was on display. The shop owner called the police, who first frisked Mr. Hernandez and asked whether he was in the country legally. The shop owner told them that Mr. Hernandez was the victim. The police wrote a report, Mr. Hernandez said, but did not mention the ethnic slurs in it. They categorized the crime as criminal mischief, not a bias crime, and told him not to worry because the attacker was on drugs and would get jail time for a parole violation.

NAME Francisco Hernandez, second incident.

COMPLAINT After the killing of Mr. Lucero, Mr. Hernandez put up lawn signs urging unity. The next day he found them defaced with swastikas. The police officer who came asked Mr. Hernandez whether he was in the country legally, then told him he was provoking people with the signs. The officer put the signs in his car and, when Mr. Hernandez wanted to photograph them, said, “You can’t take pictures — it’ll be all over the news, and we don’t want that with everything that’s going on.” The officer agreed to file the case as a bias crime only after an argument.

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/nyregion/19latino.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"A civil rights legal advocacy group, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, filed an unusual international petition Thursday accusing the United States of failing to adequately protect Latinos living within its borders, regardless of citizenship.

The claim was filed with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an organ of the Organization of American States, of which the United States is a founding member. It charges that the United States is failing to live up to the group’s declaration on human rights, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man.

It cites violence against Latinos, including the murders over the past five months of three immigrants: José Sucuzhañay in Brooklyn last week, Marcelo Lucero in the Long Island town of Patchogue on Nov. 8, and Luis Ramirez in Shenandoah, Pa., on July 14. In all three cases, prosecutors say the assailants used anti-Latino slurs. Hate-crime attacks on Latinos rose 40 percent between 2003 and 2007, the petition says, citing the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The complaint also cites the rising use of agreements that allow local communities to deputize their police forces to carry out immigration law. They were created after Sept. 11, 2001, to increase cooperation between local police departments and federal immigration authorities.

The group argues that deputization leads the police to treat all Latinos as suspects of immigration violations, engenders mistrust of the police among Latinos, divides communities and promotes a belief that Latinos can be attacked with impunity. The complaint notes that such an ordinance was adopted in Shenandoah and was under consideration in Suffolk County, where Patchogue is situated.

The United States has not recognized the commission’s decisions as binding, but has sometimes responded to them in the diplomatic arena, lawyers at LatinoJustice say. In order for the petition to go forward, the commission must determine that the plaintiffs have exhausted all domestic legal remedies.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/opinion/17wed3.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"The murder of José Sucuzhañay, an Ecuadorean immigrant who died over the weekend at a hospital in Queens, has thrown a harsh light onto a savage, hate-inspired crime that should sicken us all. This horror is also a reminder that bigotry can be deadly, not just to the groups intentionally targeted, but to anyone unfortunate enough to cross its path.

José and his brother Romel appear to have been misidentified as gay as they walked home, arms around each other, on a predawn morning in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. Romel managed to escape the three men who emerged from a passing car wielding a baseball bat and shouting anti-gay and anti-Latino epithets.

José was struck on the head with a bottle, then kicked and beaten into unconsciousness. He was subsequently declared brain dead and expired last Friday night, one day before his mother, who was traveling from Ecuador, could reach him.

The victim, who had come to this country a decade ago, had been living the immigrant dream. Starting out as a waiter, he eventually bought several buildings and became co-owner of a real estate agency in Bushwick. He cared for his community and was well-liked in return.

This was the second recent killing of an Ecuadorean in the New York area. In November, Marcelo Lucero was stabbed and beaten in the Long Island village of Patchogue by a group of teenagers who, the police say, had been roaming the streets looking to beat up “a Mexican.”

Several teenagers have been arrested and charged in the Long Island case. But New York City police, who are still searching for Mr. Sucuzhañay’s killers, need to do all they can to bring those people to justice. A lynching in the heart of New York City is more than enough to remind us that bigotry cannot be tolerated.",nytimes.com,True

And there was outrage because of the assault’s setting in a neighborhood where Ecuadoreans had begun to carve out a niche.

The Sucuzhañay family — there are 12 siblings, 6 of whom live in the United States — joined thousands of their neighbors who, starting in the late 1970s, left Ecuador’s impoverished southern highlands and made New York City home to the largest community of Ecuadoreans in the country.

In later years, as border security tightened, many Ecuadoreans paid enormous sums to migrant smugglers, or coyotes, who secreted them into the country on unsteady boats, or through safe houses and across the Mexican desert.

Most immigrants settled in Corona and Jackson Heights, two neighborhoods in Queens that have long been home to concentrations of Ecuadoreans. Some spent their first nights on camas calientes — warm beds in cramped boarding houses — before the lucky ones found their own places. The No. 7 subway line carried them to jobs in Manhattan.

In 1990, there were about 76,000 Ecuadoreans in New York. Today, there are about 170,000 Ecuadoreans, the fourth-largest Hispanic group in the city after Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and Mexicans, according to census figures analyzed by demographers at Queens College. The community’s growth has been fed by a succession of economic crises in Ecuador, and by people like Jose O. Sucuzhañay, whose accomplishments seemed to signal what was possible.

His younger brother Diego said Jose “was ambitious.” After arriving from Ecuador, Jose Sucuzhañay held down a number of jobs, including one at a pizzeria. Restless, he started to invest his money and became interested in real estate. After working for another real estate firm, Jose struck out on his own. “He didn’t like bosses,” Diego said. Jose was able to put together enough money to buy buildings in Brooklyn and Queens.

At one building, on Hancock Street in Ridgewood, Queens, a tenant, Conrad Marshall, said Jose Sucuzhañay was so well known that he rarely had to list apartments; word of mouth was enough. Mr. Marshall, a banker, said Mr. Sucuzhañay was “always professional.”

His death was the second reported killing of an Ecuadorean immigrant in the New York area in a month. In November, Marcelo Lucero was attacked and stabbed by a group of teenagers in Patchogue, on Long Island, who wanted to attack a “Mexican,” the authorities have said. Mr. Lucero, like Florentino Sucuzhañay, had come from southern Ecuador in the early 1990s, to send money home.

In both cases, the attackers almost certainly did not know that their victims were from Ecuador — the men who beat Mr. Sucuzhañay called him a “Hispanic” — but that did not stop Ecuadoreans from feeling vulnerable.

Gloria Castro, who lives in Bushwick, close to where Mr. Sucuzhañay was attacked, said she did not allow her children to go out at night. There have been no arrests in the case.

The victim in that attack, Manuel Aucaquizhpi, a homeless man, was beaten to death in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, by attackers using lead pipes, chair legs and other weapons.

“Our community is growing,” he said, “and so are all the problems and success.”

There have been two or three waves of recent Ecuadorean migration to New York, according to people who study the community. Beginning in the late 1950s, middle-class immigrants came from Quito and the coastal cities of Guayaquil and Manta, said Jose Elias Rodriguez, an insurance wholesaler and the founder of the Ecuadorean World Federation.

Visas were relatively easy to get, he said, and the mostly middle-class immigrants settled in areas with established Hispanic communities, joining Colombians in Queens and Puerto Ricans and Dominicans in Brooklyn.

A second wave of immigrants, most of them undocumented and working class, started coming about 20 years later, mainly from rural towns in the southern provinces of Azuay and Cañar. Florentino Sucuzhañay, in fact, came from a small town in Cañar.

David Kyle, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Davis, said that longstanding ties between New York and Ecuador were based in part on the once-lucrative trade in Panama hats: Ecuadoreans had produced them since the 1800s, forming relationships with banks and buyers in New York.

Many southern Ecuadoreans were employed making the hats until the 1960s, when men stopped wearing them and cheaper versions in Asia undercut the business. “The people who were most hurt were rural communities involved in the basic production of hat weaving,” Professor Kyle said. “Nothing ever replaced the hats.”

The unraveling of the Ecuadorean economy and classic migration patterns that propel migrants towards people they know brought the rural southerners to New York in the 1980s.

“It was all from a handful of communities in these two provinces,” Mr. Kyle said, referring to Azuay and Cañar, as he described an intensely communal phenomenon. “All the men from one community are going, but in the neighboring town, no one is going.”

The Immigration Reform Act of 1986 put many of those immigrants on a path to legal status, which led to even more migration, Mr. Kyle said. The first wave of Ecuadorean immigrants, like Mr. Rodriguez, provided services for the next. In southern Ecuador, new houses appeared, built with money sent from New York. The houses got bigger, but as more Ecuadoreans came to New York, many of the new homes sat empty.

As border controls tightened in the 1990s, the trip to New York became more dangerous and more expensive. When Ecuador adopted the dollar as its currency a few years later — sending prices rising — a new surge of migrants headed to New York. That, combined with the heightened border security after 9/11, meant that Ecuadoreans who used to travel back and forth to their home country increasingly chose to stay in New York, Professor Kyle said.

Gloria Castro’s husband, Juan, a banana farmer, came to New York first, in 1998, paying smugglers $10,000. He flew to Panama, and then to Guatemala. From there, he traveled in a series of vehicles from one safe house to another, passed off from Ecuadorean smugglers to Mexicans. “It was barbaric, without eating for two, three days at a time, without water,” he said.

Once in New York, he saved enough money to send back for his family, borrowing some from a relative. Juan worked at a construction company, and separated trash at a recycling plant. He paid coyotes about $50,000 so the rest of his family could join him.

The family lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Bushwick. “I worked and worked and worked, and thanks to God, I brought my family,” he said.

If Queens was the beachhead for Ecuadoreans, Bushwick was regarded as something of a frontier. More than 4,000 Ecuadoreans moved there from 1990 to 2007, according to the census. Diego Sucuzhañay tried to persuade his brother not to. “I said the neighborhood wasn’t safe,” he said. “But he wanted to be useful.”

Jose was planning to make a trip back to Ecuador later this year, Diego said. Instead, on Sunday, as mourners gathered at a vigil in Bushwick in Jose’s memory, his mother made arrangements to send her son’s body back home to be buried.",nytimes.com,True

The attack occurred about 3:30 a.m. last Sunday as Mr. Sucuzhanay, 31, and his brother Romel were walking home from a bar, arms around each other, in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. Three men jumped out of a maroon or red sport utility vehicle and attacked the brothers at the corner of Bushwick Avenue and Kossuth Place, the police said.

Yelling anti-gay and anti-Hispanic slurs, one of the men broke a bottle over Mr. Sucuzhanay’s head and, when he fell to the ground, another began beating him with a baseball bat, the police said. The men kicked and punched Mr. Sucuzhanay until his brother told them that he was calling the police on his cellphone, the authorities said, and the attackers piled into the S.U.V. and drove away.

Millions of migrant workers, mostly from the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, live in Russia, which is dependent on their labor because of a rapidly declining population and a dwindling domestic work force. But violent attacks against ethnic minorities in Russia are common and have become more severe, analysts said.

This year, 85 people have been reported killed and 367 injured in attacks by nationalists, Ms. Kozhevnikova said. She said the numbers were probably far higher because many attacks were unrecorded or were reported months later. Most of the victims have been dark-skinned men from Central Asia or the Caucasus, but tourists and foreign students have also been attacked.

A foreign student who was attacked on Dec. 5, Stanley Robinson, a young African-American from Providence, R.I., on a study-abroad program to Volgograd in southern Russia, remained in critical condition after being stabbed three times on his way back from a gym, a relative said. The police are investigating whether the attack on Mr. Robinson was a hate crime.

Human rights groups have frequently criticized Russian officials for appearing to sympathize with violent nationalists and for not adequately addressing racist attacks. State-run Russian television has largely ignored the killing of the Tajik worker, though newspapers, which are typically more independent of the government, have covered it heavily.

Diego Sucuzhanay said that his brother, one of 12 siblings, came to New York 10 years ago “because there were job opportunities.” He said Jose worked as a restaurant waiter for seven years, and founded his real estate agency several years ago. “He helped this community,” he said. “He loved Bushwick.”

On Saturday night, Diego Sucuzhanay said, Jose and Romel, who had been staying with Jose, went to a party at St. Brigid’s Roman Catholic Church on Linden Street at St. Nicholas Avenue in Bushwick, a neighborhood with a large Ecuadorean community, and later had dinner at a restaurant and then drinks at La Vega, a bar at 1260 Myrtle Avenue, near Cedar Street, five blocks from the victim’s home.

In the vestibule, volunteers kept the delivery system flowing, sending a stream of potential clients to Mr. Mateo’s lawyers. “Are you a victim? Are you a victim?” said a woman passing out fliers in Spanish. The fliers explained that testimonies would be recorded, but did not explain that the person doing the recording was a reporter for the public-radio station WSHU who had done a flattering story on Mr. Wolter two days earlier.

The victims — women carrying stuffed file folders, young men in Windbreakers — were ushered into the sanctuary. Reporters were kept out. They prowled the tight space with cameras and tape recorders, descending on Latino-looking people.

The mayor of Patchogue, Paul Pontieri Jr., who grew up two blocks from where Mr. Lucero bled to death, kept a rueful watch from the edge of the circus ring. This should have been at the library, with no reporters, he told me. It’s the main gathering place for Patchogue’s growing Latino population, where English classes and other groups meet. Mr. Pontieri has spent a lot of time getting to know his Latino neighbors better and insists that they are not angry. There is confusion and sadness, he said, but the anger — like the teens accused of killing Mr. Lucero — comes from outside.

At 9 p.m., it was time for a news conference. Mr. Mateo said that he had unearthed several grim stories of victimhood and had harsh words for the county police.

Then Mr. Wolter did an odd thing. He promised reporters that tapes and transcripts of the victims’ stories would soon be released for all to hear.

I asked him whether the people who had come that night had known that their private stories of abuse were destined for mass public consumption.

It took him a while, but eventually Mr. Wolter said no, and added that he had not given it much thought. Then things got confused: Mr. Mateo told me that the tapes were meant to be turned over to the authorities. Mr. Wolter said that he was keeping the tapes himself. I waited by the radio reporter’s makeshift studio, hoping he could clear it up. Was he an audio technician, or a reporter working a story? He told me he was on deadline and angrily shut the door.

As the news conference was ending, somebody had the idea to ask a question of Joselo Lucero, who had been standing silently beside Mr. Mateo the whole time. He looked stricken with weary circles under his eyes. He looked like a hostage.

Mr. Wolter said he wanted to say a few words first, and began a speech about Joselo’s fine qualities.

Mr. Levy sees no role for himself in this drama.

“Since when is enforcing the law seen as something negative and inflammatory?” he asked his critics this week. Here is an attempt to explain.

The fixation on uprooting and expelling immigrants is negative because it doesn’t work. It’s inflammatory because it tears communities and families apart.

When you turn the local police into la migra, as Mr. Levy once tried to do, you turn immigrants into the mute prey of criminals. When you relentlessly pick fights with advocates who criticize you, as Mr. Levy has, you are unable to stand with them when disaster strikes.

And when you tolerate the poisonous notion that “illegal” is a stain that can never be erased, with no path to atonement, then you turn the undocumented into a permanent class of presumed criminals who have no rights.

The undocumented do have rights. They have the right to be paid for their labor, to speak freely and to congregate in public places without fear.

Mr. Levy has an agile mind and a commitment to doing what he sees as right. There is a way for him to make Suffolk a better place. He can give the jobs of deportation and border control back to the federal government and concentrate on making things safer and more lawful in his community. He can stand up for the rights of the undocumented, like day laborers, to congregate safely and to be paid for their work, to prevent federal crimes like wage theft and to keep off-the-books businesses from eroding pay and conditions for all workers.

He can pursue common ground with his Latino constituents — even those who are angry at him but would jump at the chance to sit down and talk. He can listen to Marcelo Lucero’s brother, Joselo, who has been a voice for peace. He can lead his county into the calm silence of reconciliation instead of silence based on fear.",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Lucero was 37 when he died and had, his friends say, been thinking of selling his Honda Accord — a modest status symbol in a community where rusty bicycles are the ubiquitous transit workhorse — and returning to Ecuador. He was homesick. Mr. Lucero, who moved here 16 years ago, missed his mother and wanted to see the house his wages had built for her.

But on Nov. 8, the seven teenagers, all from Patchogue-Medford High School but none from Patchogue Village, a longtime ethnic melting pot and of late a locus for Ecuadorean and Salvadoran immigrants, apparently made it their mission to “jump a Mexican,” according to the police. Mr. Lucero, a convenient victim, fit the bill closely enough. He tried to defend himself, the police said, but one hatemonger had a knife and chose to use it.

According to village officials, this is the first known instance of a bias murder in their village; according to Hispanic residents, it is not the first instance of biased behavior.

“These kids are coming here and harassing us more often,” said one careworn, bike-riding mourner from a neighborhood that seems less of a haven than it used to. Old enough to qualify for AARP membership, he disclosed that he is Salvadoran but refused to give his name “because the kids see me around and know who I am.”

“At night they throw rocks and bottles,” he said. “They heckle us and try to engage us; they want a fight.” Sometimes the kids do worse things. “They slashed my tires outside the library one afternoon. A lot of them carry knives. The ones who did this to Marcelo had no compassion, no morals, no nothing.”

Christopher Capobianco, a 17-year resident, called Mr. Lucero’s death “a punch in the stomach.”

“I’m a 50-year-old white guy,” he said, “and I’m angry that these little punks came into our village and attacked one of our brothers.”

At the Friday-night vigil, Joselo Lucero, his eyes puffy from tears, wore a button with a poignant message: I Am Marcelo. He had plenty of company.

More than 500 people huddled in a chilly, slanting rain on the north side of the railroad tracks where Mr. Lucero, who worked at a dry cleaner in Riverhead, was battered, stabbed in the chest and left to die.

Mr. Lucero, known around this closely knit Hispanic neighborhood as Primo — Cousin — by friends like Jose Bonilla, who runs the nearby Bravo supermarket and La Confianza cafe, had been on his way to watch a movie at a buddy’s apartment. He was, according to those who knew him, the absolute opposite of a troublemaker, but trouble certainly found him that night.

And now it is hovering over Patchogue, refusing to leave. Or maybe it was already here, and it took an act of graphic violence to bring attention to something widespread but less visible: a toxic attitude.

“It makes you think twice when you are alone locking up your store at midnight,” said Mr. Bonilla, whose grocery and cafe are two blocks from the scene. “Marcelo was the same age as me, the same skin as me, and now he is dead for doing nothing more than walking down the street in his own neighborhood.”

Mr. Bonilla was sent here at age 14 by his parents to escape gang violence in El Salvador. He worked for five years at a Brentwood pizzeria where, he recalled, the Italian owner treated him like family. He took night courses at Suffolk County Community College to learn English and became a United States citizen. He and his brother, Rogelio, have been in the grocery business in Patchogue Village for 12 years; first came a tiny convenience store for Hispanic shoppers, later the 6,000-square-foot supermarket with a wide-ranging fan base.

“The mayor’s mother shops here,” said Mr. Bonilla, alluding to Mayor Paul V. Pontieri, a champion of conciliatory policies toward the immigrant populace. Mr. Lucero patronized the grocery and bought his daily coffee at the cafe: “He’d say, ‘O.K., Primo, here’s your money, now hand over my coffee.’ ” Not anymore.

In the days following Mr. Lucero’s killing there have been umpteen community/ecumenical meetings featuring a “bridge-building” theme; a sparsely attended news conference by the Patchogue-Medford Board of Education (racism is not taught in our classrooms, was its gist); predictable statements from politicians; predictable statements rescinded by politicians. Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive with an anti-illegal immigration platform, scolded himself for initially playing down the murder as “a one-day story,” and then switched gears by condemning the accused teenagers as “white supremacists.”

Not the national recognition he, Suffolk or Patchogue sought.

“I want to think this terrible thing could have happened anywhere to anyone,” Mr. Bonilla said. He is, like most village residents, holding fast to the aberration theory. “But if anything like it happens here again, then yes, it’s time for us to do more than worry.” Already is.",nytimes.com,True

MANUEL J. SANZONE, the son and grandson of Italian immigrants and the first in his family to graduate from college, is not just the burly, protective principal at Patchogue-Medford High School, a job he has held for three years, promoted after nine years as principal of the South Ocean Middle School.

His ties are hometown ties; the high school is his alma mater. It is where he, a carpenter’s son in a working-class neighborhood, forged race-blind friendships — two of his closest allies then and now are African-American and Hispanic. It is where he returned, after graduating from St. John’s University and Dowling College, to define himself as a leader.

“Which is why,” said Mr. Sanzone, who also defines himself as the consummate people person, “I take this very personal.”

Mr. Sanzone, 45, has been consummately anguished since learning that a few of his students were under arrest and charged with a hate crime in the killing of a Hispanic man on Nov. 8. “The tongue can be a vicious tool, but I could not believe such a lack of compassion for another human being existed in our kids,” he said. He does now.

“We went from being a place we called home to a household name every home across our island, state, nation now knows and labels for our hate,” he said on Monday night at a school board meeting.

Patchogue-Medford is a school of 3,000 students, 400 of them Hispanic. And it is where the seven teenagers accused in the deadly assault on Marcelo Lucero were enrolled. One was a newcomer, but Mr. Sanzone said he knew the other six well. Or thought he did. “The only way it could possibly be worse,” he said, “would be if it had happened at school.”

To make sure no copycats tried anything like it, Mr. Sanzone mobilized a mini-lockdown: backpacks are being checked, extra security personnel are patrolling the halls, and on the Wednesday following the murder, with his school pilloried in some national media as a hotbed of anti-immigrant hostility, he spoke to his students en masse. Not to chastise them, but to thank them for bearing up.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/nyregion/20towns.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Given the polarized and angry debate in the county, it’s fair to say Mr. Levy hasn’t pulled it off. Whether anyone can do better is no small issue in American life.

“We all stand united, and speak loudly with one voice, when we say that the brutal killing of this innocent, hard-working man for no other reason than he was Hispanic is a dark and reprehensible moment for our county,” he said in his speech.

That stain, he added pointedly, is particularly shameful on Long Island, which, he said, a study has shown to be among the most segregated areas in America.

But he denied there was a link between the heated debates over immigration in the county and the crime. “Opposition to the policy of illegal immigration must never allow individuals to justify acts of violence,” he said. “Likewise, advocates for those here illegally should not disparage those opposed to the illegal immigration policy as being bigoted or intolerant.”

But, in fact, Hispanic officials and advocates for years have depicted Mr. Levy as a bullying figure, making hay out of an issue that’s popular with many white residents even though the county has very little role in enforcing immigration laws.

Phil Ramos, a state assemblyman, and Ricardo Montano, a county legislator, said Mr. Levy’s comments and policies had contributed to an atmosphere in which attacks and harassment of Hispanics are common.

“The constant rhetoric coming from some elected officials has the impact of creating an atmosphere in which a crime like this can occur,” Mr. Ramos said. “We need mature leadership in this county that doesn’t pander to the worst qualities in our residents.”

Michael D. Dawidziak, a political consultant who has worked for Mr. Levy, said he doesn’t agree with Mr. Levy on every issue, but he said it’s very hard to find any statements or policies by Mr. Levy that are beyond the norm for the immigration debate.

And Mr. Levy said that in the end, a horrible crime and his own policy prescriptions have nothing in common. “The reason so few officials will touch this issue is because it’s a lightning rod, and they can get burned and demonized very easily,” he said. “But reasonable people can disagree on the issue of illegal immigration.”

Of course, the lightning rod works both ways, and for a politician who takes pride in discerning the gut of the electorate, the issue has worked for him far more than against him, helping Mr. Levy, a Democrat, win votes in reliably Republican areas.

Critics say if he wants to change the tone, one place to start would be to find a way for victims to report crimes and for the police to aggressively register hate crimes against Hispanics. According to official figures, such crimes decreased to one in 2007 from 15 in 2004.

It takes about five minutes of speaking to immigrant workers to realize there is more than one anti-Hispanic hate crime a year in Suffolk County.

Mr. Levy said his most notorious statement, seeming to complain about the widespread news coverage the killing received, was a comment on the attention given to immigration issues in Suffolk, not an attempt to minimize the crime. In his speech, he said he needed to do better.

“Hopefully, Marcelo Lucero’s death will not be in vain. Perhaps it can be the spark for all of us — yours truly included — to admit our faults, to work more closely with one another, to pay more attention to what our children are doing, and to pay more attention to what we say,” he said. “Words do matter, and I will do all I can to help ensure that my words are as sensitive as possible toward meeting our goal to heal and to unite.”

Critics say that’s a start, but just a start.

“I’ve known Mr. Levy for many years, and I judge him on his actions, not just his words in one speech,” Mr. Montano said. “I welcome his comments, but he’ll be judged on his future words, deeds and actions, not on one speech.”",nytimes.com,True

Another officer, James Swain, held down the 6-foot-5 Ms. Johnson during the assault, which occurred on Feb. 12 after she was arrested on a prostitution charge. Ms. Johnson, who was in a booking area at the Shelby County Jail in Memphis at the time of the attack, told the authorities that Officer McRae had also hurled antigay epithets at her.

“The shock value of that video was incredible,” said Arthur E. Horne III, one of the lawyers who represented Ms. Johnson in a threatened federal civil rights lawsuit against the city, the Police Department and the officers involved in the attack.

The video was splashed across the Internet. The Memphis police director, Larry Godwin, said the crime left him “sick” and “infuriated.” Mayor Willie W. Herenton called the attack “disgusting” and promised to enforce any punishment doled out by the judicial system. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also opened an inquiry into the case to check for possible civil rights violations.

In June, the department fired Officer McRae and Officer Swain, who was a probationary officer, and asked the Tennessee Equality Project, a gay rights group, to hold training sessions for officers about sexual orientation.

Mr. Horne had offered to forgo a lawsuit if the city settled with Ms. Johnson for $1.3 million. He said her estate might still proceed with a lawsuit against the city, the department and the two officers over the beating.

“Hopefully,” Mr. Horne said, “it will open the eyes of people in Memphis, the country and the world to the challenges that transgender and gay people face due to hate crimes. The only bright side of these crimes may be that they can effectuate some change for transgender people.”

Jonathan Cole, the Shelby County chairman of the Tennessee Equality Project, praised the Police Department as embracing the problem. But Mr. Cole said that Ms. Johnson’s killing demonstrated how much discrimination remained in Memphis.

“We’re a sleepy Southern town,” he said. “For the most part, I think people in the South treat each other well. But there are prejudices that people have, and those prejudices come out in ways that are often violent when no one is looking.”",nytimes.com,True

One of them, Jeffrey Conroy, a star athlete at Patchogue-Medford High School, is accused of fatally wounding Mr. Lucero by plunging a knife into his chest. He is charged with first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime and gang assault; the others are charged with gang assault. All have pleaded not guilty.

About 500 people attended the funeral, the same number that showed up for a vigil on Friday night to honor Mr. Lucero. Children ambled down the aisles of the church and played while several ministers, including Allan B. Ramirez, the pastor of Brookville Reformed Church and a noted advocate for immigrants, read biblical passages and eulogized Mr. Lucero in both Spanish and English.

To the right of the coffin was a painted framed portrait of Mr. Lucero dressed in white centered in a green and gold halo with the Ecuadorean flag to his left and the flag of his hometown on the right. Copies of the image were printed on offering boxes at the front of the church, where mourners could donate money for the benefit of the Lucero family in Ecuador. His body is to be flown there on Tuesday for burial.

In the front pew sat Mr. Lucero’s sister, Catalina, and his brother, Joselo, who roomed with his brother. Representative Nydia M.

The pastor of the Congregational Church of Patchogue, the Rev. Dwight Lee Wolter, emphasized that while Mr. Lucero led a simple life, working at a dry cleaner’s to support his mother, another sister and a nephew back in Ecuador, his death could be a tipping point for the Patchogue-Medford community.

“Perhaps what Marcelo accomplished in death is far greater than he might have been able to do in his life,” Mr. Wolter said. “What he has done for this community since his spirit left this earth is that he can possibly be the source of healing, hope and reconciliation for a town that can reform itself.”

Mr. Levy, the Suffolk County executive, did not attend. A county legislator, Ricardo Montana, said Mayor Pontieri asked Mr. Levy not to come.

Acknowledging that he had disagreements with Mr. Levy regarding immigration policies, Mr. Montana said that the county executive’s tone in discussing immigration, particularly illegal immigration, had contributed to ethnic and racial tensions in the county.

“A Death in Patchogue” (editorial, Nov. 11) concludes by referring to “the difficult job of understanding and defending a community so vulnerable to sudden outbreaks of hostility and terror.”

There are two clear ways in which all forms of hate crimes can be better understood and communities better protected.

First, the Justice Department should take steps to increase reporting of hate crimes to the F.B.I., which at present receives no data from the thousands of law enforcement agencies that choose not to participate in the voluntary hate crime reporting program, thus limiting our understanding of the true scope of the problem.

Second, Congress should pass and the president should sign the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act to provide support and resources to help local officials protect communities from violent hate crimes, and to facilitate federal involvement when local authorities are unable or unwilling to achieve a just result.

Seven teenagers were arrested and charged in the fatal stabbing last Saturday of Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant, on a street in the Long Island village of Patchogue.

The apparent lynching caused shock and anger across the country. Politicians, religious leaders and villagers gathered Wednesday in Patchogue to console the victim’s relatives and to condemn racial hatred.

Interviews with business owners, students, government officials and immigrants in the area suggest that illegal immigration has been a wellspring for anger and tension in the neighborhood, with day laborers drawing the greatest fire. Indeed, a number of people — adults and students alike — drew sharp distinctions between assimilated immigrants, who they said should be welcomed as friends and neighbors, and newly arrived illegal immigrants, who they said do not belong.

“No disrespect here, but I’m a firm believer that if you want to come to this country, you should have a job waiting for you,” said the co-owner of the Medford Shooting Range, who gave only his first name, Charlie, and is known by the nickname Charlie Range.

He said he was offended by the behavior of some day laborers — throwing trash in the street, urinating in the bushes, hooting at passing women — and complained that illegal immigrants were crowding rental apartments and swelling the ranks of criminal gangs.

“How do you stop the illegal alien influx?” he wondered aloud. “How do you stop the rain?”

Thousands of immigrants from Latin America have flowed into Long Island in the past two decades, attracted by employment opportunities, particularly in the construction industry, which until recently was booming. Patchogue’s Latino population has risen sharply during this time, village officials say, with Ecuadoreans now being the single largest Latino group.

Anti-immigrant hostility has led to several highly publicized attacks in recent years in Suffolk County, including the near-death beating of two Mexican day laborers in 2001 and the burning of a Mexican family’s house in 2003, both in the nearby town of Farmingville.

Immigrant advocates have accused some local politicians, particularly Mr. Levy, of helping to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment by promoting tough policies against illegal immigration. But Mr. Levy said this week that the attack on Mr. Lucero “wasn’t a question of any county policy or legislation; it was a question of bad people doing horrific things.”

For all the parsing of motives and rationales in the case, many Latino immigrants here describe Suffolk County as a place where daily life can be a struggle for acceptance in a predominantly white population, particularly in this time of economic crisis. Rocio Ponce, a Brentwood resident and real-estate agent from Ecuador, said that many residents had developed a hatred against recent Latino immigrants “because they think they’re coming to take their jobs.”

Latinos say the attack against Mr. Lucero, if not his murder, was foretold. Some report being threatened and physically harassed in the streets, with bottles thrown at them and their car windows smashed during the night. Anti-immigrant epithets and racially motivated bullying are common in the hallways of the schools, children say.

“They tell us to go get a green card, ‘Go back to your community!’ ” said Pamela Guncay, 14, an Ecuadorean-American born in the United States.

Mr. Pacheco’s uncle, Jerry Dumas, said his nephew was with the group because he was looking for a ride home and would not have knowingly joined an attack against a Latino, especially considering his ethnic heritage. He also said that Mr. Pacheco’s parents had themselves been apparent victims of violent racism: When they moved into the Patchogue area in the early 1990s, Mr. Dumas said, their house was burned down twice.

Mr. Conroy was the best known of the defendants and, according to prosecutors, the leader of the group. He was on the school’s lacrosse and wrestling teams, according to his friends, and his lawyer, William J. Keahon, said he had received “a number” of offers of college athletic scholarships.

A friend who said he had been hanging out with the seven defendants in the park that night said there had not been much in the way of a plan before the group set out.

“We were just chilling, having a few beers,” said the friend, who requested anonymity because he had also been interviewed by the police and feared making contradictory statements.

Mr. Lucero had come to the United States to help support his family in Gualaceo, Ecuador, said his brother, Joselo, 34, in an interview this week in Patchogue, where he lives. Their father had died when they were young and Marcelo assumed the role of father figure in the family, Joselo said.

Marcelo Lucero was a hard worker and had little social life, according to his brother and a resident in a house where he rented a room. When Joselo joined Marcelo in Patchogue in the mid-1990s, the older brother frequently counseled him on how to take care of himself and be safe.

“He was a like a protector,” Joselo recalled. “He told me: ‘You have to be a man here. There’s no mom here anymore.’ ”

As the mob descended, Mr. Lucero’s friend managed to escape and contact the police, who rounded up the suspects minutes later.

Mr. Conroy was charged with first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime and first-degree gang assault; the others were charged with first-degree gang assault. They were arraigned on Monday and the case was sent to a grand jury, which began reviewing evidence on Thursday, according to a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney’s office.

Joselo Lucero said his priorities were now to get his brother’s body back to Ecuador for burial and to ensure that justice was served. But he said he felt no bitterness or vengefulness toward his brother’s attackers.

“I don’t really feel hate,” he said.

“I feel sorry for the families, in some way, because they have to be responsible for their kids.”

Since Mr. Lucero’s death, local officials have almost universally played down any suggestion that ethnic and racial tension had been prevalent in the community. Nonetheless, local, county and state officials have responded to the killing with various plans, including the introduction of sensitivity task forces, outreach programs in the Latino community and community forums.

“It is imperative that we bridge the divide,” Patchogue’s mayor, Paul V. Pontieri Jr., said on Thursday, “and realize that the things we have in common far outnumber those that divide us.”",nytimes.com,True

He was beaten and stabbed. The friend who crouched beside him in a parking lot as he lay dying, soaked in blood, said Mr. Lucero, who was 37, had come to the United States 16 years ago from Ecuador.

The police arrested seven teenage boys, who they said had driven into the village from out of town looking for Latinos to beat up. The police said the mob cornered Mr. Lucero and another man, who escaped and later identified the suspects to the police. A prosecutor at the arraignment on Monday quoted the young men as having said: “Let’s go find some Mexicans.” They have pleaded not guilty.

The county executive, Steve Levy, quickly issued a news release denouncing this latest apparent hate crime in Suffolk County. That should be the first and least of the actions he and other leaders take.

A possible lynching in a New York suburb should be more than enough to force this country to acknowledge the bitter chill that has overcome Latinos in these days of rage against illegal immigration.

The atmosphere began to darken when Republican politicians decided a few years ago to exploit immigration as a wedge issue. They drafted harsh legislation to criminalize the undocumented. They cheered as vigilantes streamed to the border to confront the concocted crisis of Spanish-speaking workers sneaking in to steal jobs and spread diseases. Cable personalities and radio talk-show hosts latched on to the issue. Years of effort in Congress to assemble a responsible overhaul of the immigration system failed repeatedly. Its opponents wanted only to demonize and punish the Latino workers on which the country had come to depend.

A campaign of raids and deportations, led by federal agents with help from state and local posses, has become so pervasive that nearly 1 in 10 Latinos, including citizens and legal immigrants, have told of being stopped and asked about their immigration status, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Now that the economy is in free fall, the possibility of scapegoating is deepening Hispanic anxiety.

It is not yet clear how closely connected Mr. Lucero’s murder is to this broad wave of xenophobia.

But they said they had seen no evidence that Mr. McClelland’s slaying was racially motivated. And they said the three men had been friends for years.

“This is a group of guys who had black friends and white friends,” said Allan Hubbard, a spokesman for the Lamar County district attorney’s office. “Any comparison to Jasper and James Byrd is preposterous.”

Set in the 1970s and ’80s in the industrial north, “Once Upon a Time in England” covers 13 years in the lives of the Fitzgeralds, a mixed-race family, part English, part Malaysian, torn apart by its internal dynamics as well as the realities of a working-­class world beset by racism, rampant alcohol and drug abuse, and economic stagnation. In telling her story, Walsh sometimes verges on melodrama, but she writes the local dialect with a native speaker’s fluency, and her vibrant language digs deep into her characters’ emotional and social terrain.

Robbie Fitzgerald is a factory worker who dreams of making it big as a lounge singer in the kinds of places that smell of “stew and malt and slough from the factories and the dead sweat of nicotine dripping from the ceiling.” His wife, Susheela (she Anglicizes her name to Sheila in an effort to assimilate), has come from Kuala Lumpur to work as a nurse, and then to raise the couple’s two children, Vincent and Ellie. Sheila has severed most of her ties to her native country, but the skinheads who patrol the Fitzgeralds’ housing estate won’t let her forget them; on a night when Robbie is about to get his first big break, Sheila becomes the victim of racial violence. The destructive ramifications of the attack are magnified when she chooses not to tell her husband everything that has happened.

In an effort to make his shellshocked wife happier, Robbie moves the family to the middle-­class suburbs. There Sheila tries her best to erase her old self, but Robbie, humiliated by all he cannot provide, takes more seriously to drink and then to other women. Gradually, he loses hold of his music and his dreams, and finally his family.

Once in their teens, Robbie and Sheila’s children struggle with the tensions of their parents’ marriage and the racism of the society around them. Ellie, the more willingly loved by her father, manages to fit in, but as Robbie fades from her life she loses herself in drugs. Vincent, an effeminate, bookish boy, must weather his father’s homophobia and the bullying of his classmates. He turns inward, reinventing himself as a punk poet and later as a heroin addict, and his bid for the love of an adored young man has tragic consequences.",nytimes.com,True

For Mr. Kaufman and his colleagues, returning to Laramie, a town of 25,000 near the Colorado border, is far from a theatrical exercise. They plan to use the new interviews to write an epilogue to the play before the 10th anniversary of Mr. Shepard’s death, on Oct. 12; it will be added to the published version of the script and will be included in future performances of “The Laramie Project,” which has had about 2,000 productions since it opened off Broadway in 2000.

On a personal level, too, the artists arrived here with a palpable yearning to find change in Laramie, its people and its attitudes toward gay people. (The troupe allowed a reporter to sit in on the interviews.)

“We’ve had some degree of apprehension about coming back to Laramie,” said Mr. Kaufman, who is also the author of the 1997 Off Broadway hit “Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde.” “There had been such fervor about how Matthew Shepard’s death would make a difference. There are hundreds of hate crimes each year, but Matthew is the one that resonated nationally. But what if nothing has really changed?”

Mr. Kaufman does not hide his feelings easily. After an interview this weekend with Laramie’s mayor, Klaus Hanson, Mr. Kaufman shook with anger that Mr. Hanson was not doing anything to commemorate the anniversary. (“Now that you have touched upon it,” the mayor said, “I will need to rethink it.”) Mr. Kaufman’s expressed dismay that there is no hate-crimes law in Wyoming, as he thinks there should be. He and others also said that some in Laramie were no longer speaking of Mr. Shepard’s death as a hate crime but rather as a drug-fueled robbery gone wrong.

“A lot of people in the community went through a sense of grief, in a very poignant, heartfelt, painful way, and I think eventually the pain became so great that they don’t want to think about it or hear about it,” Rebecca Hilliker, a professor of theater at the University of Wyoming here, told Mr. Kaufman over the weekend. “After I got over the emotional trauma, the nightmares, I myself had to say, ‘O.K., step back, think about this — what you can and can’t do — and stop placing the burden of changing the state on yourself.’ ”

Mr. Kaufman conceded, “People get exhausted.”

“You get exhausted,” Ms. Hilliker nodded, sitting by windows in her home on a breathtaking open plain. “And then you can’t plan anymore how to fix things.”

Laramie has changed in some ways. The city council passed a bias crimes ordinance that tracks such crimes, though it does not include penalties for them. There is an AIDS Walk now. Several residents say they came out publicly as gay, in their churches or on campus, in part to honor Mr. Shepard’s memory. The university hosts a four-day Shepard Symposium for Social Justice each spring, and there is talk of creating a degree minor in gay and lesbian studies.

And yet, to the bewilderment of some people here, there is no memorial to Mr. Shepard in Laramie. The log fence has been torn down where he lay dying for 18 hours on Oct. 7, 1998. There is no marker. Wild grass blows in the wind.

The Fireside bar — where Mr. Shepard was lured away by Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, who are serving life terms for murder — is also gone, sold and renamed years ago. Without the Fireside, there is no longer a bar in town where gays, jocks, foreign students and cowboys mix together.

Mr. Mickelson, wearing a weathered white cowboy hat and a university sweater sporting a large W, said he lost almost everything because of the infamy of the Shepard murder. He ended up moving from the place he loved to look for work elsewhere.

“I got it from both sides: ‘the Fireside was a gay bar,’ ‘the Fireside had gay slayers,’ ” Mr. Mickelson said over beers at a dance hall here, the Saloon. “The media gave our whole town a black eye. They gave our whole state a black eye. They gave the university a black eye. It was hate crime, hate crime, hate crime.”

If Laramie has struggled with this onus, young gay men here have also reckoned with the fact that Mr. Shepard’s death did not change much for them. Nor, they say, did the success of the 2005 movie “Brokeback Mountain,” about two gay ranch hands in Wyoming.

“If you walk around campus holding hands with another guy, you have to know that people are going to holler and yell at you,” Iain-Peter Duggan, a junior at the University of Wyoming, and who is gay, said in an interview. “You just have to be smart.”

Another gay undergraduate, Christopher, who did not want his last name published because he is not out to his family or many friends and former teammates, said he was torn about the legacy of Mr. Shepard: He loves Laramie and Wyoming very much, but he also said he was “disappointed” that he cannot openly date another man here without facing hassles.

“Online chatting is a big deal for gay guys in Wyoming — that’s pretty much the only place to be safe,” Christopher said.

After Sunday dinner at the home of Catherine Connolly, a lesbian professor at the university who is a memorable character in “The Laramie Project,” she and Mr. Kaufman affectionately sparred in the kitchen about his frustration that this town had not become a place transformed.

“You know, Moisés, how much has really changed in Manhattan in the last 10 years?” Ms. Connolly said, referring to ongoing hate crimes and the lack of a gay marriage law in New York. “It’s unfair to hold Laramie to a standard that you don’t hold yourself to.”

According to the Colorado Anti-Violence Program, there were 121 incidents of violence committed against gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people in Colorado last year, numbers that have held relatively steady over the past few years.

In 2007, however, there was a 24 percent increase nationally in the number of victims reporting such violence, said Avy Skolnik, coordinator of statewide and national programs for the National Anti-Violence Project in New York City.

The case is part of a string of events that have recently stirred tensions among black and Jewish residents in Crown Heights. Others episodes have included an assault on a black college student and an attack on an Orthodox Jewish teenager.

In 1991, clashes erupted in Crown Heights after a Jewish driver hit and killed a 7-year-old black boy. In the ensuing chaos, a 29-year-old Hasidic scholar was fatally stabbed.",nytimes.com,True

A letter announcing the decision, sent Monday to the faculty of the college, indicated why the punishment had escalated. “During the months since the college levied sanctions against her, Professor Constantine continued to make accusations of plagiarism, including in at least one instance to the press, against those whose works she had plagiarized,” the letter stated.

Indeed, Dr. Constantine’s lawyer continued to point out during an interview on Monday that the three people who accused her of plagiarism were themselves promised indemnity.

The original sanction against Dr. Constantine was never made public, but the letter was clear that the college now wanted her gone.

Immediately after the findings were announced this winter, Dr. Constantine derided them as “biased and flawed.”

This month, a faculty committee found her appeal baseless and dismissed it.

The case attracted more attention than it might have because even as Dr. Constantine was being investigated on the plagiarism charges, a noose was found hanging from her office door.

There is a continuing criminal investigation into who placed the noose on the door, but there have been no charges in the case. When she was first found guilty of plagiarism, Dr. Constantine linked the two events.

“I believe that nothing that has happened to me this year is coincidental, particularly when I reflect upon the hate crime I experienced last semester involving a noose on my office door,” she said in February in an e-mail message to faculty and students. “As one of only two tenured black women full professors at Teachers College, it pains me to conclude that I have been specifically and systematically targeted.”

There were about 600 violent racist attacks, including 80 murders, reported in Russia in 2007, according to the Sova center, an organization that monitors hate crimes in Russia. The number of attacks this year reached 232 as of June 1, 57 of which were murders.

Human rights groups have often accused officials of ignoring the problem of racist violence in Russia, though, in Moscow at least, a recent spike in murders of dark-skinned people has prompted a noticeable response among law enforcement agencies.

“Moscow prosecutors have definitely started to more actively engage this problem, beginning from last year,” said Aleksandr Verkhovsky, the director of the Sova center.

The Interior Ministry announced last week that the police had arrested more than 50 people this year who were thought to be involved in xenophobic attacks in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the cities with the highest levels of racist violence.

Still, the number of attacks nationwide continues to grow steadily by about 15 to 20 percent each year, as it has for about the last five years, Mr. Verkhovsky said. Moreover, he said, the percentage of murders is growing as teenagers involved in violent nationalist groups grow into adults.

The title was fitting: The United States, in its treatment of hate speech, as in so many other areas of the law, takes a distinctive legal path.

“In much of the developed world, one uses racial epithets at one’s legal peril, one displays Nazi regalia and the other trappings of ethnic hatred at significant legal risk, and one urges discrimination against religious minorities under threat of fine or imprisonment,” Frederick Schauer, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, wrote in a recent essay called “The Exceptional First Amendment.”

“But in the United States,” Professor Schauer continued, “all such speech remains constitutionally protected.”

Canada, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, South Africa, Australia and India all have laws or have signed international conventions banning hate speech. Israel and France forbid the sale of Nazi items like swastikas and flags. It is a crime to deny the Holocaust in Canada, Germany and France.

Six years later, a state court judge in New York dismissed a libel case brought by several Puerto Rican groups against a business executive who had called food stamps “basically a Puerto Rican program.” The First Amendment, Justice Eve M. Preminger wrote, does not allow even false statements about racial or ethnic groups to be suppressed or punished just because they may increase “the general level of prejudice.”

Some prominent legal scholars say the United States should reconsider its position on hate speech.

“It is not clear to me that the Europeans are mistaken,” Jeremy Waldron, a legal philosopher, wrote in The New York Review of Books last month, “when they say that a liberal democracy must take affirmative responsibility for protecting the atmosphere of mutual respect against certain forms of vicious attack.”

Professor Waldron was reviewing “Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of the First Amendment” by Anthony Lewis, the former New York Times columnist. Mr. Lewis has been critical of efforts to use the law to limit hate speech.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But even Mr. Lewis, a liberal, wrote in his book that he was inclined to relax some of the most stringent First Amendment protections “in an age when words have inspired acts of mass murder and terrorism.” In particular, he called for a re-examination of the Supreme Court’s insistence that there is only one justification for making incitement a criminal offense: the likelihood of imminent violence.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The imminence requirement sets a high hurdle. Mere advocacy of violence, terrorism or the overthrow of the government is not enough; the words must be meant to and be likely to produce violence or lawlessness right away. A fiery speech urging an angry mob to immediately assault a black man in its midst probably qualifies as incitement under the First Amendment. A magazine article — or any publication — intended to stir up racial hatred surely does not.

Mr. Lewis wrote that there was “genuinely dangerous” speech that did not meet the imminence requirement.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“I think we should be able to punish speech that urges terrorist violence to an audience, some of whose members are ready to act on the urging,” Mr. Lewis wrote. “That is imminence enough.”

Harvey A. Silverglate, a civil liberties lawyer in Cambridge, Mass., disagreed. “When times are tough,” he said, “there seems to be a tendency to say there is too much freedom.”

“Free speech matters because it works,” Mr. Silverglate continued. Scrutiny and debate are more effective ways of combating hate speech than censorship, he said, and all the more so in the post-Sept. 11 era.

“The world didn’t suffer because too many people read ‘Mein Kampf,’ ” Mr. Silverglate said. “Sending Hitler on a speaking tour of the United States would have been quite a good idea.”

Mr. Silverglate seemed to be echoing the words of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., whose 1919 dissent in Abrams v. United States eventually formed the basis for modern First Amendment law.

“The best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,” Justice Holmes wrote.

“I think that we should be eternally vigilant,” he added, “against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death.”

The First Amendment is not, of course, absolute. The Supreme Court has said that the government may ban fighting words or threats. Punishments may be enhanced for violent crimes prompted by racial hatred. And private institutions, including universities and employers, are not subject to the First Amendment, which restricts only government activities.

But merely saying hateful things about minorities, even with the intent to cause their members distress and to generate contempt and loathing, is protected by the First Amendment.

In 1969, for instance, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the conviction of a leader of a Ku Klux Klan group under an Ohio statute that banned the advocacy of terrorism. The Klan leader, Clarence Brandenburg, had urged his followers at a rally to “send the Jews back to Israel,” to “bury” blacks, though he did not call them that, and to consider “revengeance” against politicians and judges who were unsympathetic to whites.

Only Klan members and journalists were present. Because Mr. Brandenburg’s words fell short of calling for immediate violence in a setting where such violence was likely, the Supreme Court ruled that he could not be prosecuted for incitement.

In his opening statement in the Canadian magazine case, a lawyer representing the Muslim plaintiffs aggrieved by the Maclean’s article pleaded with a three-member panel of the tribunal to declare that the article subjected his clients to “hatred and ridicule” and to force the magazine to publish a response.

“You are the only thing between racist, hateful, contemptuous Islamophobic and irresponsible journalism, and law-abiding Canadian citizens,” the lawyer, Faisal Joseph, told the tribunal.

In response, the lawyer for Maclean’s, Roger D. McConchie, all but called the proceeding a sham.

“Innocent intent is not a defense,” Mr. McConchie said in a bitter criticism of the British Columbia law on hate speech. “Nor is truth. Nor is fair comment on true facts. Publication in the public interest and for the public benefit is not a defense. Opinion expressed in good faith is not a defense. Responsible journalism is not a defense.”

Jason Gratl, a lawyer for the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Association of Journalists, which have intervened in the case in support of the magazine, was measured in his criticism of the law.

“Canadians do not have a cast-iron stomach for offensive speech,” Mr. Gratl said in a telephone interview. “We don’t subscribe to a marketplace of ideas. Americans as a whole are more tough-minded and more prepared for verbal combat.”

Many foreign courts have respectfully considered the American approach — and then rejected it.

A 1990 decision from the Canadian Supreme Court, for instance, upheld the criminal conviction of James Keegstra for “unlawfully promoting hatred against an identifiable group by communicating anti-Semitic statements.” Mr. Keegstra, a teacher, had told his students that Jews were “money loving,” “power hungry” and “treacherous.”

Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Brian Dickson said there was an issue “crucial to the disposition of this appeal: the relationship between Canadian and American approaches to the constitutional protection of free expression, most notably in the realm of hate propaganda.”

Chief Justice Dickson said “there is much to be learned from First Amendment jurisprudence.” But he concluded that “the international commitment to eradicate hate propaganda and, most importantly, the special role given equality and multiculturalism in the Canadian Constitution necessitate a departure from the view, reasonably prevalent in America at present, that the suppression of hate propaganda is incompatible with the guarantee of free expression.”

The United States’ distinctive approach to free speech, legal scholars say, has many causes. It is partly rooted in an individualistic view of the world. Fear of allowing the government to decide what speech is acceptable plays a role. So does history.

“It would be really hard to criticize Israel, Austria, Germany and South Africa, given their histories,” for laws banning hate speech, Professor Schauer said in an interview.

In Canada, however, laws banning hate speech seem to stem from a desire to promote societal harmony. While the Ontario Human Rights Commission dismissed a complaint against Maclean’s, it still condemned the article.

“In Canada, the right to freedom of expression is not absolute, nor should it be,” the commission’s statement said. “By portraying Muslims as all sharing the same negative characteristics, including being a threat to ‘the West,’ this explicit expression of Islamophobia further perpetuates and promotes prejudice toward Muslims and others.”

A separate federal complaint against Maclean’s is pending.

Mr. Steyn, the author of the article, said the Canadian proceedings had illustrated some important distinctions. “The problem with so-called hate speech laws is that they’re not about facts,” he said in a telephone interview. “They’re about feelings.”

“What we’re learning here is really the bedrock difference between the United States and the countries that are in a broad sense its legal cousins,” Mr. Steyn added. “Western governments are becoming increasingly comfortable with the regulation of opinion.

The man, David A. Tuason, 46, of Pepper Pike, Ohio, began sending letters 20 years ago and sent his last threat, by e-mail, to the singer Al Jarreau in February.

''That's a long time to hold a grudge,'' said Frank Figliuzzi, special agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s Cleveland field office.

Mr. Tuason, an Asian of Filipino descent, sent letters and e-mail threatening Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court; the actor Taye Diggs; and Jason Taylor, the Miami Dolphins defensive lineman.

''If this doesn't stop the blackie will be castrated, shot, or set on fire,'' Mr. Tuason wrote to Justice Thomas in 2003, according to the indictment. ''I will blow up the Supreme Court building.''

Mr. Tuason's ire was not reserved for the prominent either. When he saw what he perceived to be an interracial couple in a restaurant, in a mall or walking down a street, he would stalk the pair and send threatening letters to their homes and businesses, Mr. Figliuzzi said. If he could not find out where they lived, he would include the license plate number of the couple's car and mail a letter to the local police or the Ohio Department of Highway Patrol.

Mr. Tuason was discovered after he began sending messages by e-mail in January of this year. Although he logged on to the Internet anonymously from public libraries near his home, the F.B.I. tracked him using surveillance cameras and descriptions from library employees, said Dean M. Valore, an assistant United States attorney.

The United States, at war in Iraq, was vilified in many Muslim countries. At first, the violence wrought by Mr. Haq, whose family is Muslim and has roots in Pakistan, seemed a stunning local eruption of that overseas tension. Jewish groups here invested in new security measures and formed new alliances.

Yet as Mr. Haq’s trial began this week, few people were talking about domestic terrorism; there was no gathering of protesters outside the courthouse.

Prosecutors say Mr. Haq, a stocky man in a sweater vest who often keeps his head down at the defense table, is a political extremist who acted deliberately. But they also say that he is mentally ill, and that he acted alone. Citing his longstanding mental health issues, they are not seeking the death penalty.

The King County prosecutor at the time of the attack, Norm Maleng, described it as “one of the most serious crimes that has ever occurred in this city.” When Mr. Maleng decided not to pursue the death penalty, he met with Jewish leaders to explain his decision.

The day before the shooting, Mr. Haq, 32, an engineering graduate who lived in the Tri-Cities area of Eastern Washington, had used the Internet to find the Jewish Federation and its offices, near downtown Seattle. When he showed up there the next afternoon, he was able to enter the locked front door by holding a gun to the back of a teenage girl who was on her way in to meet a relative, an employee who was later shot.

A few minutes later, after Mr. Haq had finished his shooting spree, he demanded, without success, that the 911 operator connect him to CNN. Instead, he followed the operator’s instructions to walk outside, drop his gun and lie face down on the sidewalk, where he was arrested.

Mr. Haq has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. His lawyers argue that he suffers from bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses and that he was insane at the time of the attack, in part because his medication had been changed.

If a jury decides Mr. Haq was mentally stable and deliberately planned his crime, he could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. Many Jewish leaders and some shooting victims have said they agree with the prosecution’s decision not to press for the death penalty. The Jewish Federation has resumed fund-raising and has expanded its mission to include more community organizing and education about Jewish issues.

Rabbi Moshe Kletenik of Bikur Cholim-Machzikay Hadath, an Orthodox congregation that is the oldest Jewish congregation in Seattle, said that while the trial was deeply painful for the federation’s employees and volunteers, in general Jews in the region could be “confident that we live in an overall safe and very wonderful society.”

Robert Jacobs, the regional director for Stand With Us, a group that advocates in support of Israel, said that in the wake of the shooting many Jewish groups made a point of improving security. Most synagogues, he said, now hire security guards for major services. Yet Mr. Jacobs said that more than once he had noticed a back door left propped open even in a building with a sophisticated new entry system.

The Jewish Federation here has spent nearly $1.5 million, much of it state money, to redesign and improve security at its offices. The stairway where the director of annual giving, Pam Waechter, was shot to death is gone. Narrow hallways have been transformed into light-filled open spaces with center cubicles.

“I’m really hopeful other people will come forward now,” she said. “When the initial charges were made, there were many students involved who didn’t feel they could follow up. They were too scared, and they were afraid of retribution.”

Dr. Yeh said that some of her work that had been copied concerned “indigenous healing,” or alternative methods, like acupuncture and Santeria, of dealing with medical and spiritual ailments. She said she has specialized in that subject for years.

Mr. Giacomo said that he and his client met with lawyers from Hughes Hubbard in August and that Dr. Constantine was confronted with 36 passages from her work, and similar passages from the work of others, mostly Dr. Yeh’s. He said Dr. Constantine had subsequently submitted documentation showing that the passages were her own “original work,” and “related back to prior works she had done.”

“We thought that was the end of story; we thought there was no way that they could overlook the documentation that we had presented,” he said.

In October, a noose was found on Dr. Constantine’s office door, prompting the police investigation and student protests at Teachers College, which cherishes its image as a bastion of multiculturalism. In January, Mr. Giacomo said, the college’s president and provost told Dr. Constantine that the investigation into her writings had concluded that she had used the works of others without attribution, but that if she agreed to resign, the report would not be publicized.

Mr. Giacomo said that despite objections and further documentation, the college did not change its position. He said he now considered it “not a stretch of the imagination” to suspect the noose was “an additional way of intimidating my client.”

When told of these comments, Ms. Horowitz, the spokeswoman for the college, said, “Accusations that the college had anything to do with hanging the noose are totally absurd and totally untrue.”

Dr. Luthar said that any suggestion that the inquiry was about race was “misguided and wrongheaded at best,” noting that she herself is “a woman of color,” as is Dr. Yeh.

The college, in its statement, said that Hughes Hubbard had “concluded that Professor Constantine’s explanation for the strikingly similar language was not credible.”

Johnson, a Brooklyn Surrogate’s Court judge, the authorities said Saturday.

Judge Johnson, a former State Supreme Court justice, was elected in November as the first black Surrogate’s Court judge in Kings County. Surrogate’s Court hears cases involving the probate of wills, the administration of estates and adoptions.

The police said that members of Judge Johnson’s staff discovered the graffiti on Thursday. No arrests have been made.

Marking property with graffiti is normally a misdemeanor, punishable by a year or less in jail, but is prosecuted as a hate crime with a more severe sentence when racial epithets are used. The authorities said the graffiti at the Surrogate’s Court, 2 Johnson Street, contained pejorative and racially charged language.

Judge Johnson’s election last year came after a hotly contested Democratic primary in which she defeated another black candidate, ShawnDya L. Simpson, a Civil Court judge and a former Brooklyn assistant district attorney. In a heavily Democratic borough, victors in primary races for judgeships are all but certain to win general elections, as Judge Johnson did in November.

But the race provoked tensions, since the Brooklyn Democratic organization and its leader, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, endorsed Judge Simpson. Several black leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, backed Judge Johnson, who won the party’s nomination with 60 percent of the vote. Surrogate’s Courts in Brooklyn and other boroughs have long been known as sources of patronage, funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to lawyers who serve as guardians in thousands of estate cases.",nytimes.com,True

The only grounds for expulsion would be if he were a threat to others or had a psychiatric illness, she said.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Many doctors, students and officials argued that Mr. Svensson should never get a license because of the trust needed in medicine; others said he had served his time and should be permitted to stay and become a doctor.

On Thursday, after considering the case for months, the Karolinska expelled Mr. Svensson on a technical issue: Mr. Svensson had apparently falsified the name on his high school transcripts.

In re-examining his application forms recently, an institute official noticed that Mr. Svensson’s high school transcript, dated 1995, was under his current surname, Svensson, not what is believed to be his family name, Hellekant. Mr. Svensson changed his name after being convicted of the crime.

“That seemed strange to us, so on Wednesday we asked the national agency responsible for verifying application documents to check,” and they could not verify the transcript, Dr. Wallberg-Henriksson said in a telephone interview on Thursday. “We were under the assumption that they had done it because that’s their responsibility.”

Mr. Svensson offered no protest when another Karolinska official notified him of his expulsion, she said.

Mr. Svensson did not respond to numerous attempts to reach him for this article.

In 2000, Mr. Svensson, then Mr. Hellekant, was convicted of shooting a trade union worker, Bjorn Soderberg, 41, seven times after a loud argument outside Mr. Soderberg’s apartment in a Stockholm suburb on the night of Oct. 12, 1999. Mr. Soderberg had complained about a co-worker who displayed his neo-Nazi beliefs at work, leading to the co-worker’s loss of a job and union position. The co-worker was a friend of Mr. Svensson’s.

At the time of the killing, according to court records and Stockholm police officials, Mr. Svensson was under surveillance for neo-Nazi activities by the Swedish Security Service, the equivalent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Despite the conviction, Mr. Svensson maintained that he did not commit the killing.

After serving 6 1/2 years of an 11-year sentence, Mr. Svensson was released on parole in February 2007. According to Swedish prison standards, inmates are usually released after serving two-thirds of their sentence.

While imprisoned, Mr. Svensson took a number of online courses that met the Karolinska’s high standards. Two admissions committee members interviewed him separately, Dr. Wallberg-Henriksson said. One was a psychiatrist. But neither interviewer detected anything unusual or asked him to explain his activities during the previous six-and-a-half-year period, she said.

She notified Mr. Svensson’s classmates by intranet on Thursday of the decision to expel him. On Friday she said she would address the students, her third meeting with the student body concerning Mr. Svensson’s case.

Dr. Wallberg-Henriksson first met with students last fall to tell them that a convicted murderer was a classmate.

She met with students again when Mr. Svensson identified himself before his classmates. At that meeting, Mr. Svensson spoke for about 10 minutes without apologizing for the murder or his past. He did say, “Today, I am not the person I was 10 years ago,” Dr. Wallberg-Henriksson said.

After Mr. Svensson spoke at that session, Dr. Wallberg-Henriksson said, she discussed the case with his classmates. One group vehemently expressed the view that he deserved to study medicine because he had served his time. But others disagreed, saying they were scared and felt unsafe having him as a classmate.

The proportion of supporters and critics among the speakers was about even, she said, but many who seemed neutral asked for more information.

Dr. Wallberg-Henriksson said that she offered Mr. Svensson and his classmates consultations with faculty members, including psychologists, and that many responded.

Linnea Zetterman, a medical student at Umea University who went through the same 45-minute interview process in applying to Karolinska, said it seemed strange that the interviewers did not question him about the six-and-a-half-year period.

The interviews were “rigid and made you wonder whether you were suited for the profession,” she said.

A number of doctors, writing in a number of recent issues of Lakartidningen, a journal published by the Swedish Medical Association, have argued that Mr. Svensson should not be allowed to become a doctor.

Also, the Swedish licensing body, which has no authority over medical schools, has said it will not grant Mr. Svensson a medical license if he graduates because of the conviction. That view left Karolinska officials in a quandary over whether and how to tell Mr. Svensson’s patients about his past.

When Dr. Wallberg-Henriksson appealed to the Swedish government to resolve the issue, she said she received mixed signals.

At one point, 20 detectives were assigned to investigate the case, and though they zeroed in on a suspect almost from the start, there was not enough evidence to charge him.

According to a police official, Mr. Ivanov said his acts of vandalism were a result of “bad judgment” and “rage.”

In addition to the charges of weapons possession, Mr. Ivanov was arraigned on four charges of criminal mischief and five charges of aggravated assault. Two counts of each charge are considered hate crimes.

Adrian Lesher, a lawyer appointed to represent Mr. Ivanov, said at the arraignment that his client “basically led police to the apartment in a situation that was almost calculated.” The judge, John Wilson, set bail at $150,000 cash or a $300,000 bond, and ordered Mr. Ivanov to surrender his passport.

Mr. Lesher declined to answer questions after the arraignment, but did say, “I can tell you he’s Jewish.” He would not comment further.

Upon hearing that Mr. Ivanov was said to be Jewish, Aaron L. Raskin, the rabbi of Congregation B’Nai Avraham, one of the desecrated synagogues, was skeptical.

“Is his mother Jewish or is his father Jewish?” the rabbi asked, adding that to be “biblically Jewish,” Mr. Ivanov would have to have a Jewish mother.

“If he is Jewish, then he really needs to see a rabbi,” Rabbi Raskin said. Still, he said that he would ask his congregants to pray for Mr. Ivanov “to strengthen the unity of the neighborhood.”

The relationship between Mr. Ivanov and the owner of his apartment at 58 Remsen Street, Michael C. Clatts, remained unclear on Monday. Mr. Clatts, 50, could not be located, and some who have worked with him said they had no idea who Mr. Ivanov was.

Mr. Clatts’s colleagues at the National Development and Research Institutes, a nonprofit group based in Manhattan, were disbelieving that he could have any connection with wrongdoing. The police said they did not know of any link between Mr. Clatts and Mr. Ivanov’s weapons.

“This does not fit with my knowledge of him,” Don C. Des Jarlais, a research fellow at the agency, said of Mr. Clatts. “He’s an anthropologist.”

The police had also not reached Mr. Clatts as of Monday night. He directs the organization’s Institute for International Research on Youth at Risk and is believed to be traveling, one official said. He could be in Puerto Rico, where he is a university professor, or in Vietnam, where he is conducting research on H.I.V. risk among young intravenous drug users, according to a colleague.

Much less is known about Mr. Ivanov. In court, his lawyer said that Mr. Ivanov is a linguist. The authorities are not sure of his age, saying he is either 37 or 31 years old. Mr. Ivanov told the police that he was born in Sicily and raised in Bulgaria, and that he had been trained by Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad. He has been arrested in the past on charges that included petty larceny, according to the police, but the disposition of those cases was not available. It was not clear how long he had been living at 58 Remsen Street, but neighbors said they recalled seeing him more than they saw Mr. Clatts.

Roberta Weisbrod, who lives in the building next door, said Mr. Ivanov “was always around walking the dog, all the time.”

Detectives had questioned Mr. Ivanov before about the September vandalism and had visited the apartment several times, the police said. They even obtained his signature, a sample of his handwriting, but were unable to link him conclusively to the crimes.

During those visits, the most dangerous thing they found in the apartment was a paintball gun, the police official said.

On Sunday, about 1 a.m., Mr. Ivanov approached police officers on patrol and told them that someone had shot him in the hand. But when investigators visited the place where Mr. Ivanov said he had been shot, they were unable to find blood or anyone who had witnessed a shooting. Someone also called the police from Long Island College Hospital, where Mr. Ivanov had been taken for treatment, and told them that he had been wearing a bulletproof vest. Investigators later concluded that the gun probably went off while Mr. Ivanov was cleaning it.

The police said they then decided to search his apartment, and what they found was alarming: bloody rags and towels everywhere, and weapons, mostly in the kitchen and living room. The arsenal included seven pipe bombs and two pounds of what the police called a “low-explosive powder”; a sawed-off shotgun and a crossbow with arrows; another pipe bomb, hidden in a foam football; and other rifles, including pellet guns. The discovery prompted an all-day evacuation of the building.

Detectives were not sure on Monday what Mr. Ivanov planned to do with the weapons.

According to a law enforcement official, detectives are exploring the possibility that Mr. Ivanov had planned to use the pipe bombs against synagogues. The official said that Mr. Ivanov told investigators he intended to use the bombs for fishing; but, given his admission that he painted swastikas on synagogues, investigators became concerned he was planning violence. Detectives have seized his computers, and are searching them for clues, the official said.

Residents and religious leaders in Brooklyn Heights expressed relief at the announcement that there had been an arrest in connection with the vandalism.

After a swastika appeared on the steps outside Congregation B’Nai Avraham, within sight of the building where Mr. Ivanov lived, the congregation hired a security guard and installed high-resolution surveillance cameras, Rabbi Raskin said.

Re “Caving In on Hate Crimes” (editorial, Dec. 10):

As the House author of the hate crimes bill, I share your disappointment that the landmark hate crimes legislation that passed the House earlier this year as a stand-alone bill will not be included in the Department of Defense Authorization bill.

But I want to clarify that neither the House nor Speaker Nancy Pelosi “caved” in trying to move this extremely important bill to the president’s desk.

The House, in fact, passed the legislation as a stand-alone bill on May 3 and worked furiously with Senate negotiators to reach a compromise that was agreeable for both sides to have it included in the authorization bill.

Under Democratic leadership, the House was able to move this legislation further than it’s ever been before.

The fight for better enforcement and more resources to fight hate crimes does not end here. I remain personally committed and optimistic that Congress will pass this legislation and put it on the president’s desk within the next Congressional session.

This time, the House leadership has failed to find a way to get a bipartisan law against hate crimes passed and signed into law. Racial, religious, sexual and other minorities have waited long enough. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has to do more than just express her support for the bill; she must find a way to make it the law.

The Matthew Shepard Act would expand the definition of hate crimes and make important improvements in the federal response. To categories already covered by federal law, which include race and religion, it would add crimes committed because of the victim’s sexual orientation, gender identity, gender or disability. It would also broaden the federal government’s authority to investigate these hateful acts.

The bill has been a top priority of civil rights groups since Mr. Shepard, who was gay, was beaten to death in Laramie, Wyo., in 1998. It also has strong support from law enforcement, including the National Sheriffs’ Association and the National District Attorneys Association. The House passed it 237-180, with significant Republican support, and the Senate passed a similar bill by voice vote, after a 60-39 cloture vote.

President Bush has suggested he would veto the bill. It’s an unfortunate threat, but one he is certainly capable of carrying out. House and Senate leaders planned to get around that threat by attaching it to a Department of Defense Authorization bill, which Mr. Bush would have had trouble vetoing. But House leaders decided last week that since some liberals did not want to vote for the defense bill and some conservatives did not want to vote for the hate crimes bill, they could not piece together a majority to get it through.

The noose remains a terrifying symbol, and continues to be used by racists to intimidate African-Americans (who made up more than 70 percent of lynching victims).

In the past decade or so, only about a dozen noose incidents a year came to the attention of civil rights groups. But since the huge Sept. 20 rally in Jena, La., where tens of thousands protested what they saw as racism in the prosecution of six black youths known as the “Jena 6,” this country has seen a rash of as many as 50 to 60 noose incidents. Last Tuesday, for example, a city employee in Slidell, La., was fired after being accused of hanging a noose at a job site a few days earlier.

These incidents are worrying, but even more so is the social reality they reflect. The level of hate crimes in the United States is astoundingly high — more than 190,000 incidents per year, according to a 2005 Department of Justice study.

And the number of hate groups, according to the annual count by the Southern Poverty Law Center, has shot up 40 percent in recent years, from 602 groups in 2000 to 844 in 2006.

It seems that the September rally in Jena — much as it was seen by many civil rights activists as the beginning of a new social movement — signaled not a renewed march toward racial and social justice, but a surprisingly broad and deep white backlash against the gains of black America.

The beating is being treated as a bias attack, at least the second in recent weeks in Lakewood.

The boy told officers he was on a street about 6:30 p.m. when a group of six or seven youths approached him from behind, punched him in the head, knocked him to the ground and shouted “Jew” along with another word he could not make out, said Sgt. Maureen McGilloway of the Lakewood police. He was treated for cuts and bruises at a local hospital.

Sandy, 29, a designer from Williamsburg, was lured from his home to a secluded lot in Sheepshead Bay on Oct. 8, 2006. He was directed to a beach known as a meeting place for gay sex, then beaten and chased into traffic. He was struck by a car and later died of his injuries.

From Mr. Sandy’s computer, the police recovered online messages sent through a Web site for gay men. Prosecutors accused four men of hate crimes, a distinction that can extend prison sentences.

In pretrial hearings, defense lawyers argued that no evidence showed that the defendants harbored any real animosity toward homosexuals. Prosecutors countered that the defendants had selected Mr. Sandy as a robbery target believing a gay man would offer little resistance and hesitate to report the crime.

Justice Jill Konviser-Levine, who had helped draft the state hate crime law as a senior assistant counsel to Gov. George E. Pataki, allowed the charges to stand. She rejected a defense argument that the law was unconstitutionally vague.

“The statute provides clear standards for enforcement,” she wrote, “in that it does not permit a hate crime to be charged merely because a victim happens to possess a trait protected by the statute.”

One defendant, Gary Timmins, 17, pleaded guilty to attempted robbery as a hate crime and accepted a sentence of four years in exchange for testifying against his friends. Two others, Anthony Fortunato, 21, and John Fox, 20, were accused of selecting Mr. Sandy as a robbery target. They were convicted of manslaughter and attempted robbery as hate crimes last month in a joint trial before separate juries. They are scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 20.

During that trial, Mr. Fortunato testified that he, too, was gay, calling witnesses to corroborate the details of his sex life. Lawyers for both men argued that they had merely planned to swindle Mr. Sandy, not to forcibly rob him, a required element of the felony murder charges.

Justice Konviser-Levine will have broad discretion at their sentencing. Manslaughter as a hate crime carries a minimum penalty of 1 to 3 years and a maximum of 8 1/3 to 25, according to prosecutors.

Of the four defendants, only Mr. Shurov was accused of physical violence. In the first trial, witnesses said he had hidden behind a dune, run out, thrown punches, chased Mr. Sandy in front of a moving car on the Belt Parkway and then rifled his pockets.

Mr. Shurov’s trial was to begin yesterday, but after a series of last-minute negotiations that led to the plea deal, Mr. Shurov arrived in the courtroom, stocky, crew-cut and handcuffed, just before 5 p.m.

Mr. Shurov raised his hand, swore an oath and, with a series of yeses, entered his guilty plea. His family quickly left the building, leaving his lawyer to explain the plea.

The authorities say the accused, three men and three women, including a mother and her son and a mother and her daughter, held the woman, 20, captive for days at a trailer. The authorities say the six sexually assaulted the woman, beat her and forced her to eat feces.

The victim told police that her attackers had yelled racial epithets.

“Hate crimes are out of control in America,” Malik Shabazz, a legal adviser to the woman and a founder of Black Lawyers for Justice, said at the rally. “Nooses are being hung, and our women are being raped by white moms.”

“What happened,” he said, “was a hate crime, and we want this prosecuted as a hate crime.”

Mr. Shabazz staged the rally despite a request by the city’s black ministerial association and the N.A.A.C.P. not to hold it for fear it would harm the prosecution’s case.

Brian Abraham, the Logan County prosecutor, has not filed hate-crime charges in the case, saying the charges filed carried harsher penalties.

The Canarsie episode was at least the eighth time in the past few weeks that a noose was discovered in the New York area. In one instance, a noose was placed on the doorknob of the office of a black professor at Columbia University’s Teachers College.

The noose mailed to Canarsie High was made from a three-foot-long, half-inch-thick piece of cotton — something that might have been used to tie back curtains.

“It goes without saying that this is a horrific thing to have happen, and we are going to make sure we cooperate with police,” said Dina Paul Parks, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Education.

Ms. Washington, 44, who was previously the principal of Middle School 390 in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, could not be reached for comment last night, but Ms. Parks said she had stayed at the school throughout the day.

On Wednesday, two were found at a sanitation garage in the Town of Hempstead — one of them looped around the neck of a stuffed animal with its face blackened. On Thursday, a noose was discovered hanging in a Nassau County highway department yard in Baldwin. On Friday, a worker at the Green Acres shopping mall in Valley Stream found one slung over a door at a construction site.

Public officials said they were outraged, determined to catch the culprits — and stumped.

“It would diminish the seriousness of these events to call any of them copycat situations,” said Kate Murray, the supervisor of the Town of Hempstead, a sprawling township of 750,000 residents, about 15 percent of them black, where all of last week’s incidents occurred. “But I’m not a sociologist. I am surprised by it.”

Elected officials called press conferences. They ordered training classes on racial sensitivity for employees. (A few in the “copycat” camp pointed to the Jena Six case in Louisiana, in which six black youths were arrested last year and accused of beating a white youth who they thought was involved in hanging nooses from a tree at Jena High School. The tree was a “whites-only” preserve.)

“I don’t know what the pattern is, if there is one,” said Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive of Nassau County, which includes Hempstead. “Are people more hateful than they have been? I just don’t know.”

Like many other parts of the country, Long Island is not without a history of racial bigotry. Black people were barred from buying homes in Levittown until well into the 1960s. Some Long Island school districts are still among the most segregated in the country. The black population is about 12 percent of the total, but is highly concentrated in a half-dozen communities that are 95 percent minority. In 2004, in Suffolk County, it was still possible for an interracial couple to wake up in the night to find a cross burning on their lawn — it happened in a hamlet called Lake Grove.

Lynching was not part of that history. But to some of those sifting the evidence, the nooses of 2007 represent much the same impulse as lynchings did in the Jim Crow South.

“In the context of today, the noose means, ‘There is still a racial hierarchy in this country, and you better not overstep your bounds,’” said Carmen Van Kerckhove, the founder of a New York consulting firm, New Demographic, that specializes in workplace problems, including racial tension.

The most clear-cut example of that, perhaps, was the first episode in the cluster. The noose appeared the morning of Sept. 28 in the locker room of the Hempstead Village Police Department. Taped to the wall near the rope was a newspaper clipping referring to Deputy Chief Willie Dixon, the 57-year-old department veteran who was promoted to the rank in May. Chief Dixon, who is black, told investigators he had received anonymous letters containing racial epithets upon his promotion and felt sure the noose was intended for him.

Frederick K. Brewington, a Hempstead lawyer who has represented dozens of workers claiming racial discrimination in their jobs on Long Island, said competition over promotions is often a source of racially charged conflict. “The reality is that African-Americans are vying for positions in the work force in greater numbers, and I think there is a backlash — a cowardly backlash — from people who do not want more competition for the limited number of jobs,” Mr. Brewington said.

Willie Warren, an equipment operator at the Nassau County Public Works yard here, was among three workers in the garage on Thursday when an employee ran in to tell them he had found a noose hanging from a fence outside. Mr. Warren, 41, who has been with the department for 20 years, filed a racial discrimination suit in 2004, producing tape recordings of a supervisor referring to him with racial epithets. He won the case, got a promotion, still works for one of the supervisors named in his suit, and considers himself unflappable on the job.

The noose shook him. “It’s hard to explain, but it made me upset the whole day,” Mr. Warren said. One white co-worker was as upset as he was, he said. Another said, “What’s the big deal? It’s only a noose.”

Rachel E. Sullivan, an assistant professor of sociology at Long Island University’s C. W. Post College, said most people do not understand what lynchings were. “They think it was a few guys coming in the night, in their hooded sheets, taking you away,” she said.

She teaches a course on African-American history, including the killings of thousands by lynching in the United States between the end of the Civil War and the end of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

“But in reality these were whole, big community events,” she said. “Children and families would come to watch. Hundreds of people attended. They would watch a man being burned and mutilated before he was hung. They would pose for pictures with the body.

“If people had a grasp of what really happened at these things,” Professor Sullivan continued, “they would understand the power of the symbol of a noose.”

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/nyregion/20hate.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Prosecutors on Staten Island decided yesterday not to charge two white men with a hate crime after they were arrested in connection with an attack on a black man on Tuesday night.

The men, Daniel Avissato, 24, and Mark Vincent Maleto, 21, were arraigned instead on charges of second-degree gang assault, according to Daniel M. Donovan Jr., the Richmond County district attorney.

The police had charged the men with assault as a hate crime when they were arrested Thursday. Mr. Donovan did not elaborate on why prosecutors did not proceed with hate crime charges, but a statement he released suggested there was no evidence that the men selected the beating victim, Skylar McCormick, 20, because of his race.

“At this point, I believe the evidence provided to my office by the police is legally insufficient to support hate crime charges,” Mr. Donovan said. “Our investigation is ongoing, and as our efforts move forward I am not excluding the possibility of presenting to a grand jury evidence in support of an indictment under the hate crimes statute.”

The men would face up to 15 years if convicted of the present charges. If charged with a hate crime, they could face up to 25.

Investigators said Mr. McCormick had been with a group of friends, and stopped in front of a driveway on Wright Avenue to lean on a Cadillac.

About 15 minutes later, as Mr. McCormick and his friends were walking down a nearby street, the police said, a silver Cadillac stopped in front of them.

The police said that on Tuesday at about 8 p.m., Mr. McCormick was with four friends, white men and women, when he and one of the others decided to have a foot race down the street. The race ended near a silver Cadillac parked in front of a driveway on Wright Avenue.

The police gave this account of what happened next: Mr. McCormick and his friend waited for the others to catch up, and Mr. McCormick sat on the fender of the Cadillac to catch his breath. He then leaned against the windshield on the driver’s side.

After the group was reunited, they all walked down the street.

About 15 minutes later, at the intersection of Simonson Avenue and Heusden Street, a silver Cadillac, which had come racing down the street, screeched to a halt in front of them. Inside the car were five white men.

Mr. Avissato, the driver, got out of the car and confronted Mr. McCormick while yelling racial epithets, the police and witnesses said.

Referring to the verdict, he added, “I’m never going to feel good about myself for it.”

Prosecutors brought hate crime charges — a distinction that can lengthen sentences — on the theory that the defendants had selected Mr. Sandy for robbery, believing that a gay man would offer little resistance. They said Mr. Fortunato had contacted Mr. Sandy through a Web site for gay men and had used instant messages to persuade him to meet.

A second defendant, Gary Timmins, 17, pleaded guilty to attempted robbery as a hate crime and testified for the state at Mr. Fortunato’s trial. A third, Ilya Shurov, 21, the only one accused of striking Mr. Sandy, is next to be tried.

A fourth, John Fox, 20, was tried alongside Mr. Fortunato in the same courtroom but with a separate jury, and was convicted of manslaughter and attempted robbery as hate crimes last week.

In the course of deliberations, a series of notes from the jury made it clear that many of the jurors sharply disagreed with the foreman on applying the law.

Mr. Fortunato faces a minimum sentence of 1 to 3 years in prison and a maximum of 8 1/3 to 25 years.

“I don’t think Anthony had any malice or bad intention,” Mr. Zaccar said, adding that he had agreed to the verdict because other jurors insisted “that he was negligent, that he was reckless.”

A police spokesman, Paul J. Browne, said yesterday that there were still no suspects.

College officials and the Police Department sparred publicly yesterday over the department’s request that Teachers College turn over hours of video from a number of security cameras. But college officials said there was no camera in the hallway by Dr. Constantine’s office.

In a separate case, the president of Columbia University, Lee C. Bollinger, reported that an “anti-Semitic smear” had been found yesterday in a bathroom in a campus building, Lewisohn Hall. The police said a swastika and a caricature of a man wearing a yarmulke had been drawn in black ink on a stall door.

In the noose case, Mr. Browne said yesterday that the police were “disappointed and surprised” that Teachers College had refused to turn over its security camera footage without a subpoena. “It is always important to get information as soon as possible,” he said. “You don’t want to give the perp time to concoct a story or cover their tracks.”

She said that the college was committed to cooperating with the police and that by the time the police arrived with the subpoena early yesterday evening, the college had already downloaded the video to hand over to officers.

“There’s been open communication all along with the Police Department,” she said.

As for Dr. Constantine, Dr. Fuhrman said she had heard “nothing but accolades” from her students. “She’s well respected in her field,” she said. “Probably her work engenders passionate debate, but I could name 100 other people here who you can say the same thing about.”

In the interview, Dr. Constantine described growing up in Lafayette, La., the third of five children. Her father works as a bartender at a private club for people in the petroleum industry; her mother was a teacher’s aide working with special education students.

Her parents, who attended college but did not graduate, saved their money to send their children to Catholic schools.

“Your scholarship is evaluated differently,” she said. “People think that I and other black scholars are studying issues of race because we’re black and because it’s personal. But if I’m studying racism, that’s not about me, right, that’s often about white people, who have certain types of attitudes about people of color, and so forth.”

No detailed complaint has been filed in the case, and Dr. Constantine, who was accompanied during the interview by her lawyer, Paul J. Giacomo Jr., declined to elaborate on the case.

One key concept in Dr. Constantine’s scholarship is “racial microaggression,” which she explained as the often subtle ways in which racial differences can plague relationships between even well-meaning therapists and their clients, or supervisors and their trainees. For Dr. Constantine, colorblindness is neither possible nor desired.

“We have some of the most well-meaning, well-intentioned students I have ever met, and I really enjoy working with them,” she said. “Well-meaning and well-intentioned doesn’t mean effective.” Proclaiming oneself to be colorblind, she added, “is not a helpful perspective in counseling and therapy.”

Does Dr. Constantine think her work could be connected to the noose, hardly a microaggression, but, in her words, “a very, very aggressive act?”

“I haven’t ruled it out that it’s connected,” she said. “I teach courses on racial and cultural issues.” She added, “There are things that I say that have pushed people’s buttons, because it challenges the status quo.”

For now, Dr. Constantine says she is done with the interviews and ready to return to her private life. She was eager to attend her boyfriend’s daughter’s wedding this weekend, she told friends she encountered in the hallway.

For Columbia students, the incident had particular resonance coming so soon after demonstrations against the Jena Six case in Louisiana, in which white students hung nooses outside a high school and were not prosecuted. A white student was later beaten and six black students were initially charged with attempted murder; thousands have protested the case.

Columbia was also the site recently of demonstrations against Jim Gilchrist, a founder of the Minuteman Project, a group opposed to illegal immigration, and an appearance by the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, that left students divided over the boundaries of free speech.

Professor Derald Wing Sue, who has collaborated with Professor Constantine on such work as a book called “Addressing Racism,” said, “That’s her area of expertise, so in some sense I think it’s personally devastating and upsetting to her.”

“It could be a discontented student, it could be conflicts with colleagues, it could be the type of work that Professor Constantine does on racism that pushes buttons,” he said. “Teachers College is very devoted to a social justice agenda, but it’s a microcosm of a larger society when issues of race and racism are discussed.”

Dr. Fuhrman said yesterday that she would work to retain and recruit more minority faculty members, and offer students more scholarships.

The victim, Michael J. Sandy, 29, of Williamsburg, was lured to a secluded lot in Sheepshead Bay on Oct. 8, 2006, through online messages at a Web site for gay men.

From there, he was led to a narrow beach by the Dead Horse Inlet, then attacked and chased into traffic on the Belt Parkway. He was struck by a sport utility vehicle and later died of his injuries. The driver has never been identified.

Prosecutors charged Mr. Fox, Mr. Fortunato and a third man, Ilya Shurov, 21, with murder as a hate crime, a distinction that can extend sentences. By the prosecution’s theory, the men had selected Mr. Sandy for robbery because they believed that a gay man would put up little resistance and would hesitate to report the crime.

Before the trial began, defense lawyers asked to dismiss the charges, arguing that the men had shown no hatred for homosexuals. The judge overseeing the case, Jill Konviser-Levine, rejected that argument.

A fourth young man, Gary Timmins, 17, pleaded guilty to attempted robbery as a hate crime and testified for the prosecution. Mr. Shurov, the only one accused of striking Mr. Sandy, will be tried separately.

A lawyer for Mr. Fortunato, who is being tried alongside Mr. Fox, has argued that Mr. Fortunato himself is gay and was unlikely to select gay men as targets. In a note to the judge, the jurors in the Fortunato case said tensions were rising.

By the account of prosecutors, Mr. Fox played a role in every aspect of the crime. He supplied the computer screen name used to exchange messages with Mr. Sandy.

He met Mr. Sandy alone, prosecutors said, guiding him to the place where the others lay in hiding. And he was one of the two men identified by witnesses as chasing Mr. Sandy onto the highway.

During the trial, which began on Sept. 17, a lawyer for Mr. Fox, John D. Patten, attacked the credibility of the police and Mr. Timmins. But he built much of his defense on the legal definition of robbery.

By Mr. Patten’s account, the defendants had intended to swindle Mr. Sandy for marijuana, not to rob him by force. The most serious charge in the indictment, felony murder as a hate crime, required the element of attempted robbery.

Squinting through low-hung glasses, speaking with a light brogue and quoting from the Book of Daniel, Mr. Patten argued that the case lacked integrity. Mr. Fox, a sophomore at SUNY Maritime College at the time of his arrest, was taken from his dormitory room in the middle of the night, Mr. Patten said, and interrogated by detectives who did not read him his rights until he began making incriminating statements.

He told jurors that Mr. Timmins had described a plan merely to steal from Mr. Sandy, drawing a contrast to the use of force.

“Ripping someone off doesn’t mean much,” Mr. Patten argued. “I get ripped off when I go to Yankee Stadium and pay $10 for a beer.”

Mr. Sandy’s death, he argued, was caused by Mr. Shurov and by the driver, “this coward who’s out there probably reading all the newspaper articles on this case, who hit Mr. Sandy and killed him and then took off.”

An assistant Brooklyn district attorney, Anna-Sigga Nicolazzi, argued that the plan fit the definition of robbery, citing transcripts of the online messages.

“You can almost hear the grand old time they’re having as they type away,” Ms. Nicolazzi said. She added, “They were going to surround Mr. Sandy, scare him and take his money.”

The Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, made no comment on the jury’s application of the hate crime law, but Christine C. Quinn, the first openly lesbian City Council speaker, said, “Today a Brooklyn jury sent a powerful message that hate crimes of any stripe have no place here in New York City.”

As for the victim’s parents, they said they were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.

“Things like this shouldn’t happen,” said Mr. Sandy’s father, Ezekial Sandy. “Hopefully something greater will come out of it.”

Outside the courthouse yesterday, the jury foreman, Jason Linetsky, 29, said the hate crime charges were the source of some debate.

“We needed clarification of: how much do we bring of our own personal feelings?” Mr. Linetsky said.

On a more basic level, the jury’s verdict included apparent contradictions, endorsing the elements of causing a death in the course of a robbery but rejecting the felony murder charges. Asked about that, Mr. Linetsky posed his own question: “Were we about to send somebody to life when he wasn’t the direct cause of it?”

Without the element of a hate crime, manslaughter is a Class C nonviolent felony carrying a minimum penalty of 1 to 3 years and a maximum of 5 to 15. As a hate crime, the charge is a Class B violent felony carrying a sentence of 5 to 15 years, according to the district attorney’s office.

Mr. Fortunato has chosen to testify in his own defense. On Monday, he told jurors that he himself was gay, possibly, or at least deeply confused about his sexual orientation. He described luring the gay man as a tentative step toward revealing his own sexuality to his friends.

Jurors have already had a look at two of those friends, Mr. Fox and the cooperating witness, Gary Timmins, a burly teenager who wears his clothes baggy and his attitude prominently.

At the time of the attacks, Mr. Fortunato was a college freshman with some real-world experience, working at a relative’s law firm. Under questioning from his lawyer on Monday, he presented himself as a latter-day Meursault of Sheepshead Bay, seeking the pleasures of sex and drugs in a fog of confusion.

Mr. Fortunato testified that since age 13, he had hidden homosexual impulses and eventually encounters from his friends. Luring Mr. Sandy, he said, was intended to gauge their opinions of homosexuality.

“I might someday be able to reveal to a heterosexual group of friends that I was gay,” Mr. Fortunato said, adding, “I was living two complete double lives.”

Two more witnesses gave similar accounts.

A neighborhood friend of Mr. Fortunato, Donna Donovan, 18, described his mood the day after Mr. Sandy was struck by the car. “He was quiet, very shaken up a bit, very down,” she testified.

The defendant’s mother, Joan Fortunato, testified about his movements in the house on the night in question, before and after Mr. Sandy was hit. As she sat on the witness stand, her son gave her a half-wave, then a half-smile, then dropped his head.

Existing law applies protection to victims only of crimes based on race, color, religion or national origin and just in cases when the victim was engaged in certain protected activities like attending public school or serving on a jury. Existing law also provides stiffer sentences for federal crimes classified as hate crimes.

The new measure, promoted by Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, removes the activities requirement while adding federal protection for gay, transgender and disabled victims.

The proposal is named for Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student who was tied to a fence, beaten and left to die in 1998.

From the witness stand, Mr. Timmins described sitting around Mr. Fortunato’s house that night, discussing a displeasing marijuana shortage. Mr. Fortunato, he said, devised a remedy.

“He started talking on the computer; he went to the gay chat site,” Mr. Timmins testified.

When Mr. Sandy offered marijuana, “Anthony got all excited, because that’s basically what we wanted.”

The men met Mr. Sandy at Plumb Beach, he said. They scared him off the first time, but he agreed to come back. This time, Mr. Fox planned to get into Mr. Sandy’s car alone while the others hid. Mr. Timmins said he gave Mr. Fox last-minute advice.

“I told him, ‘Just don’t let him touch you or none of that,’ ” Mr. Timmins said.

The three other men were charged with murder as a hate crime, a distinction that can draw a longer sentence. They also were charged with felony murder, a count requiring prosecutors to prove that the killing took place during a robbery.

In their opening statements, defense lawyers argued that no robbery had taken place.

“He’s innocent of these charges,” said John D. Patten, a lawyer for Mr. Fox. “John Fox, as he sits here today, is not a murderer, has never been a murderer and never will be a murderer.”

Rather than a robbery, Mr. Patten argued, the luring of Mr. Sandy was better described as the crime of larceny by trick. The defendants intended to invite Mr. Sandy to smoke marijuana, ask for money to buy the drugs, then leave. The violent attack by Mr. Shurov, he said, was not anticipated by the other defendants.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Unlike robbery, larceny by trick is not an element of felony murder. The notion of a robbery, Mr. Patten said, was concocted after the fact by the prosecutors and investigators.

Mr. Fortunato’s lawyer made much the same argument, adding a twist by declaring his client’s homosexuality. Outside the courtroom, he sought to explain his theory, to a certain extent.

Mr. Fortunato, he said, might have planned to smoke marijuana with Mr. Sandy as a means of testing his friends’ sentiments about homosexuality. Or, he said, perhaps Mr. Fortunato had wanted to swindle a gay man, to see how his friends reacted to a gay person. Or, he said, perhaps Mr. Fortunato had simply wanted to rob somebody.

The video then shows two terrified dark-skinned men kneeling in the forest under a Nazi flag. Each speaks through a gag in accented Russian, saying only, “We were arrested by National-Socialists.” One has been bound with heavy tape, the other with rope.

Chechen separatists have been accused of beheading captured Russian soldiers since the first Chechen war, which began in 1994, and recordings of such grisly acts have circulated in markets in the Caucasus for years. Three British citizens and a New Zealander working for a British telecommunications company were abducted in Chechnya and beheaded in 1998 after being forced to confess on video to spying.

But Mr. Verkhovsky said the latest video was new ground for Russian ultranationalists and neo-Nazis, and perhaps a “symmetrical reaction to Chechnya.”",nytimes.com,True

The judge, Jill Konviser of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, said in a written order that prosecutors need show only that the victim was chosen because of his sexual orientation to pursue charges under the state’s Hate Crimes Act of 2000. The law provides for longer sentences on conviction for crimes motivated by racial, religious and other characteristics of a victim.

The case concerns the killing of Michael Sandy, 29, a gay man who was lured to a meeting place in Sheepshead Bay last October, then driven a short distance to Plumb Beach, where he was beaten and chased into traffic on the Belt Parkway. He later died of his injuries.

The defendants, John Fox, Anthony Fortunato and Ilya Shurov, none older than 21, were charged with murder as a hate crime.

Can you have a hate crime without hate?

Yes, the Brooklyn district attorney says. But to a lawyer for three men charged with murder, that is “absurd.” It is up to a state judge in Brooklyn to decide who is right.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The case is rooted in the death of Michael J. Sandy, 29, last October. According to the charges, the three men used an Internet chat room to lure Mr. Sandy to a secluded area in Sheepshead Bay known as a gay trysting spot. They were in search of money and drugs, it is charged, and thought that a gay man would be an easy target, unlikely to put up much resistance or to report the crime.

The charges say that they beat Mr. Sandy, but that he broke free and ran onto the nearby Belt Parkway, where he was hit by a car. Five days later, he died.

The defendants are accused not only of murder but also of murder as a hate crime. It is the hate-crime charge that their lawyer, Gerald J. Di Chiara, wants tossed out. They bore no ill will against gays, Mr. Di Chiara says. “The crimes alleged are not crimes of hate but rather crimes of opportunity,” he wrote the judge, Justice Jill Konviser-Levine of State Supreme Court.

The distinction that Mr. Di Chiara makes is significant, some would say. Not Brooklyn prosecutors, however. They acknowledge that there is no evidence of “an animus toward gay men” by the defendants. But blatant hatred is not required under the 2000 law, they say. If it were, the law would have explicitly said so.

What it says instead is that a person commits a hate crime when he makes someone a target “in whole or in substantial part because of a belief or perception regarding the race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation of a person.” The prosecutors say that the three men picked on Mr. Sandy precisely “because of a belief or perception” about him — namely that a gay man would make a soft target.

The statute’s language, they told the judge, is “unambiguous.”

WOULD that life were so simple.

The law also says that “proof of race, color, national origin” and all the rest “does not, by itself, constitute legally sufficient evidence” to substantiate a hate crime charge. More is presumably needed. Like what? Mr. Di Chiara cited a State Senate memorandum from 2000 that spoke of limiting prosecutions to “only those who are truly motivated by invidious hatred.”

Invidious hatred? Not on the part of his clients, the lawyer said. They were just looking for easy pickings.

Under the prosecution’s interpretation, he said, hate crime charges could be brought against a mugger who attacks an old woman in the belief that she will offer little resistance. Or against a burglar who goes after an illegal immigrant figuring that the victim won’t go to the police.

One might also conclude, Mr. Di Chiara said, that “all sex crimes are hate crimes because the victims were chosen ‘because of’ their sex.” Yet you do not see rapists routinely prosecuted as hate criminals.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In court documents, a defense lawyer has asked Justice Konviser-Levine to dismiss the enhanced murder charges against all three defendants because “the crimes alleged are not crimes of hate but rather crimes of opportunity.”

That lawyer, Gerald J. Di Chiara, filed a motion in which he argued that lawmakers responsible for the Hate Crimes Act had written a statute applicable only to defendants who truly hate their victims. He quoted from a State Senate memorandum in support of a law “designed to ensure that only those who truly are motivated by invidious hatred are prosecuted for committing hate crimes.”

To allow prosecutors to pursue hate crime charges without demonstrating such hatred, Mr. Di Chiara argued, would render the law unconstitutionally vague and arbitrary.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

For example, he wrote, the authorities could then ascribe hate crimes to “a mugger who selects an elderly or disabled person because he believes that such a victim will be unable to resist effectively, a pocketbook snatcher who targets women, or a burglar who selects a victim from an ethnic minority group because the victim does not speak English.”

In response, prosecutors filed a response drafted by Seth M. Lieberman, senior appellate counsel to the Brooklyn district attorney. Around the courthouse, Mr. Lieberman, a quiet, cerebral man, is most often found sitting in silence beside his colleagues, taking notes on constitutional issues.

In his response, Mr. Lieberman began with an end run around the defense motion: He conceded that the grand jury had seen no evidence of hatred for gay men, but argued that Justice Konviser-Levine had approved the indictment, thus implicitly rejecting the same defense arguments.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In addition, he argued, if lawmakers had intended to make prosecutors prove defendants hated their victims, the Legislature would have said so in the law’s final language.

“By contrast with New York State,” Mr. Lieberman wrote, “other states have hate crime statutes that require evidence of bias, animus or prejudice.”

Citing legal scholars, he suggested that hate crime prosecutions without evidence of hatred could benefit society. As in the era of racially motivated lynching, he noted, prosecutors could alter perceptions of vulnerability among certain groups and impunity among others.

At the hearing yesterday, friends and relatives of Mr. Sandy’s sat opposite supporters of the defendants. All paid rapt attention as Justice Konviser-Levine probed the merits of the motion. In its intellectual exercise, the hearing departed from the usual tenor of the courthouse, a place more fertile for high dudgeon, emotional drama and accidental comedy.

In his oral argument, Mr. Lieberman said the hate crime law was meant to address a deep social problem.

Justice Konviser-Levine, who is due to rule in August, asked him whether he meant the law was “nothing more than rhetoric?”

To the contrary, Mr. Lieberman argued, the law was valid and fit these defendants because “they chose to go to a gay Web site, and there was a particular remark made by one of the defendants that this was an easy way to rob people.”

Re ''Film's View of Islam Stirs Anger on Campuses'' (Arts pages, Feb. 26):

Your article suggests that some feel that our documentary about the threat of radical Islam could ''spur hate crimes against Muslim students.'' We reject this notion.

To date, ''Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West'' has been seen by millions of people around the world, and there has not been one reported incident of violent backlash as a result.

On the contrary, the film has received acclaim and commendation from leaders, critics and military experts alike, who have found it to be fair and accurate in its presentation.

Rather than furthering vital dialogue, the Muslim Students' Association is strangling the debate by exerting pressure to shut down our screenings altogether.

The association purports to be a moderate Muslim group. If so, why is it defending the radicals so vociferously?

One of the jurors, Harry Donas, 45, an engineer, said after yesterday’s verdict that the jury thought there were other reasons besides delusions to explain Mr. Johnson’s behavior. Among them, Mr. Donas said, were that his female companion had died of AIDS, that he planned it two months earlier, and that he was losing his business.

Attempted murder normally brings a sentence of up to 25 years in prison. But prosecutors said yesterday that Mr. Johnson faced a potentially longer sentence, depending on his prior record, because attempted murder as a hate crime is considered a more serious offense than attempted murder.

Mr. Johnson has a criminal record for weapons and drug arrests going back to 1985. He showed no reaction to the verdict yesterday. Sentencing was scheduled for later this month.

On the night of the shooting, Mr. Johnson — armed with a samurai sword, three pistols, kerosene and plastic handcuffs — took the train from his Williamsburg, Brooklyn, housing project into Manhattan, later telling the police that he went to the East Village in search of people partying, and that he wanted to kill as many white people as he could.

The rampage began around 2 a.m., when he demanded a man’s wallet and then shot him in the torso.

Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said after the shooting that the attack was so bizarre that it could only have been the product of someone who was “clearly deranged.”",nytimes.com,True

Alternate endings to the commercial on a Snickers Web site showed the two clobbering each other, and related video clips featured players from the Super Bowl teams reacting, not unexpectedly, with squeamish distaste. The outrage voiced by gay rights groups similarly held little surprise.

“This type of jeering from professional sports figures at the sight of two men kissing fuels the kind of anti-gay bullying that haunts countless gay and lesbian schoolchildren on playgrounds across the country,” Joe Solmonese, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. A spokesman for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation condemned the advertisement as “inexcusable.” Masterfoods USA, a division of Mars and the maker of Snickers, withdrew the offending ads.

But for some the commercial left the lingering question of who owns the kiss? How is it that a simple affectionate gesture can be so loaded? Why is it that behavioral latitudes permit couples of one sort to indulge freely in public displays lusty enough to suggest short-term motel stays, while entire populations, albeit minority ones, live real-time versions of the early motion picture Hays Code: a peck on the cheek in public, one foot squarely planted on the floor?

The freedom to kiss in public is hardly the most compelling issue for most gay rights advocates, or perhaps even in the minds of many gay Americans. Yet the symbolic weight of simple gestures remains potent, a point easy to observe wherever on the sexual spectrum one falls. “Whose issue is it? Why is it only a gay issue?” said Robert Morea, a fitness consultant in New York.

Although Mr. Morea is heterosexual, his client list has long included a number of high-profile professionals, the majority of them gay women and men. “The issue is there because for so many years, people got beaten up, followed or yelled at,” he said. “Even for me as a straight man, it’s obvious how social conditioning makes it hard for people to take back the public space.”

After considering herself exclusively lesbian for decades, Sarah Van Arsdale, a novelist, not long ago found, to her surprise, that she had fallen in love with a man. At first, as she wrote last week in an e-mail message from a writer’s colony in Oaxaca, Mexico, “ Whenever we would hold hands in public, I felt a frisson of fear, waiting for the customary dirty looks or at least for the customary looking-away.”

In place of revulsion, Ms. Van Arsdale was startled to discover that, having adjusted her sexual identity, she was now greeted by strangers with approving smiles. “I felt suddenly acceptable and accepted and cute, as opposed to queer,” she said.

While few are likely to have shared Ms. Van Arsdale’s singular perspective, her experience is far from exceptional. “I’m a very openly gay man,” said Dane Clark, who manages rental properties and flies a rainbow flag from his house in Kansas City, Kan. “My partner and I don’t go kissing in public. I live in probably the most liberal part of the State of Kansas, but it’s not exactly liberal. If I was to go to a nice restaurant nearby and kiss my partner, I don’t think that would go over very well.”

As many gay men have before him, Mr. Clark chose to live in a city rather than the sort of small town where he was raised in the hope that Kansas City would provide a greater margin of tolerance and also of safety. Even in nearby Independence, Mo., he said, “if you kiss your partner in a restaurant, you could find somebody waiting for you outside when you went to the car.”

But haven’t things changed radically from the days when lesbians and gay men were considered pariahs, before gay marriage initiatives became ballot issues, before Ellen DeGeneres was picked to host the Oscars, and cable TV staples like “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” made a competitive sport of group hugs?

In some senses and in certain places, apparently, they have. The landscape of acceptance, as the Snickers commercial inadvertently illustrated, is constantly shifting — broadening in one place and contracting somewhere else. The country in which anti-gay advocates like the Rev. Fred Phelps once drew headlines for picketing Matthew Shepard’s funeral and preaching what was called “a Day-Glo vision of hatred” can seem very far away at times from the laissez-faire place in which an estimated 70 percent of Americans say they know someone who is gay.

“We don’t administrate public displays of affection,” said Andrew Shields, World Church Secretary of the Community of Christ, a Christian evangelical church with headquarters in Independence. “Homosexuality is still in discussion in our church. But our denominational point of view is that we uphold the worth of all persons, and there is no controversy on whether people have a right to express themselves.”

The tectonics of attitude are shifting in subtle ways that are geographic, psychic and also generational, suggested Katherine M. Franke, a lesbian who teaches law and is a director of the Center for the Study of Law and Culture at Columbia University. “I’ve been attacked on the street and called all sorts of names” for kissing a female partner in public, Professor Franke said. “The reception our affection used to generate was violence and hatred,” she added. “What I’ve found in the last five years is that my girlfriend and I get smiles from straight couples, especially younger people. Now there’s almost this aggressive sense of ‘Let me tell you how terrific we think that is.’ ”

Yet gay-bashing still occurs routinely, Mr. Patton of the Anti-Violence Project said, even in neighborhoods like Chelsea in Manhattan, where the sight of two men kissing on the street can hardly be considered a frighten-the-horses proposition. “In January some men were leaving a bar in Chelsea,” saying goodbye with a kiss, Mr. Patton said. “One friend got into a taxi and then a car behind the taxi stopped and some guys jumped out and beat up the other two.” One victim of the attack, which is under investigation by the police department’s Hate Crimes Task Force, was bruised and shaken. The second had a broken jaw.

“The last time I was called a faggot was on Eighth Avenue,” said Joe Windish, a longtime New Yorker who now lives in Milledgeville, Ga., with his partner of many years. “I don’t have that here, and I’m an out gay man,” said Mr. Windish, whose neighbors in what he termed “the reddest of the red states” may be fundamentalist Christians who oppose gay marriages and even civil unions, but “who all like me personally.”

Tolerance has its limits, though, as Mr. Windish found when he and his partner took a vacation on a sleepy island off the coast of Georgia. “I became aware that if I held my partner’s hand, or kissed him in public, the friendliness would stop,” he said.

What Mr. Windish calls a level of peril is possibly always in play, and this no doubt has something to do with the easily observed reality that a public kiss between two people of the same sex remains an unusual occurrence, and probably not because most are holding out for the chance to lock lips over a hunk of milk chocolate, roasted peanuts and caramel.

“We forget here, because New York has been relatively safe for a while, that hate is a problem,” said Roger Padilha, an owner of MAO public relations in New York. The reminders surface in everyday settings, he said, and in ordinary ways.

“My boyfriend and I always hold hands and, when we feel like it, we kiss,” Mr. Padilha said. Yet some weeks back, at a late movie in a Times Square theater, as Mr. Padilha went to rest his hand on his partner’s leg — a gesture it would seem that movie theaters were invented to facilitate — he recoiled as sharply as had one of the Snickers ad guys.

“He was like: ‘Don’t do that. It’s too dangerous,’ ” Mr. Padilha said. “And afterward I thought, you know, my dad isn’t super into P.D.A.’s, but nobody’s ever going to beat him up because he’s kissing my mom at a movie.

On the other side of the gallery, more than a dozen of Mr. Sandy’s relatives and friends were accompanied by representatives of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, a victims’ advocacy group.

Mr. DiChiara said Mr. Fortunato had cooperated with the police, submitting himself for questioning even as he weathered the trauma of his own father’s death around the time of the crime. He would not flee on bail for fear of costing his widowed mother her home, Mr. DiChiara argued. He was not accused of striking any blows, only arranging the crime.

Then Mr. DiChiara struck at the central contention in the case.

“We have a hate crime here,” he said, “where there is no hate.”

An assistant district attorney, Anna-Sigga Nicolazzi, argued that there was evidence that connected Mr. Fortunato to the crime. She said that his family resources should not merit special treatment. She questioned the account of his cooperation with investigators and underscored his role in the crime, calling him “the prime mover.”

And she argued that there was demonstrable hate, by the language of the law, because Mr. Fortunato had singled out Mr. Sandy based on his attitudes toward gay men.

As of Friday, Greensboro police had filed charges against five football players, primarily for assault and ethnic intimidation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had begun an investigation to determine whether the attack was a hate crime.

Since the attack, several students, including members of minorities, have worn T-shirts saying, “I don’t feel safe here,” and, “Hate crimes happen at Guilford College.”

And one victim, along with Guilford’s director of multicultural education, Sekinah Hamlin, has called the incident a hate crime. Students and faculty and staff members have come together in customary Quaker fashion — for a worship service at the New Garden Friends Meeting House near the site of an Underground Railroad station across from the campus, for discussions where all were encouraged to speak and for a daytime vigil. A loose confederation of activist students organized a walkout from classes on Thursday in solidarity with the crime victims.

While some students praise Ms. Hamlin as trying to create a safe atmosphere for minority students to voice their concerns after the beatings, others, including friends of several athletes on campus, accuse her and some students of fostering a divisive, fearful atmosphere.

Even the most ardent activists say the incident has led to a lot of stereotyping and name-calling.

In spite of the divisions, students across campus sounded remarkably similar themes on Friday, whether at a tiny liberal hangout called the Greenleaf Cafe, a dorm-basement co-op or at the sprawling dining room in Founders Hall. All expressed the desire for everyone to stop stereotyping the attack or anyone involved in it and for people not to rush to judgment but instead have the patience to let the investigative process work itself out.

“Getting to the truth is going to be a process,” said Lili Sharpless, 21, a third-year student from Germantown, Pa. “You have to trust that. A lot of people feel the football players should be suspended without going through the process.”

Ms. Thomas expressed a similar idea, lamenting divisions among students that she thinks are superficial and wrongheaded.

Throughout the trial, critics said the identification of the suspects was severely flawed. The police never presented the victims or Ms. Alford with a line-up or photographs that included people who were not suspects. Instead, Mr. Williams, the defense lawyer, said in his closing statements, officers told Ms. Alford, “We got them,” as they drove her to a supermarket parking lot near the scene of the attacks to identify the suspects.

Defense lawyers did not dispute that the white women were attacked, but they called it a “high school fight” that got out of control and said 911 callers indicated that the victims were being attacked by boys, not girls.

Mr. Williams and other defense lawyers pointed to the testimony of two other witnesses whose accounts differed from Ms. Alford’s. They also said the three women had initially fought with the group and that there was evidence the victims had been drinking alcohol that night. The women denied drinking and provoking the attack.

Race-related fights afflict school campuses and jails, and two major riots, in 1965 and 1992, are hardly forgotten. But civil rights advocates say that the violence grew at an alarming rate last year, continuing a trend of more Latino versus black confrontations and prompting street demonstrations and long discussions on talk-radio programs and in community meetings.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Much of the violence springs from rivalries between black and Latino gangs, especially in neighborhoods where the black population has been declining and the Latino population surging. A 14 percent increase in gang crime last year, at a time when overall violent crime was down, has been attributed in good measure to the interracial conflict.

This month, the authorities reported that crimes in the city motivated by racial, religious or sexual orientation discrimination had increased 34 percent in 2005 over the previous year. Statistics for 2006 have not yet been compiled.

Rabbi Allen Freehling, executive director of the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission, a group created after the 1965 riots, said the recent growth in hate crimes reflected a failure by government and community leaders to prepare residents for socioeconomic changes in many neighborhoods, “and therefore people have a tendency to lash out, out of desperation.”

But even with the alarm caused by the recent increase in bias crimes, Constance L. Rice, a veteran civil rights lawyer, said that, considering Los Angeles’s diversity, race relations remained relatively calm and were even marked by many examples of groups getting along.

Still, in several corners of the city, particularly where poverty is high and demographics are shifting, tensions have been flaring.

“You don’t find entire segments of the city against one another,” Ms. Rice said, “but in the hot spots and areas of friction you find it is because the demographics are in transition and there is an assertion of power by one group or the other and you get friction.”

“They shot a Mexican guy right around the corner from here and nobody protested or said anything,” said the man, who asked that his name not be used for fear of retaliation. He referred to neighborhood speculation that Cheryl’s killing was in retaliation for the killing of Arturo Mercado, a Latino shot to death in the neighborhood a week before Cheryl in what the police call an unexplained shooting.

The violence in that neighborhood and others has prompted a flurry of announcements by Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa and police officials promising a renewed crackdown on gangs, particularly those responsible for hate-related crimes. Mr. Villaraigosa plans to meet Friday with Robert S.

Cheryl Green’s killing particularly alarmed community and civil rights advocates because of her age and the indication that the neighborhood’s long history of racial violence was continuing. Two Latino gang members have been charged with murder in the case. With the district attorney having filed a formal allegation that the men were motivated by hate, they could be eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without parole if convicted.

Earl Ofari Hutchinson, an African-American syndicated columnist who plays host to the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a weekly gathering in the Leimert Park neighborhood of South Los Angeles, said blacks complained that illegal Latin American immigrants were stealing jobs. Latinos, particularly newcomers unaccustomed to living among large numbers of African-Americans, in turn accuse blacks of criminal activity and harassing them.

“I think L.A. is a microcosm of what could happen in big cities in the future,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “When we have the kind of tension you see in L.A. in the schools, the workplace and now hate-crime violence, my great concern is this is a horrific view of what could happen in other cities.”

They also hope to bring that philosophy to bear on some of the most divisive social issues in politics, like abortion.

In their first days in session, Senate Democratic leaders reintroduced a bill that they said was indicative of their new approach: the Prevention First Act, which seeks to reduce the number of abortions by expanding access to birth control, family planning and sex education.

In the House last week, Democrats showcased a vote on expanding federal financing for embryonic stem cell research, which, despite fierce opposition from many conservatives, has won bipartisan support among lawmakers -- and voters -- who are otherwise divided on abortion.

The mantra, for many Democrats, is the search for common ground. On gay rights, lawmakers and advocates said the most likely legislation in the new Congress would focus on hate crimes and employment discrimination, issues expected to be much less polarizing than the debate over same-sex marriage that was front and center in the Republican Congress.

''I don't think the American people get mad if you say a woman shouldn't get fired from her job because she's a lesbian,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts.

Conservatives are skeptical that such a search for common ground is much more than a shift in tactics.

''I can tell you what I expect,'' said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee. ''I think the Democratic leadership will seek to advance the policy agenda of the hardcore groups but do so under the cover of deceptive rhetorical campaigns.''

Whatever the Democrats do, these issues retain their power to divide. Monday is the 34th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision recognizing a constitutional right to abortion; it will highlight anew, with a day of marches and protests, the fundamental question of abortion's legality.

But the Democrats' moves toward consensus-building on issues that often resist consensus reflect their effort to adjust to a new political reality. Their majority is slimmer than it was the last time they were in power, especially in the Senate. The country, some pollsters say, has grown more conservative on abortion and other social issues.

And conservatives, by controlling which legislation came to the floor, succeeded in defining the debate over social issues for more than a decade, through votes on same-sex marriage and the procedure opponents call partial-birth abortion, in ways that highlighted the political limits of liberalism.

One measure of how the legislative debate has shifted is that the last time the Democrats were in power, one of the biggest abortion fights was over whether abortions should be covered in the benefit package guaranteed under the Clinton administration's national health insurance plan, which eventually collapsed. Abortion rights leaders focus on far more modest goals today.

In the past 12 years, Democratic strategists say they have learned some hard lessons. Many said they were dismayed to see the religion gap after the 2004 election, with the Republicans' overwhelming strength among churchgoers and the widespread perception that Democrats were a secular party insensitive to issues of values.

Since then, party leaders say, they have tried hard to connect with those voters, to convince them that, as Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said, ''We are not a bunch of libertines who want to see the superego of society disappear.'' Some of the new, prominent Democrats in Congress, like Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, are social conservatives, recruited and cited by Democratic leaders as evidence of the party's diversity.

Over the past two years, Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, formerly the caucus chairman, now the majority whip, has led a ''faith working group'' in the House in an effort, Mr. Clyburn said, to get members ''more comfortable with these issues and more connected with values voters.''

Part of this effort involved broadening the definition of values-related issues, he said, to include economic issues like raising the minimum wage, assisting low-income children with health insurance and shoring up Social Security.

''That's Old Testament Bible, taking care of widows and orphans,'' Mr. Clyburn said.

Some House Democrats said they had also learned to be more open about their own religious life.

''We, for a very long time, left the definition of ourselves as Democrats to others,'' said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, an abortion-rights supporter and one of 55 Catholic Democrats in the House who signed a Catholic Statement of Principles last year, essentially saying that their faith involved more than their position on abortion. ''But I think people finally felt enough. Enough. It's about who we are, where we come from, what our culture and environment has been.''

Ms. DeLauro is one of the leaders in the House on legislation that would try to reduce the need for abortion and provide economic support to new parents.

Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, highlighted her Catholicism in her first week in office, with two high-profile church services in Washington. There have been occasional protests from religious conservatives, challenging the rights of Democrats like Mrs. Pelosi to present themselves as both good Christians and supporters of abortion rights. But Democrats did do better among Catholic voters in last year's elections, carrying 55 percent of their vote in House races, compared with 49 percent in 2004.

In large part, analysts say, that reflects voters responding to the Democrats on Iraq and the economic agenda, another element of the Democrats' common ground strategy, keeping the debate focused on issues of greatest concern to the voters in the middle. ''Our first focus is on the meat and potatoes issues that affect all Americans,'' Mr. Schumer said.

Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who advises Congressional leaders, said, ''Most swing voters think that these social issues are issues that both sides love to have fights over, but that they don't really have a stake in.''

In fact, Democrats, like Republicans, have long had to fight the notion that they are in thrall to the advocacy groups because of these hot-button issues. Republicans clearly took a dip in the polls after their intervention in the right-to-die case of Terri Schiavo, and many strategists say their intense pursuit of a ban on same-sex marriage and other conservative causes ultimately backfired, making them seem out of touch.

Democrats, after 12 years in the wilderness, say they are not likely to repeat those mistakes. But as Mr. Johnson of the right to life committee and other skeptics note, the true test of the Democrats' common ground campaign may not come until there is a major court fight, especially a vacancy on the Supreme Court. When the fundamental debate over the extent of abortion rights is front and center, common ground will be hard to find.

The officials did describe another hunter, James Allen Nichols, 28, of nearby Peshtigo, as a “person of interest” in the death, and they said he was being held on charges of a parole violation and firearms possession.

A convicted burglar, Mr. Nichols was arrested last Saturday, when he went to a medical center with a gunshot wound.

The Hmong, struggling to maintain their patience, were further agitated this week when a woman saying she was Mr. Nichols’s fiancée told a newspaper in Milwaukee and The Associated Press that he had called her from the woods and said he had attacked a man who did not speak English.

The woman, Dacia James, told reporters that Mr. Nichols had said that he “didn’t know if he killed the guy” and that he had acted out of fear and self-defense. Ms. James did not return calls for comment.

As of Friday, law enforcement officials said it was unclear whether Mr. Nichols had legal representation. According to a criminal complaint from an earlier burglary, Mr. Nichols used red paint to scrawl a racial slur and the letters K.K.K. in the cabin of a Wisconsin man. He was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He earned his high school equivalency diploma before his release in 2002.

A coordinator at the United Hmong Community Center here, Blong Vang, said Ms. James’s account, and what is perceived as a less-than-speedy response from state and local officials, had begun to solidify concerns among the Hmong that the killing of Mr. Vang, 30, a recent immigrant with five children, was a hate crime and that they might not see timely justice for the killer.

Vang is a common Hmong surname.

“Right now, it’s almost a week and we have no information, no charges, and that’s strange and confusing to me,” Blong Vang said at the vigil. “We are waiting for answers to many questions that have come about whether this was a hate crime. I tell the community to calm down.”

Mayor Jim Schmitt of Green Bay held a candle in the frigid weather as he told 200 mourners: “I know there’s some anger when bad things like this happen. We need to practice some patience and know that justice will be served in this matter.”

The Hmong said they were doubtful about what to expect, given the history of misunderstanding and tension between them, relative newcomers from the mountainous regions of Laos, and the residents of the long-established communities into which they have immigrated across the North-Central states, most of whom are of European descent.

The Hmong were granted refugee status at the end of the Vietnam War in return for their service to Americans on and off the battlefield. A majority settled in Minnesota, around Minneapolis and St. Paul. About 40,000 went to Wisconsin, including 6,000 in the Green Bay region.

The Hmong and longtime residents share a love of hunting, and most of their clashes have occurred in the woods. In fall 2004, a group of hunters confronted Chai Soua Vang, a Hmong from St. Paul who, the police said, was hunting from a tree stand on their property in north-central Wisconsin. The police said that after Mr. Vang, a naturalized citizen, had been told to leave, he opened fire on the hunters, killing six. He is serving six consecutive life sentences.

After the shootings, many Hmong stopped hunting, fearful that their larger community would be held responsible for one man’s crimes and that in the woods they could be easy targets.

While there were no reports of that happening, some Hmong said they faced a more insidious everyday type of discrimination. Restaurants and service station attendants often refused to serve them.

Other than that, Hmong leaders said, things had been mostly quiet, until last weekend. All that changed when word spread that an autopsy showed that Cha Vang’s death had been intentional. Law-enforcement officials also said that whoever killed him had tried to hide the body, covering it with leaves and plywood.

Mr. Vang and his family arrived from a Thai refugee camp two years ago. They spent much of their time working odd jobs and studying English.

“Cha was a very good man, he had many friends, and he tried his best to adapt to the culture and the ways in this country,” said Vaugh Vang, executive director of the Lao Human Rights Council in Green Bay. “He wanted to contribute productively to the community and also had the American dream for his family.

“If justice is not served, hunting is going to be very uncertain for Hmong-American hunters in the state of Wisconsin for years to come.”

Some Hmong leaders fear a new cycle of violence.

“All of us were in shock to find out that this happened again,” said Mr. Kiatoukaysy, of the Hmong-American Friendship Association. “It’s like, Whoa, what’s going on? Is it war up there?

“I truly believe that an eye for an eye will only dig us deeper into this. We need to see eye to eye.”

Toward that end, Cha Vang’s wife, Pang Vue Vang, issued a message of forgiveness and asked other Hmong not to jump to conclusions just because no charges had been filed.

Through an interpreter, Ms. Vang said, “Time doesn’t matter as long as they find justice in this case.”",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/world/europe/14germany.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"BERLIN, Jan. 13 — Germany wants to use its European Union presidency to push through legislation that would make denying the Holocaust punishable by stiff prison sentences in all 27 of the union’s member states.

Germany’s justice minister, Brigitte Zypries, said Thursday night that Germany’s commitment to combating racism and xenophobia — and keeping the memory of the Holocaust alive — was both an enduring historical obligation and a present-day political necessity.

“We have always said that it can’t be the case that it should still be acceptable in Europe to say the Holocaust never existed and that six million Jews were never killed,” she said. Under the German proposal, she said, those who deny the Nazi slaughter of Jews during World War II could face up to three years in prison if convicted.

Ms. Zypries said the proposal, which will be debated by the bloc’s justice ministers in the next six months, would also seek to criminalize racist declarations that are an incitement to violence against a person or group. The aim, she said, was to harmonize national legal systems in their approach to combating racism and xenophobia.

Unifying the handling of hate crimes in countries with vastly different legal cultures could prove difficult, legal analysts said. European leaders have been unanimous in condemning those who deny the Holocaust, and they sharply criticized the Iranian government for sponsoring a recent conference that sought to cast doubt on it.

But the question of whether to criminalize such acts has divided Europe. Germany sees a European Union law on denial as a moral imperative, but other countries, like Britain, Italy and Denmark, have resisted common rules as infringing on free speech and civil liberties.",nytimes.com,True

The authorities said that the four men devised a plan to rob someone, and that they chose a gay person, thinking he would be less likely to fight back.

“It wasn’t a hate crime against blacks or gays,” said a 17-year-old woman who said she knew all four men, but would not give her name. “They were just hanging out and drinking.

Officials say they believe the four gathered at Mr. Fortunato’s house on Sunday and began exchanging instant messages with Mr. Sandy, whom they may have found through the gay-themed Web site Adam4Adam.com. They apparently accessed the Web by tapping into a neighbor’s wireless Internet connection and used Mr. Fox’s America Online account and screen name, “fireyefox,” to exchange instant messages with Mr. Sandy, the officials said.

Posing as a single individual, they proposed a tryst. “Fireyefox” told Mr. Sandy to go to the corner of Emmons and Coyle Streets, about a block from Mr. Fortunato’s home in Sheepshead Bay, around 7:30 p.m. But when Mr. Sandy arrived, both Mr. Fox and Mr. Fortunato were waiting for him, officials said.

After arriving home, however, he continued exchanging messages with “fireyefox” and was eventually persuaded to return. They encouraged Mr. Sandy to bring marijuana and $100 for a hotel room. Mr. Sandy balked at the idea of a hotel room. He agreed to have sex on the beach and said he would bring a blanket. The last message was sent about 8:50 p.m.

He arrived back in Sheepshead Bay sometime after 9 p.m. This time, only Mr. Fox awaited him. They drove together in Mr. Sandy’s blue Mazda to the narrow, dark parking lot by Plumb Beach, a few blocks away.

Once Mr. Sandy was out of the car, the officials said, all four men confronted him. According to the criminal complaint against Mr. Shurov, he punched Mr. Sandy. It is not known if the other three men did as well.

As the attack went on, the men drifted toward the highway. Then Mr. Sandy walked onto it, waving his arms both to ward off the blows and to stop traffic. According to witnesses, he made it to the middle of the road. Mr. Fortunato and Mr. Timmins ran away, the officials said.

But according to the complaint against Mr. Shurov, two of the men struggled with Mr. Sandy on the Belt Parkway.

But the attack was not over. Before departing, according to the witnesses cited in the criminal complaint, Mr. Shurov rifled through Mr. Sandy’s pockets.

He found nothing, and all four returned to Mr. Fortunato’s home later that night.

Philip J. Smallman, a lawyer for Mr. Fox, said that his client did not personally attack Mr. Sandy.

“There is no allegation that Mr. Fox at any time used any violence against Mr. Sandy,” Mr. Smallman said. “He’s approximately 5-3 and 120 pounds.” Mr. Smallman said he did not have enough information to comment on the possible use of Mr. Fox’s Internet account to lure Mr. Sandy.

Michael F. Braun, a lawyer for Mr. Timmins, said “my understanding is that Gary Timmins took no part in the assault or attempted robbery of Mr. Sandy.” He said that his client was “at best minimally involved” in the attack. A lawyer for Mr. Shurov did not return phone calls.

Mr. Fortunato’s lawyer, Joseph Mure, declined to comment on the officials’ account, and added that his client had made no statement to anyone about last Sunday’s events.

When the police arrived at Mr. Sandy’s apartment, they found his computer on. They tracked the origin of the messages he had received to a home in Sheepshead Bay. But the owner of the home, they determined, was not involved. Whoever had sent the messages had apparently logged on by piggybacking on that person’s wireless connection.

But by subpoenaing America Online, investigators said, they were able to tie the screen name to Mr. Fox, whom they found in his dorm.

After questioning Mr. Fox, the officials said, the police went in search of Mr. Timmins and Mr. Shurov. Mr. Shurov was arrested by police on Monday after an extensive search; tipped off that police were in front of his home, he tried to sneak in by climbing up a rear fire escape, but was caught, law enforcement officials said.

Both Mr. Fortunato and Mr. Timmins later turned themselves in. Mr. Fortunato arrived at a local precinct station accompanied by his lawyer, the officials said. He was questioned and released.

Mr. Sandy, who worked in the interiors department at Ikea on Long Island, lingered in a coma for several days at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center. Doctors told his relatives he was unlikely to live. They removed Mr. Sandy from life support. He died at noon on Friday.

The victim, Michael J. Sandy, turned 29 on Thursday. McCartha L. Lewis, his aunt, said dozens of his friends and relatives gathered at Mr. Sandy’s bedside at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center about noon as he was taken off a respirator that was supporting his breathing.

The other two suspects are Gary Timmins, 16, of Gerritsen Beach, and Ilye Shurova, 20, of Sheepshead Bay. The three men were charged yesterday with first-degree assault as a hate crime, and first- and second-degree robbery, also as hate crimes, according to the police. The men face a potentially longer prison term than if the hate crime statute was not applied, according to a spokesman for Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney.

The fourth suspect was being questioned at the 61st Precinct stationhouse in Brooklyn last night, the police said. It was unclear what role each of the four men played in the incident, according to the police.

“The perpetrators had an online interaction with the victim, and they lured him,” said one investigator, referring to what he said was an exchange of AOL instant messages over the course of about an hour.

When asked why the case was being classified as a hate crime, the investigator said: “Because of the totality of the evolution of the crime.”

But the case underlined the fine distinction prosecutors must consider when applying the state’s hate crime law. Under the law, established in 2000, a hate crime is typically defined as one in which a victim is chosen because of race, color, sexual orientation, religious practice or some other protected category, said Brian S. MacNamara, an assistant professor of law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

“The prosecutor will have to prove that in the underlying assault and robbery the victim was targeted in some way because of his sexual orientation,” said Professor MacNamara. “It’s a little bit tricky because, obviously, the main crime was the robbery, so you have to prove that the motivation for selecting that victim was substantially because he was gay.”

He later defended his son to reporters, speaking about his son’s goal of becoming a naval officer, and said he was perplexed by the hate-crime charge. “He never did anything like that before,” the elder Mr. Fox said. “Why would he be rabidly anti-gay? I don’t know.”

McCartha L. Lewis, Mr. Sandy’s aunt, said the family was rallying to support her nephew as he remained in critical condition yesterday at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center. She said that Mr. Sandy was in a coma with his breathing supported by a respirator, and that the family was struggling with whether to remove him from it.

Ms. Lewis said the family wanted to wait at least until today, Mr. Sandy’s 29th birthday, before making that decision.

In a videotaped confession, Mr. Grant, who had spent 24 years in prison for rape and assault, said he was looking to kill a blond, blue-eyed white person that day; Ms. Russo-Carriero was a blonde, though her eyes were green.

“She met your specificity for hate: she was white,” Justice Adler told Mr. Grant, who wore a striped buttoned shirt and green pants that looked one size too small.

The killing of Ms. Russo-Carriero cast a harsh light on the way Westchester County deals with its homeless population. But above all, it stunned for its savagery and randomness, and it stirred raw emotions, which burst out into the open during the sentencing in State Supreme Court.

“He’s not an animal,” she said. “He’s a man who is disturbed, who’s had a horrible life, and he does have sadness in his heart for what happened.”

The police said Mr. John had assaulted his girlfriend and attacked the officer — grabbing his baton and moving aggressively toward him — before the officer shot Mr. John four times. Mr. John had a history of violence, the police said.

Mr. John’s family says he did not have the baton when he was shot and is filing a wrongful death lawsuit against city officials, the Police Department and the officer.

The San Juan County Sheriff’s Office, which investigated Mr. John’s death, concluded that the shooting was justified. But after an outcry from Navajo Nation officials, the United States Justice Department is reviewing the matter to determine if a federal inquiry is necessary.

Both events have rocked this commercial hub of about 42,000 residents on the eastern edge of the Navajo Nation. After Mr. John’s shooting, the Navajo Council allocated $300,000 to study racial violence in the 11 towns that border Navajo land and to finance the John family’s lawsuit.

On Sept. 2, amid growing unease, Navajo leaders organized a march they said drew 1,000 participants. The march snaked along Highway 64, which leads to the Navajo community of Shiprock.

“We marched to memorialize the people that have died because of racial violence here,” said Duane Yazzie, president of the Shiprock chapter of the Navajo Nation. “This was an outlet for people who are frustrated and angry.”

Similar marches 32 years ago protested the severe, sometimes violent treatment of Navajos, like the practice of beating drunken Navajos passed out on Farmington’s streets.

In 1975, the Civil Rights Commission released “The Farmington Report: A Conflict of Cultures,” which described widespread prejudice against American Indians in Farmington and said they had suffered in almost every area from injustice and maltreatment.

These days, Farmington is no longer the Selma, Ala., of the Southwest, as some derisively called it then. The town has more Indians — about 17 percent of its residents, compared with less than 10 percent in the mid-1970’s. The Civil Rights Commission, revisiting Farmington in 2004, found marked progress.

“When these things happen, we still have to be concerned, and we have to listen,” he said. “We have thousands of interactions between people in Farmington where nothing happens. But when things do go wrong, the culprit is usually alcohol. For the most part, it’s not racism that drives Farmington’s problems today, it’s alcohol.”

“They told me they wished it was a Native American officer that was involved,” said Mr. Burridge, adding that his officers underwent cultural sensitivity training that specifically addressed Navajo issues.

But Larry Emerson, chairman of the New Mexico Indian Education Advisory Council, said white residents had not absorbed the history of Indian subjugation and its psychological and social effects.

“The bias, the unfairness, this has been going on all along,” said Mr. Emerson, who is Navajo. “Our people have suffered intergenerational trauma. They’re so numb to it, they can’t feel own their feelings anymore.”

Racial violence — like the bludgeoning death in 2000 of a 36-year-old Navajo woman by two white men — still occurs, if less frequently. Mr. Emerson and Mr. Yazzie said many crimes against Navajos went unreported.

“We’ve become so accustomed to our treatment by the Anglo community, we just accept it as normal,” said Mr. Yazzie, who was shot by a white hitchhiker in 1978 and lost an arm in the attack.

Mr. Yazzie said he believed outsiders, new to Farmington and its complicated racial dynamic, were to blame for the upswing in violence. He said he considered Mr. John’s shooting unjustified and wanted the federal government to intervene, as it did in the 1970’s. Other tribal leaders agree.

“We’ve come a long way since 1974, but sometimes it takes the feds to move things in the right direction, said Joe Shirley Jr., the president of the Navajo Nation. “Otherwise, it doesn’t get done.”

Russia has experienced a surge in racist violence in recent years, from isolated acts of assault and murder to last month’s bombing of a Moscow market, which killed 12 people, most of them from Central Asia; three university students have been charged.

But the events in Kondopoga have exposed a strain of ethnic strife that extends beyond the acts of neo-Nazis and skinheads, infecting society as a whole 15 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union discredited the enforced harmony of Russia’s many nationalities.

Ethnic tensions across Russia have been fueled by the latent racism common among many Russians, who freely use the pejorative “blacks” when describing people from the Caucasus, even in casual conversation. It also reflects a growing political opposition to migrant workers not unlike those movements in Europe and the United States and the indifferent or at times hostile responses from elected officials when violence erupts.

The police in Kondopoga have arrested more than 100 people, including the three accused of murder in the bar fight. But Sergei L. Katanandov, governor of Karelia, the region near Finland that includes Kondopoga, did not blame the mobs for the violence, but rather the people who were singled out.

“The behavior of certain young men who moved here from the Caucasus and other territories in recent years — not that many of them, but they were visible — has been beyond the pale,” he said in an interview with Izvestia on Thursday.

It is not clear exactly how many people fled Kondopoga as the violence flared, but in addition to the 49 Chechens now staying at the camp near Petrozavodsk, many are believed to be staying with friends or relatives.

The economic success of migrants is at the source of many xenophobic statements, even ones by prominent officials. The country’s leading nationalist politician, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, said migrants should be barred from owning markets or shops, hotels, restaurants and bars.

“Restaurants and retail outlets should be in the hands of local residents, first and foremost,” he said in a radio interview after the violence in Kondopoga. “Otherwise clashes with local residents are inevitable.”

Such views resonate in Kondopoga, a town of 37,000 people with a large pulp-and-paper factory. The town and its surrounding district are overwhelmingly Russian, with a smattering of Karelians and Finns. According to the last census, in 2002, migrants from the Caucasus account for less than 1 percent of the population, but they have become the focus of residents’ complaints about crime and, especially, economic inequity.

Meantime, she added, “Ours are unemployed.”

Kondopoga remains tense. Little of the damage has been repaired. The open-air market’s stalls are half empty. The families who fled remain afraid to return. “We were refugees from the war and are refugees again,” Mr. Taikhinneki said. “We are guilty just because we are Chechen.”

And violence continues. Last Wednesday, arson damaged a sports center frequented by Chechen children and run by a Chechen coach.

Reached by phone, Mr. Liu said he was unaware that Mr. Avella, whom he called “a hard-working council member” whose point of view on fostering community diversity differ from his own, had tried to contact him.

No love lost between these neighboring councilmen. Mr. Avella, who admits to fluency in English only, terms their lack of rapport “sad.” Mr. Liu, whose office answering machine offers a menu of six languages, said his “real difference of opinion” with Mr. Avella could be traced to his colleague’s attempt to force signs in foreign languages to include English translations.

The notion makes him huffy, which makes his ruddy face blush redder. As chairman of the Council’s first Italian-American caucus, which denounced “The Sopranos” for its Mafia-mania, and as an active irritant to the National Alliance, a neo-Nazi group that infiltrated Queens in the 90’s, Mr. Avella considers himself the consummate anti-bigot.

“I want to make one thing clear,” he said. “There is no connection between people uncomfortable with non-English signage and the people who committed this crime. Those people are racists. The sign issue is a ‘good neighbor’ issue. People who say it denies freedom of speech, well, I don’t buy that argument at all. If anything, foreign-language signs promote segregation.”

His tirade against overdevelopment is not, he said, a rant against Asian builders. It is, he said, about putting “10 pounds of potatoes in a five-pound bag.”

He thinks political correctness is trumping common sense. This is why he will put his political cards on the table: he is against raising Council salaries, against lulus (stipends for committee chairmen), against repealing term limits without voter permission.

In the last five years, the commercial corridor along Northern Boulevard from Flushing to Douglaston has undergone a major transformation, with an influx of Korean restaurants, salons and markets.

Korean entrepreneurs ready to expand out of an increasingly crowded downtown Flushing found themselves unable to build west on Northern Boulevard because Chinese businesses had already staked out that ground, according to Pyong-Gap Min, a professor of sociology at Queens College. Instead, they went east, about as far as Bell Boulevard, razing and retrofitting older buildings along the way.

Members of earlier immigrant groups have taken notice. “The entire strip of Northern Boulevard in the past four or five years went from German and Italian to Korean,” said a 24-year-old Italian-American man working at Ceriello Italian Fine Foods on Douglaston Parkway. He did not want to give his name.

Dr. Min, who is Korean, recalled instances of bias when he moved to Bayside two decades ago, including the placing of nails in the tires of an Asian friend’s car. “Now it’s much better,” he said. “All of my neighbors are Chinese. I am surrounded by Chinese. I feel very comfortable there.”

Indeed, the population of Douglaston, Little Neck and Bayside is now estimated to be about one-third Asian, Dr. Min said.

To Mr. Liang, a student from Douglaston, there was little question that racism was at play.

Brown, the Queens district attorney, said in a statement yesterday.

One of the students, John C. Lu, a Little Neck resident enrolled at the State University at Albany, said he had never experienced anything like it.

“I don’t know what to say,” he remarked outside his family’s home late yesterday, still wearing a bandage over his right eyebrow. “It’s the first time something like this has happened to me.”

The authorities said that Kevin M. Brown, 19, of Auburndale, Queens, and Paul A. Heavey, 20, of Little Neck, were charged with assault and criminal harassment, and that each of the charges was elevated to a hate crime because of the nature of the attack and the slurs that were used.

Mr. Brown also was charged with assaulting the arresting officers, and resisting arrest. He had already been awaiting trial on an assault charge. The police said Mr. Brown attacked a man with a hammer after a collision and dispute on a Queens street in May.

Robert Brown, his father, said yesterday that he did not believe his son would be involved in a racially motivated attack. He said the charges against his son, who works as a parking valet at a Queens restaurant, and Mr. Heavey, who installs alarm systems, were particularly hard to believe because they had been outnumbered by the students.

“It’s a fairy tale,” Mr. Brown said outside his wood frame house in Auburndale. “It was four against two.”

There was no response at the Heavey home yesterday afternoon. Both defendants were arraigned yesterday in Queens Criminal Court. Mr. Brown’s bail was set at a $30,000 bond or $20,000 cash, and Mr. Heavey’s bail was set at $10,000. It was not clear if they posted bail yesterday.

Mr. Brown’s lawyer, Brian Kennedy, said yesterday that no racial epithets had been used, and that the matter was only a traffic dispute that had gotten out of hand. “We deny any kind of racial bias,” he said.

But a Douglaston resident, who said he was returning home in a taxi and pulled up as the confrontation was taking place, said yesterday that he had clearly heard epithets.

“It was definitely bias,” said John Pangia, 42, a private investigator who lives on Douglaston Parkway near 44th Avenue, where the attack on the students occurred. He said he saw two white men kicking and punching two young Asian men as people on the block looked out their windows and pleaded with them to stop, and while two other Asian men stood by trying to call for help on their cellphones.

Besides Mr. Lu, the group of students included Reynold Liang of Little Neck, David Wu of the Bronx, and Wing Chung Poon of Bayside, the authorities said. Mr. Lu said they had all been friends since attending middle school in Queens, and were riding with Mr. Liang in his family’s Lexus when the attack occurred.

Mr. Liang, an architecture student at the State University at Stony Brook, was the most seriously injured in the group. He was struck in the head by the steering wheel locking device known as the Club, which he had removed from the Lexus to defend himself, but which was taken and turned against him during the assault, the district attorney’s office said.

A woman who identified herself as Mr. Liang’s mother, but declined to give her name, said yesterday that the incident “hurt us so much, it really hurts.” She spoke briefly outside the family’s richly landscaped home on a block in Little Neck where houses are valued at more than $1 million.

The two groups of young men had not encountered each other before the confrontation on Saturday, said Nicole Navas, a spokeswoman for the district attorney.

According to an account provided by the district attorney’s office, the events began about 2:30 a.m. when Mr. Brown and Mr. Heavey, in Mr. Brown’s 1998 Toyota, pulled alongside the Lexus “and began cursing and shouting racial slurs.” Moments later, the Toyota rammed the back of Lexus, the authorities said.

They said Mr. Liang then sped away, and pulled his car over at 44th Avenue and Douglaston Parkway after he thought he had eluded the Toyota. But when Mr. Lu got out to inspect the damage to the Lexus, Mr. Brown and Mr. Heavey drove up.

Hurling more racial slurs, the two men punched and kicked Mr. Lu, according to the district attorney’s account. When Mr. Liang tried to come to his companion’s aid, he was pummeled, it said.

Mr. Pangia, who said he was pulling up in the taxi at that point, said he heard either Mr. Brown or Mr. Heavey shouting “You want more?” as the attack went on. “This thing was ugly,” Mr. Pangia said, adding that Mr. Liang’s “face was all cracked open.”

He said he approached Mr. Brown and Mr. Heavey, warning them that they might be committing murder, and the two men got back into the Toyota and drove off just before the police arrived. Mr. Pangia said he told the officers he could identify the assailants, and rode with the police in pursuit.

According to the district attorney, the Toyota was spotted and pulled over in Bayside, at the intersection of Cloverdale Boulevard and 46th Avenue. Mr. Pangia said he observed as the two officers approached, and Mr. Brown became violent.

“I don’t know who this kid is or what he was on, but he was superhuman,” Mr. Pangia said. As one of the officers reached into the Toyota, trying to restrain Mr. Brown, Mr. Pangia said Mr. Brown put the car in drive, lurching forward, and the door closed on the officer’s head and arm.

Moments later, as both officers tried to put handcuffs on Mr. Brown, he fought back, injuring the other officer, Mr. Pangia said.

City Councilman Tony Avella, whose district includes Douglaston, Little Neck and other neighborhoods in northern Queens, said he knew of no racially motivated violence that had been directed against the growing number of residents of Chinese and Korean descent.

He said there has been tension, particularly over what many longtime residents view as overdevelopment, some of it by Asian developers. Another sticking point, he said, are commercial signs in Korean or Chinese, with no English translation, which ""give people the impression that some businesses don’t want to serve the whole community.""

Mr. Avella said he has introduced legislation calling for all commercial signs in another language include a translation in English.

But he said hate crimes have not been a source of concern. If there were attacks on young people of Asian descent, “their parents would be on my phone immediately,” Mr. Avella said.

Hugh M. Mo, a Chinese-American resident of Douglaston Manor and a deputy police commissioner in the 1980’s under Mayor Edward I. Koch, said that Asian residents have spread into areas that have been traditionally non-Asian, “and obviously some ethnic whites find it hard to accept.”

But the police tell a different story. They say the people of Gerritsen Beach have turned inward and wrapped themselves in silence. Deputy Inspector Michael J. Osgood, commanding officer of the Hate Crimes Task Force, said residents of areas where other racially charged episodes occurred — in Howard Beach, Queens; Mill Basin, Brooklyn; and Great Kills, Staten Island — had readily provided the investigators with useful tips.

But the more people in Gerritsen Beach are pressed for information, Inspector Osgood said, the more they shut down.

“The people in the community are refusing to speak to the N.Y.P.D.,” Inspector Osgood said. “We’ve never had this happen before in the city of New York.”

When asked, many people in Gerritsen Beach insisted they did not hear or see anything on the night of June 26.

Joseph Jirovec said his son Michael, 21, who was arrested and released on Wednesday, heard a commotion outside that night and tried to defuse it. Richard DaSilva, 18, who was also arrested and released Wednesday, said he was knew something was happening but was not involved. Others, who would not give their names, said that the black teenagers were trying to steal bicycles and that a fight erupted when local boys tried to stop them.

“Clearly, something happened,” said Edgar De Leon, a lawyer who represents one of the accused teenagers, Joseph DeSimone, 17. “But just to be out in the street does not mean you’re involved.”

Inspector Osgood, though, painted a more menacing picture.

The black teenagers — Winston Johnson, 16, Eron Augustus, Deon Davis and Joseph Pascall, all 15 — took a wrong turn into Gerritsen Beach’s maze of dead-end streets after playing basketball in a nearby park, he said. Each on his own bike, they passed a group of young white men and teenagers, he said.

According to Inspector Osgood, one of the white youths yelled, “Are you here to steal?” He said others shouted racial slurs and that one of the local youths then sent out an alert on his cellphone, drawing others into the streets.

Young men in a brown Toyota Camry hit Mr. Johnson’s bike, the inspector said, knocking him off. Mr. August and Mr. Davis pedaled away, he said. Mr. Pascall was also knocked off his bike but ran and hid on another street, the inspector said. A neighbor found him, trembling, and called 911.

Mr. Johnson was hit and kicked by the crowd that had quickly formed, Inspector Osgood said, but he then escaped, took a wrong turn, encountered them again and escaped once more. A neighbor found the teenager running, bloodied and scared out of his wits, and drove him to his home in Kings County, Inspector Osgood said.

“The Good Samaritan sees Winston full of blood and chased by at least 20 whites,” he said. “That gentleman probably saved his life.”

But residents said that since that night, the police scrutiny has been unbearable, forcing residents into a deep retreat. Police sweeps of the neighborhood, they said, have picked up too many innocent young men and unfairly smeared their reputations.

They also fiercely resent and reject any suggestion that their neighborhood is racist.

“My kids are raised to be colorblind, and their integrity has been compromised and my family is broken by this,” said Mr. Jirovec, a fireman. His sons, Joseph, 18, and Michael were linked to the attack, although Mr. Jirovec said the charges against Michael were later dropped.

“It’s like an ugly shadow,” he said. “It’s like a scarlet letter.”

The father of one of the alleged victims, who lives in Brownsville, Brooklyn, scoffed at the notion that the boys were in Gerritsen Beach to steal bicycles.

“They have their own bikes. Why would they steal bikes?” said Trujillo Davis, Deon Davis’ father. “They ended up in the wrong neighborhood, that’s all.”

The shooting “was a result of a mentally ill person,’’ the lawyer said. “It was not a rational act at all.”

Before the shooting, Mr. Haq was facing a charge of lewd conduct for allegedly exposing himself in a shopping mall near his family’s home in Pasco, about 180 miles from Seattle in southeastern Washington. He has pleaded not guilty in that case.

Mr. Donohoe said of the claim that Mr. Haq was mentally ill: “I don’t think we’ve received any information about any history, so I don’t think that figures in. I don’t think that would play a role at this point.”

Mian Haq, Mr. Haq’s father, is from Pakistan. He and his wife, Nahida, had been active in the Muslim community around Pasco for three decades, friends said.

Naveed Haq is an American. He graduated in 1998 from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., with a degree in biology, according to university records. He attended the University of Pennsylvania’s school of dentistry but dropped out “when his mental illness became a problem,” Mr. Stephenson said.

“He stopped going to classes,’’ the lawyer said. “His moods were all over the place.”

But Mr. Haq later enrolled at Washington State University and earned a second degree, in electrical engineering, in 2004, Mr. Stephenson said. Since then, he had been unable to find a steady job in engineering and had recently worked at a Lowe’s in the Seattle area.

Mr. Stephenson said Mr. Haq’s mother had tried to stop him from going to Seattle last week, but only because she was concerned about him in general and not because she knew of his plans.

“His mother was very good about reading him,’’ he said.

Mr. Stephenson said the Haqs’ letter was being faxed Monday to the federation’s offices in Seattle and to Temple B’nai Torah in Bellevue, where funeral services were held for Ms. Waechter on Monday. Mian Haq hand-delivered a letter to Congregation Beth Sholom in Richland, he said.

Esther Herst, executive director of Temple B’nai Torah, said the temple had received the letter.

Gil Kerlikowske, said Saturday at a news conference. “And he pointedly blamed the Jewish people for all of these problems. He stated he didn’t care if he lived.”

The chief said the gunman apparently selected the federation as a target by randomly searching the Internet for Jewish organizations in the area. The police confiscated at least three computers, he said.

Chief Kerlikowske described an intense and violent scene inside the federation, with some of the 18 people there jumping from second-story windows and a pregnant woman crawling to call 911 after being shot in the arm as she covered her abdomen. When the gunman later found her on the phone with emergency dispatchers, she refused to hang up.

“She was able to get him to take the telephone,” the chief said, calling her “a hero in my eyes.” The woman, Dayna Klein, 37, is five months pregnant.

The Islamic Center of Tri-Citiesissued a statement on Friday condemning the attack and saying, “We disassociate this act from our Islamic teachings and beliefs.”

The police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have said they believe Mr. Haq was acting alone.

The Seattle Times reported Saturday that Mr. Haq was also facing a charge of lewd conduct in Benton County, in southeast Washington, accused of exposing himself in public.

Chief Kerlikowske said Mr. Haq “was so enraged at first” on Friday but later calmed down and followed the emergency dispatchers’ instructions to leave the building with his hands up. He surrendered to the police at the federation offices near downtown 12 minutes after the shootings were first reported to 911.

Reported hate crimes declined 4.5 percent in 2005 from the previous year, to 1,691.

Prosecutors insisted that the word was evidence that Mr. Minucci selected Mr. Moore, 23, because of his race. The defense maintained that Mr. Minucci, who grew up in Lindenwood, an ethnically diverse neighborhood adjacent to Howard Beach, used the epithet as a form of address, as it is commonly used now in street parlance and rap songs.

In State Supreme Court in Queens yesterday, Justice Buchter said Mr. Minucci “repeatedly used the ‘n’ word in ways and in a manner that can best be described as an affront to Glenn Moore’s worth as a human being.”

Then he sentenced Mr. Minucci to 15 years for first-degree robbery as a hate crime, as well as prison terms for additional charges, to be served concurrently. By law, Mr. Minucci must serve more than 12 years of the sentence before becoming eligible for parole.

“Only a wretched person could sink to such lows as using a bat to the side of someone’s head,” he said before addressing Mr. Minucci personally, criticizing him for having “never taken full responsibility for your actions” and for being “arrogant and unremorseful” in statements he gave to the authorities after his arrest.

“You need to look at your actions and see the ignorance in it,” Mr. Moore said.

Before being sentenced, Mr. Minucci stood and pleaded for leniency, saying that Queens prosecutors turned him into a “monster” for political purposes.

Mr. Minucci, who during court appearances over the past year has gone from burly and cantankerous to gaunt, looked resigned to his fate. Dressed in slacks, shirt and tie, he said that he did not attack Mr. Moore because of his race, but rather to protect a friend, whom he believed Mr. Moore had threatened minutes earlier.

He blamed prosecutors for charging him with hate crimes just because the attack occurred in a white neighborhood with a racially tinged past.

“This is a hate crime because of Howard Beach,” he said. Then he turned to Mr. Moore’s mother and said, “For any pain at all, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.”

Mr. Moore testified at the trial that he and two black friends had set out that June night to steal a car and that he was walking in Howard Beach carrying a bag of tools.

Mr. Minucci, driving in his 2005 Cadillac Escalade with two white friends, came upon the three black men. He hopped out, wielding an aluminum bat, and began chasing Mr. Moore through the empty, darkened residential streets.

Mr. Minucci was found not guilty of a top charge, first-degree assault as a hate crime, but was convicted of first- and second-degree robbery as a hate crime. He used the bat to rob Mr. Moore of his Air Jordan sneakers, a pair of Prada shoes and a blue polo shirt.

Earlier yesterday, the justice denied a motion by Mr. Minucci’s lawyer, Albert Gaudelli, to set aside the verdict, claiming that the attack, “an insignificant altercation between two people,” was seized upon by Queens prosecutors, who for political reasons created erroneous charges and incomplete evidence.

Outside the courtroom, Mr. Gaudelli said his client was the victim of politically motivated, overblown prosecution of an attack that “happens every day of the week” and brought out politicians and activists eager to get headlines by grandstanding against racism in Howard Beach.

“The term Howard Beach has become synonymous with racism,” he said. “The political people in this city use Howard Beach as a rallying cry against racism.

As he was handcuffed and led out of the courtroom, Mr. Grant kept his head down and did not look at the gallery, where dozens of Ms. Russo-Carriero’s relatives and former colleagues filled four rows of benches.

Mr. Grant faces 20 years to life in state prison at his sentencing, scheduled for Sept. 11. As a hate crime, the murder charge carries the same maximum sentence but a higher minimum one.

But legal experts say it is almost certain that Mr. Grant will never be released if the State Legislature adopts a civil commitment measure, known as Connie’s law, for the victim’s nickname, that would keep the most violent sex offenders locked in institutions even after their time is served. A bill that would create the measure is being considered in the State Assembly.

Mr. Grant was a felon with a history of violent rapes when he began staying in a county-run shelter at the Westchester County Airport in 2003. Every morning at 6 a.m., he was put on a bus to White Plains with other shelter residents. But after the killing, the county faced such fierce criticism that it ended the busing and hired trained monitors to shadow the most dangerous sex offenders staying in its shelters.

The victim’s family sued the county and the City of White Plains in September, accusing them of negligence. The suit is pending.

The hate crime charge against Mr. Grant stemmed from statements he made in a rambling, 45-minute confession videotaped by detectives. On the tape, which was played in court, Mr. Grant said he suffered from depression and anxiety and was desperate for medication.

Paranoid that a group of white men were following him and plotting against him, he shoplifted a steak knife, hid on the top floor of the garage and waited for hours, he said, until he spotted a white person.

Ms. Russo-Carriero, a paralegal from White Plains, was found lying in a pool of blood by a passer-by about 1 p.m.; she had two stab wounds to her chest.

But Mr. Grant’s lead defense lawyer, Eugene Traynor, insisted throughout the trial that Mr. Grant had made a false confession because he was mentally ill and had been pressured by detectives. He argued vociferously that Mr. Grant had not been read his Miranda rights and suggested in his closing argument that Mr. Grant had been roughed up.

“This defendant did not get the treatment you would expect to get from police,” he said. “He got the homeless black guy treatment.”

Prosecutors pointed to strong DNA evidence, including drops of the victim’s blood that were found on Mr. Grant’s trousers and under his fingernails.

After the verdict, Mr. Traynor said he would appeal, citing “procedural issues” with the case, including pretrial publicity and his insistence that Mr. Grant’s confession was unconstitutionally obtained. Throughout the case, he fought to have the confession thrown out and repeatedly demanded that Judge Lester B. Adler call a mistrial, prompting the judge to lose his patience on Monday.

The report said that neo-Nazi groups like the National Alliance, whose founder, William Pierce, wrote ""The Turner Diaries,"" the novel that was the inspiration and blueprint for Timothy J. McVeigh's bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, sought to enroll followers in the Army to get training for a race war.

The groups are being abetted, the report said, by pressure on recruiters, particularly for the Army, to meet quotas that are more difficult to reach because of the growing unpopularity of the war in Iraq.

The report quotes Scott Barfield, a Defense Department investigator, saying, ""Recruiters are knowingly allowing neo-Nazis and white supremacists to join the armed forces, and commanders don't remove them from the military even after we positively identify them as extremists or gang members.""

Mr. Barfield said Army recruiters struggled last year to meet goals. ""They don't want to make a big deal again about neo-Nazis in the military,"" he said, ""because then parents who are already worried about their kids signing up and dying in Iraq are going to be even more reluctant about their kids enlisting if they feel they'll be exposed to gangs and white supremacists.""

The 1996 crackdown on extremists came after revelations that Mr. McVeigh had espoused far-right ideas when he was in the Army and recruited two fellow soldiers to aid his bomb plot. Those revelations were followed by a furor that developed when three white paratroopers were convicted of the random slaying of a black couple in order to win tattoos and 19 others were discharged for participating in neo-Nazi activities.

The defense secretary at the time, William Perry, said the rules were meant to leave no room for racist and extremist activities within the military. But the report said Mr. Barfield, who is based at Fort Lewis, Wash., had said that he had provided evidence on 320 extremists there in the past year, but that only two had been discharged. He also said there was an online network of neo-Nazis.

""They're communicating with each other about weapons, about recruiting, about keeping their identities secret, about organizing within the military,"" he said. ""Several of these individuals have since been deployed to combat missions in Iraq.""

The report cited accounts by neo-Nazis of their infiltration of the military, including a discussion on the white supremacist Web site Stormfront. ""There are others among you in the forces,"" one participant wrote. ""You are never alone.""

The assault, which the police said took place on a beach in Rocky Point, was the latest in a series of attacks on Latino immigrants in Suffolk County.

The four teenagers — William Foley, 16; Nicholas J. Provenzano, 19; Daniel Sturgis, 19; and Jesse Lee Ward, 18; all of Rocky Point — are non-Hispanic whites. They were charged with robbery and assault as hate crimes, both felonies, and arraigned yesterday in Suffolk County's First District Court in Central Islip.

Judge Paul Hensley ordered Mr. Sturgis held in $100,000 cash bail or $200,000 bond and the other three in $25,000 bail or $50,000 bond. All four were being held at the county jail last night.

James D'Angelo, who represented Mr. Ward and Mr. Foley in court, said all four pleaded not guilty. ""They are denying involvement in this,"" Mr. D'Angelo said.

Violence toward Latino immigrants has erupted regularly in Suffolk.

Nearly six years ago, two white supremacists tried to kill two Mexican day laborers in Shirley. In 2003, a Mexican family's house in Farmingville was firebombed. Last year, a Latino community leader was beaten in Montauk by a man who shouted ethnic slurs. And in April a teenage neo-Nazi sympathizer chased three Latino classmates in East Hampton with a machete and a chain saw that he was revving.

Mr. Aviance, 38, said that he had not yet been shown pictures of the four suspects. He said that the thing he remembered most was the shoes. ""They were wearing Air Force sneakers,"" he said, referring to a popular model made by Nike. ""I can still hear their feet in my head.""

In his room at Beth Israel Medical Center, surrounded by friends and dozens of roses, Mr. Aviance recounted the attack, saying that it started when one of the men shouted at him, using anti-gay slurs. ""You're not diesel,"" someone shouted, in obscenity-laced language. ""Who do you think you are?""

The men threw trash bags at him, and then one of them threw a spray can that missed him, prompting laughter from the other men, he said. ""His friends are making fun of him,"" Mr. Aviance said. ""He's angry."" The young man who had thrown the can then punched Mr. Aviance, and the other men joined in the attack. As the men attacked him, Mr. Aviance recalled hearing people yelling at the attackers to stop.

The police were not immediately able to provide statistics on the number of anti-gay bias crimes this year, but community activists said they often noticed a spike in June, in the weeks before the Gay Pride Parade, which is coming up in New York City on June 25.

While Muslims represent a spectrum of ethnic and national backgrounds, the study focused on Arab-Americans in order to understand the experience of one group more deeply, said Nicole Henderson, the lead author of the report. An estimated two-thirds of Arab-Americans are Christian.

Arab-Americans reported an increasing sense of victimization, suspicion of government and law enforcement, and concerns about protecting their civil liberties, according to the study, which was paid for by the National Institute of Justice, a research agency of the Justice Department.

A fear of surveillance ranked high among their concerns. During one focus group, a woman told the story of an encyclopedia salesman who came to her door and asked to use the bathroom. She worried that he might have been an agent trying to plant a listening device in her home.

While hate crimes against Arab-Americans spiked after Sept. 11, they have decreased in the years since, according to both law enforcement and Arab-American respondents.

A series of post-9/11 policies have sown the deepest fear among Arab-Americans, including unease about the USA Patriot Act, voluntary interviews of thousands of Arab-Americans by federal agents, and an initiative known as Special Registration, in which more than 80,000 immigrant men were fingerprinted, photographed and questioned by authorities.

These new measures threatened to harm decades of work by police departments to build trust in their communities, especially among immigrants, the study concluded. After 9/11, federal agents increasingly turned to the police for help with gathering intelligence and enforcing immigration laws, Ms. Henderson said.

F.B.I. agents were also given expanded powers to arrest people for immigration violations in connection with terrorism cases.

The study concluded that there was confusion among both F.B.I. agents and the local police about their roles in enforcing immigration, and that their resources had been stretched thin by counterterrorism initiatives.

John Miller, an assistant director for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said the report confirmed many of the realities facing the bureau.

""We have finite resources and tremendous responsibilities,"" Mr. Miller said. ""When you take 40 percent of your resources and turn them towards national security issues in the wake of Sept. 11 because of a significant and demonstrable threat, you're going to see a strain on resources.""

The degree to which police officers have enforced immigration laws varied, according to the study: Some departments formally deputized officers to arrest people for immigration violations, while other departments left this to the discretion of officers.

Both Arab-Americans and law enforcement personnel expressed dismay about the reporting of false information in the form of anonymous tips. F.B.I. agents said they had responded to calls stemming from petty disputes, business competition and dating rivalries, according to the study.

""It reminds me of Syria,"" an Arab-American was quoted as saying in the study. ""If someone wants to get you, they will call the police.""

Both Arab-Americans and law enforcement respondents acknowledged that the relationship between them was necessary, but could be improved.

Mr. Miller said the process would take time.

""We didn't bring this on the community — the terrorists did,"" he said. ""The community is paying for that. We are paying for that as law enforcement because when we're doing our investigations, it seems like we're singling out a group or a religion and the fact is, we're not.

Mr. Gaudelli sought to portray Mr. Moore as a chronic car thief, getting him to admit that he served a month in jail for stealing a car in 2003.

Prosecutors say Mr. Minucci, 19, attacked Mr. Moore, 23, who has admitted that he came into the predominantly white neighborhood to steal a car. They say Mr. Minucci committed a hate crime by selecting Mr. Moore because of his color, and used a bat to fracture his skull.

A second leader, Dmitri Borovikov, was shot to death as the police tried to arrest him last Thursday in what appeared to be a wave of arrests. Mr. Zaitsev did not say when the other arrests had occurred, though Russian news reports said it was last week. Mr. Zaitsev said the police continued to search for at least five other members of the group.

The group's members are accused of killing Lamzar Samba, a 28-year-old student from Senegal, who was shot in the neck as he left a St. Petersburg nightclub on April 7. Although foreigners and Russians of non-Slavic ancestry routinely face violent assaults, his death was believed to be the first racially motivated killing involving a firearm.

Mr. Zaitsev went on to accuse the group of killing an Armenian and a Korean, as well as two of its own members. Without elaborating, he said the group was also involved in the killing of Nikolai M. Girenko, a Russian anthropologist who became an expert on neo-Nazis, skinheads and other extremist movements.

Racially tinged violence is routine here, with attacks occurring almost daily. Many more are believed to remain unreported by immigrants who fear police retaliation or abuse.

The Sova Center, a research organization in Moscow that tracks hate crimes, said at least 17 racially motivated killings had already occurred in Russia this year, a pace that would yield a total well in excess of the 31 reported last year. The center has tallied at least 104 violent assaults. Most of the victims are visitors from Asia or Africa or members of Russia's myriad ethnic groups.

The violence has prompted sharp criticism at home and abroad. In a report released this month titled ""Violent Racism Out of Control,"" Amnesty International called the response by the authorities ""grossly inadequate,"" despite public denunciations of racism by Mr. Putin.",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Moore and two black friends approached Mr. Minucci and held a screwdriver to his neck, Mr. Minucci said in both statements. After they ran away, Mr. Minucci said, he picked up a friend, Anthony Ench, and confronted Mr. Moore on a nearby street.

""I was like, 'What up?' "" Mr. Minucci said in a statement, showing detectives how he held out his hands challenging Mr. Moore to fight.

In the statement, he used the epithet, which lawyers have referred to as the ""N"" word, but has said he did not mean it as an insult. ""He said, 'What up?' — like he was ready to fight.""

He said he chased Mr. Moore, who was waving a screwdriver, and hit him in the legs with a bat only to immobilize him until the police could be summoned.

""It's self-defense, no?"" Mr. Minucci told investigators in a 30-minute, freewheeling videotaped narrative.

It seemed to spellbind the jury and court spectators, not only because of its importance to the trial, but also because of Mr. Minucci's blunt, emphatic narrative style that included blurted anecdotes of rough-and-tumble life in a racially charged area of Queens.

A police detective, Anthony D'Angelo, took the stand and testified that Mr. Minucci initially denied committing the attack and said he was home watching ""Entourage"" on television. When informed that ""Entourage"" was not on that night, Detective D'Angelo said, he recanted and began describing how Mr. Moore and two black friends had seen him three days earlier wearing a gold chain and Rolex watch, and ran into him on the night of the attack near the Ragtime newsstand on Cross Bay Boulevard.

"" 'Look at the little white boy,' "" Mr. Minucci said one of the black men remarked before holding a screwdriver to his neck and asking where his watch and chain were.

A car approached and the men ran off, Mr. Minucci said. So he jumped into his sport utility vehicle and picked up Mr. Ench to help him look for the men. Seeing Mr. Moore, Mr. Minucci said, he jumped out of the S.U.V., grabbed a bat from under his seat and began chasing him.

Mr. Minucci, at 240 pounds, said he was gasping and wheezing and had decided to give up chasing the faster, 165-pound Mr. Moore when Mr. Moore tripped on a short brick barrier, wounding his head in the fall. Mr. Minucci hit him four times, in the buttocks and in the kneecap, which he knew from personal experience would hobble him.

""I've been hit in the kneecap with a bat, and I wasn't able to move,"" he explained.

Still, Mr. Minucci said, Mr. Moore got up and ran, but was grabbed by Mr. Ench, who ripped off the black man's sneakers and told him, ""You want to rob people, now you get robbed.""

Mr. Minucci said he never hit Mr. Moore in the head and any inspection of the wound would show a gash or a scrape from concrete, not a smack from a bat. He added that he wanted to wait for a police officer, but Mr. Ench dissuaded him.

One witness scheduled to testify is Frank Agostini, another friend of Mr. Minucci's who was initially held by the police but never charged.

Mr. Agostini's father is a New York police detective, and the son's role has been sketchily described by both sides in the trial. Family and friends of Mr. Minucci say it was Mr. Agostini who was robbed by the three black men, not Mr. Minucci, and that Mr. Minucci — possibly because of a misguided sense of loyalty — is claiming to be the robbery victim.

Asked about this yesterday outside of court, Mr. Minucci's lawyer, Albert Gaudelli, conceded that future witnesses may present this account and that if it is true, Mr. Minucci is doing it out of ""a convoluted sense of loyalty.""

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

""There are glaring inconsistencies in this case, and it's not my responsibility to resolve any of them,"" Mr. Gaudelli said. ""He didn't go after these guys because they were black. It was because they were there.""

He said detectives persuaded Mr. Minucci to talk by playing down the charges and promising leniency.

Mr. Minucci's testimony provided an interesting sampling of life in Howard Beach as lived by a charismatic teenager known as Fat Nick. On the tape, Mr. Minucci tells detectives that he has no job but drives a $60,000 Cadillac Escalade and wears a $6,000 Rolex watch and a $4,000 gold chain. Mr. Minucci said he acquired the items as gifts and had money from $80,000 he received by selling a bread route.

Mr. Minucci told investigators that he was idle, but no outlaw. He cruised the streets of Howard Beach all night in his Escalade, which he bragged about extensively in his statements to the police.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

""Nobody in the neighborhood has one like it,"" he said, talking about its 24-inch sleek black rims and blue fog lights.

Outside of court, in a lighter moment, Mr. Gaudelli described the phone numbers that detectives found on Mr. Minucci's cellphone after his arrest.

""You have Big Frankie, Little Frankie, Fat Tony, Clumsy Carmine, the Nose, the Hat, the Foot, you name it,"" he said.

Several times in the taped statements, investigators from bias units seemed to be asking Mr. Minucci leading questions about black people in his neighborhood.

And Mr. Minucci mentioned crimes he believed had recently been committed in Howard Beach by black men, which he criticized the police for failing to investigate. This included the stabbing of a 14-year-old white boy by ""a car full of black people.""",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/nyregion/24howard.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"At some point, he said, a black Cadillac Escalade pulled up and two men burst out, one of them screaming an epithet and demanding to know what they were doing in the neighborhood. A prosecutor, Mariela Herring, asked him what the yelling sounded like, and Mr. Pope responded, ""It was kind of racial.""

Mr. Pope said he and his friends fled in separate directions. He returned to see a beaten Mr. Moore limping down the street.

During the cross-examination, there were many hostile exchanges between Mr. Pope and Mr. Minucci's lawyer, Albert Gaudelli, who repeatedly questioned Mr. Pope about his many prior arrests and convictions. As he left the stand, Mr. Pope smirked at Mr. Minucci and gave a pronounced swagger step.

Mr. Moore is expected to testify this week. His mother, Chandra Eison, attended the proceedings yesterday. Outside the courthouse, she said her son was nervous.

""He's going to be honest and just say what took place,"" she said, adding that Mr. Minucci ""has to pay the piper.""

""Nobody appointed him judge and jury and enforcer of the neighborhood,"" she said. ""He should have gotten on the phone and said, 'There are characters in my neighborhood, and I think they're up to no good.' ""

But Mr. Minucci's lawyer, Albert Gaudelli, presented the jury with another version of events. Yes, the three black men came to Howard Beach to steal a car that night. And yes, Mr. Minucci set upon Mr. Moore, uttered a racial epithet — one the defense contends is widely used as a greeting — and struck Mr. Moore on the leg with an aluminum bat. But Mr. Gaudelli offered a citizen's arrest defense, claming that Mr. Minucci was protecting his neighbors from men who he feared were about to commit a robbery. He cited a statement given to investigators that night by Richard Pope, one of Mr. Moore's friends, saying that the men could not find a car to steal and tried to ""salvage the evening"" by looking for a house to rob.

Mr. Gaudelli maintains that Mr. Moore and his friends instigated the confrontation by insulting Mr. Minucci's friend, Frank Agostini, 22.

""They came upon Frank Agostini, a skinny white boy with a gold chain,"" Mr. Gaudelli said. Using a racial epithet to describe black people, they made fun of the chain, he said.

Mr. Gaudelli said Mr. Agostini ran away, then happened upon Mr. Minucci. They picked up another friend, Anthony Ench, and drove back looking for the men, finding Mr. Moore near 159th Avenue and 81st Street.

Mr. Minucci chased Mr. Moore, who tripped and hit his head on the ground, Mr. Gaudelli said. He said trial testimony would prove that the police found no evidence that the bat had come into contact with Mr. Moore's skin or hair. Mr. Gaudelli said this supported his claim that Mr. Minucci struck Mr. Moore in the leg and buttock, to detain him after he tripped.

Mr. Gaudelli chided prosecutors for omitting from their account any mention of Mr. Agostini, who is scheduled to testify for the prosecution. Mr. Agostini, the son of a New York detective, was not charged.

""You can draw your own inferences from that,"" said Mr. Gaudelli, who dismissed the attack as ""a minor dust-up between six men"" and something that ""happens every day.""

But the episode snowballed into a 19-count, hate-crime trial for his client, he said, because of politics. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Queens prosecutors seized upon ""what happened that night, for political purposes."" The mayor, up for re-election at the time, ""was in trouble in the black community"" in terms of voter support, he said.

""It's an overindictment and an exaggeration,"" he said.

Mr. Minucci was raised in the more racially diverse neighborhood of Lindenwood, but was well-known around Howard Beach for his personality, his swagger and his 2005 Cadillac Escalade with flashy rims. Because of his girth, he was known among friends as Fat Nick, but after spending the past 11 months in jail — mostly in solitary confinement — he appeared more trim in court. Dressed yesterday in dark slacks, a white shirt and a tie, he often glanced behind him at the many family members and friends attending the trial.

The first witness, an emergency medical technician who responded to the scene that night, said that he found Mr. Moore sitting on a curb holding his head. He said that Mr. Moore had a bit of blood on his earlobe and had seizures.

During questioning of the second witness, James O'Sullivan, a crime scene detective who worked the case, jurors were presented with Mr. Minucci's bat and sneakers recovered from the Escalade.

Ms. Herring said that Mr. Minucci, at 240 pounds, and Mr. Ench, at 6-foot-2 and 300 pounds, overwhelmed Mr. Moore, who weighed 165 pounds.

She dismissed the claim that the case hinged on whether Mr. Minucci had used a racial epithet as a symbol of hate or as what has become an accepted means of address.

""This case is not about the 'n' word and whether its meaning has changed, because clearly it hasn't,"" she said.",nytimes.com,True
http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/nyregion/23nyc.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"But the Queens prosecutors have raised the stakes. They want to send Mr. Minucci away for many years, and then some. They have charged him not only with assault but also with assault as a hate crime. Conviction of a hate crime, thinking thoughts deemed impure while committing a wrongful act, can lead to extra prison time under New York State law.

That, however, requires climbing into someone's head and heart to find out what he believes on matters of race, religion, sexual orientation or age.

How do we do that?

Well, let's see. Mr. Minucci is white, and Mr. Moore is black. While pummeling Mr. Moore, the indictment says, Mr. Minucci used racial slurs, one in particular. It is a distasteful word, abhorred so widely that many cannot bear the sound of it. In polite society, it is now often referred to only as the ""n"" word.

In truth, you hear the word, the real word, almost every day on the streets of this brave city. It trips easily off the tongues of many young black men in animated conversation. For them, some say, it is essentially a term of endearment.

But in the mouth of a Mr. Minucci, the prosecutors say, it is a sign of how much he hates those very people who show mutual affection by yelling ""n""-word this and ""n""-word that.

The city, you see, is not just brave. It is also complicated.

This word helped put Mr. Minucci in deeper trouble than he was already in by virtue of the terrible deed he is accused of doing. You have to wonder what might have happened had he been graced with a richer vocabulary. What if, while swinging that baseball bat, he had called Mr. Moore, say, a boil-brained dolt? Would the charges against him have been lighter? Apparently.

THE attempt to divine a suspect's inner feelings, instead of letting his actions stand on their own, is what troubles many opponents of hate-crime laws, like the one enacted by New York State in 2000. Critics also dismiss these laws as little more than feel-good measures.

You want feel-good? George E. Pataki, the governor who would be president, said when he signed the New York law, ""It is conceivable that if this law had been in effect 100 years ago, the greatest hate crime of all, the Holocaust, could have been avoided.""

Complicating matters is an uneven application of the law that may puzzle many New Yorkers.

Last month, four black teenagers, accused of trying to rob a white college student in Harlem, chased him into the path of a car that struck and killed him. ""Get the white guy,"" they yelled, according to a witness. They were not charged with a hate crime. But five black teenage girls were so charged after they beat a group of white girls in Brooklyn last year while chanting phrases like ""white cracker.""

Whatever one may think of the law on its merits, consistent enforcement has not exactly been a hallmark.

At the start of the Minucci trial yesterday, an assistant district attorney in Queens, Mariela Herring, cautioned the multiracial jury against getting too hung up on a single word. ""This case is not about the 'n' word and whether its meaning has changed because clearly it hasn't,"" Ms. Herring said.

Perhaps. But depending on its outcome, this case may well serve as a warning to anyone else who chooses to swing a baseball bat illicitly.

More than a few people in East Hampton knew that the teenager who is accused of luring three Hispanic boys into a shed behind his mother's house, supposedly to attend a party, had been espousing neo-Nazi skinhead beliefs long before the episode. But there is no indication that anyone — not his classmates, teachers, parents, friends' parents or school officials — tried to intervene.

The boy and his friends — four of whom are said to have witnessed the attack — were widely known in school as ""the skinheads,"" wore camouflage clothing and black shirts, and shaved their heads, classmates said. The police said a search of the shed found Nazi paraphernalia. Similar materials were found by investigators in the Farmingville case, in which two men were convicted and are now serving prison sentences.

The East Hampton boy had apparently also posted a photo of himself giving a Nazi salute on MySpace.com, which was deleted at the behest of school officials' after the attack.

Raymond D. Gualtieri, superintendent of the East Hampton schools, said that before the attack he was unaware of the Web page or the boys' white-supremacist beliefs and that he could not think of any other racially motivated episodes in the schools in the past year.

""I walk through the high school every day, and I see a lot of kids wearing camouflage,"" Mr. Gualtieri said. ""I believe the school is a reflection of the larger community, and the South Fork is a microcosm of what's happening across the United States right now. It's not unique.""

About 700 people attended a public meeting on Monday, drawn both by the April 29 episode and by rumors that the accused boy's friends were planning violent revenge for his arrest. Though those rumors were dismissed as baseless, some angry parents complained at the meeting that their Jewish, black or Hispanic children were regularly harassed in school and demanded to know what the school had done about the hostile atmosphere.

Members of anti-immigration groups, including some with roots in Farmingville, frequently speak out, often angrily, at South Fork events. And there have been several hate-crime incidents in Southampton in the last year.

Parents said it was only a matter of time before such hostility took hold among children as well as adults.

In public forums, community leaders call for discussion and education to combat intolerance, but they acknowledge that tangible solutions to the mounting frictions are hard to come by. Scores of residents are expected to attend a follow-up meeting at the high school on Monday.

Meanwhile, parents have called for a formal tolerance curriculum in the schools and for officials to break up the de facto segregation of the high school cafeteria, where black, Hispanic and white students congregate in separate areas.

Advocates for minorities also want more black and Hispanic teachers hired. A district spokesman said that 5.5 percent of the high school staff — including administrators and custodians as well as teachers — is black or Hispanic, compared with nearly 25 percent of the town's population.

Reared in rural Virginia, one of seven children born to a tobacco-farming couple, Mr. Oliver was a quiet, courtly man who, according to family members, held a variety of jobs after moving to New York in the 1970's: as a worker in a handbag factory, a salesman at a jewelry store and, in recent years, a housecleaner for affluent clients in Manhattan.

Wilson Oliver, 67, said he could not imagine why anyone would want to harm his brother, a pacific soul who mostly kept to himself.

Although he worked when he could, his brother said, William Oliver did not earn enough money to rent his own place so he alternated between his older brother's apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant and his sister's house in Flatbush. Mr. Oliver would get a bed and home-cooked meals, and his siblings would enjoy his good-natured company and the benefits of his industriousness.

Walking and listening to music, family members said, seemed to be his solace. He would regularly stroll the 3 1/2 miles between his brother's and sister's homes. Sometimes, he would hike all the way into Manhattan. ""He'd just walk and walk and walk,"" said a niece, Evelyn Puryear.

Over the years, the Vale of Cashmere has often been the site of attacks on gay men. Last October, two men were shot and wounded there; in 2000, a man dressed as a ninja slashed and beat five men there. No arrests were made in those attacks.

Clarence Patton, executive director of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, said he was consulted yesterday by an investigator from the Police Department's hate crimes unit, who was trying to determine whether the victim was gay.

Though Mr. Patton said he did not know, he said at least 10 percent of victims of anti-gay violence are not gay, but rather are targeted in places thought to be gathering spots for gay men or lesbians. ""It's hard to say whether you hope it was a robbery or an anti-gay attack,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, a man is dead, and it doesn't really matter.""",nytimes.com,True

Based on interviews with witnesses and confessions from three of those arrested, investigators decided that bias did not play a role in the selection of Mr. Hehman as a victim, said Deputy Inspector Michael Osgood, the commanding officer of the Police Department's Hate Crimes Unit.

""The purpose was to take his money, not to assault him because of his identity,"" he said, adding that although one of the attackers may have used racist language during the chase, that in itself did not make the incident a bias crime. ""It was a gratuitous slur,"" he said.

The events that led to Mr. Hehman's death began at 8:15 that Saturday night, when the youths, according to police, gathered on the corner of 126th Street and Lexington Avenue to plot a robbery. They quickly spotted their mark -- another man, the police said -- but backed off when a patrol car passed. A few minutes later, when Mr. Broderick emerged by the Lexington Avenue line subway station at 125th Street, the boys decided that they had found an easy target.

As part of their tactic, two of them moved in front of Mr. Hehman and three lingered behind, the police said.

For more than a week, the police were stymied in their investigation. On a hunch, they viewed surveillance tapes from a McDonald's on 125th Street that had been damaged by a group of teenagers eight days earlier. Although the police said that none of the arrested youths took part in that melee, some of those identified in the videos had heard about the attack on Mr. Hehman and led police to the suspects, who were taken into custody on Saturday.

Friends and relatives of the accused youths described them as well-behaved and unlikely participants in a violent assault. Rodney Jenkins, a grandfather of one of the 15-year-olds, said he spoiled his grandson so he would never be lured into the thuggery that upends the lives of so many young black men. ""He has a jacket for every day of the week and stack of jeans,"" Mr. Jenkins said. ""We do that so he won't have to go to the street to sell drugs.""

Diana Fox, 23, who lives across the hall from one of the 13-year-olds, said he was a bookish boy with a stutter who once helped her rid her apartment of a rat. She said, ""I can only say good things"" about him.

Mr. Hehman's father and sister, stopped as they entered their building yesterday, said they did not want to talk. According to an online profile Mr. Hehman, known to his friends as J. B., was a karaoke enthusiast, a Prince fan and self-effacingly neurotic about his health. Before his death he had been awaiting word about an internship with the city's Parks and Recreation Department. One of the last papers he turned in for his major, metropolitan studies, was about urban violence.

Norman Siegel, a civil rights lawyer and former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, expressed disappointment at the department's decision not to treat Mr. Hehman's death as a bias attack.

The 45-year-old woman, Patricia Wells, who is white, told officers that she had been attacked because she dates a black man, the police said. A small compound occupied by neo-Nazis is next door to Ms. Wells's home, and she said members of the group had previously threatened to kill her and her boyfriend.

Mr. Price became the target of the investigation based upon information developed jointly by my office and the United States Attorney's Office. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to in excess of 11 years, and Mr. Nelson was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

The bartender said that Mr. Robida had aimed the gun at him, but he said that the gun failed to fire.

The British House of Commons is to vote today on legislation that would make it an offense to incite religious hatred through the use of insulting or abusive words, The Observer of London reported. But the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill, proposed by the Labor Party, has been depicted by actors, atheists and Christians as a restriction on freedom of speech. Conservatives and Liberal Democrats also oppose it, and some Laborites may join them. Among the opponents are Nicholas Hytner, director of the National Theater; Ian McEwan, the writer; Philip Pullman, a best-selling children's writer; and the comedian Rowan Atkinson, right. Calling for rejection of the bill, Mr. Atkinson said, ""I am deeply concerned for all performers and entertainers, because the climate in which we work will be very different if the government gets its way."" Evan Harris, a Liberal Democrat spokesman, said the vote would be ""the last and best chance for Parliament to protect freedom of speech."" He said ""the chilling effect of this new offense would be to stifle free expression and set community against community -- each seeking to prosecute others for perceived insults.""

Oops!

Here was this fellow whose shoelace had become undone. And here were these priceless Qing Dynasty vases. The site was a stairway at Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England, where the three 300-year-old vases, donated in 1948, had been on display on a windowsill for 40 years. The unidentified man slipped on the shoelace, tried to steady himself as he tumbled down the stairway and brought the vases crashing down, the BBC reported. ""They are in very, very small pieces, but we are determined to put them back together,"" said Margaret Greeves, the assistant director of the museum. Duncan Robinson, director of the museum, said, ""Whilst the method of displaying objects is always under review, it is important not to overreact and make the museum's collections less accessible to the visiting public."" As for the man with the undone shoelace, a spokesman for the museum said, ""An ambulance was called, but the visitor left the museum on foot having been seen by paramedics and staff first-aiders."" Mr. Robinson said, ""It was a most unfortunate and regrettable accident, but we are glad that the visitor involved was able to leave the museum unharmed.""

Canada Reprimands Imus For Insulting Muslims

Canada's broadcasting watchdog has asserted that Don Imus, below, had been ""disparaging, insulting and abusive"" when he called Muslims ""brainwashed"" and ""stinking animals"" during a broadcast of ""Imus in the Morning"" on MSNBC Canada on Nov. 12, 2004, Reuters reported. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, which rarely judges American programs broadcast in Canada, said Mr. Imus's comments breached regulations introduced in 1990. It said it was responding in particular to a written complaint that asked why it had imposed restrictions on the distribution of Al Jazeera in Canada to forestall slurs on Jews or Israel and not placed ""similar restrictions on a service such as the American MSNBC service."" But the commission said that because MSNBC issued a formal apology in 2004 in response to complaints in the United States, it would not consider ""any restrictions on the program in question or on MSNBC in general at this time.""

Israel Reacts to 'Munich'

After months of furor over its political message, the Steven Spielberg film ""Munich"" encountered something perhaps worse when it opened in Israel over the weekend: bored critics, Reuters reported. Hostile reviews focused more on cinematic technique than on the question of sympathy toward the Palestinians who killed Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. The conservative Jerusalem Post called the film ""muddled, inept, offensive -- and boring to boot."" The liberal Haaretz said, ""There is something slovenly about the way in which Spielberg constructs the film, a slovenliness that leaks into the directing style itself.""

Those who were at the beach Thursday expressed views and attitudes, sometimes guardedly, that shed some light on the causes of the attacks. The general view was that the riots reflected not a clash of cultures, but a clash of gangs -- white Australian skinheads and neo-Nazis against young Lebanese toughs who show no respect for women or authority.

But beneath all the discussion of proximate causes, the lurking issue that Australians collectively seem to be grappling with is whether Australia is a racist country.

When the prime minister, John Howard, appeared on a current affairs television program the day after the riots, the first question was, ""If it's not racism, what is it?""

Four years ago, during a tough re-election battle, he raised fears that the country was being swamped by hordes of boat people from the Middle East, calling out the military to repel the ostensible invaders.

More recently, he has campaigned for tough antiterrorism laws by creating fears of another terrorist attack by Islamic radicals.

Still, Mr. Howard's view that this is not a racist country was shared by beachgoers here.

""I don't really see there's an underlying issue of racism in the riots,"" said Sandra Georges, a 27-year-old physical education teacher. She said the mob last Sunday was fueled by too much alcohol.

The riots' powder keg, he and others said, was an incident the previous Sunday in which Lebanese youths beat up two lifeguards. It has been described in the press as a ""bashing."" But Mr. Mejia, who said he had witnessed it, said it lasted only 30 seconds and only a few punches were thrown.

A lifeguard on duty agreed Thursday that it had been a minor incident. Only one of the lifeguards was hurt, and that was just a small cut under one eye, he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/13/opinion/13tue4.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Jamaica has a well-earned reputation for homophobia and murderous violence against gay people, most recently the murder of an internationally known AIDS outreach worker, Steve Harvey, after he was abducted from his home at gunpoint. The killing of Mr. Harvey has drawn condemnation from international organizations like Unaids and Human Rights Watch, and it should prod the Jamaican government to pay attention to the gay rights issue. The country will never defeat its AIDS epidemic -- and will continue to attract criticism from human rights organizations -- unless it takes strong steps to combat homophobia, both among the police and in society as a whole.

As depicted in published accounts, the Harvey killing has the earmarks of a hate crime. One of the armed gunmen who forced his way into Mr. Harvey's house and demanded money is said to have asked Mr. Harvey and two other men who were with him if they were gay. The two other men are said to have denied being gay, and they were bound and left at the house. Mr. Harvey was driven away and shot. His death comes a year after the high-profile murder of Brian Williamson, a well-known gay activist who was found in his home with his throat cut.

International human rights advocates have urged the Jamaican police, who have a spotty record in cases of anti-gay violence, to bring Mr. Harvey's killers to justice. But the country must go beyond this case to take a firm stance against all kinds of homophobic violence.

A good first step would be to repeal the archaic laws that implicitly sanction anti-gay violence -- and drive the AIDS epidemic -- by making sexual activities between consenting adults of the same sex illegal.",nytimes.com,True

Another proposed law, presented before the July bombings and now wending its way through Parliament, is also worrying major figures in the British arts world. The Racial and Religious Hatred Bill would punish anyone who encourages or incites such hatred. But who defines this crime: the giver or the receiver of hatred?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

""There is a new climate of religious intolerance in Britain,"" Nicholas Hytner, the director of the National Theater here, wrote in The Guardian. ""Whatever the government says, this new bill is pandering to that intolerance.""

Still, by mobilizing members of Parliament, the National Campaign for the Arts has had success persuading the government to accept some amendments to this bill, notably by clarifying that a crime of racial or religious hatred will require an intent to incite hatred or a reckless disregard for the public's response to a stated position.

The government's Commission for Racial Equality has also offered reassurance, noting that legislation will not prevent people from, say, ""telling jokes about, or making fun of religions"" or claiming that religious teachings are ""false or harmful."" The commission insists on the ""clear difference"" between criticism and incitement of hatred.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Yet if the arts world is speaking out it is because experience shows that this difference is not always clear. A year ago, Sikh protesters forced the Birmingham Repertory Theater to close a play the protesters considered offensive. Around the same time, several Christian groups denounced the BBC -- and threatened some BBC executives -- when it broadcast ""Jerry Springer: The Opera,"" which satirizes both Mr. Springer's television show and religious fanaticism.

In other words, there is a new readiness to act first rather than complain later. Before the recent opening at the National Theater of Howard Brenton's new play, ""Paul,"" about St. Paul, Mr. Hytner said he received ""a sizable mailbag of letters from people who know nothing about 'Paul,' but think it ought to be banned.""

""I will be very proud to put it on,"" he noted, then added in reference to the proposed maximum punishment for the conviction of religious hatred, ""But I am not sure I am prepared to do seven years inside for it.""

Mr. Hytner's words carry special weight because, given the weak parliamentary opposition to the Blair government, Britain's theater has become an alternative arena for political debate, through new plays by, among others, David Hare, David Edgar and Mr. Brenton, ""verbatim"" plays like ""Guantánamo"" and even revisited classics like Shakespeare's ""Richard II"" and Marlowe's ""Tamburlaine the Great.""

In practice, of course, a criminal prosecution of, for example, the National Theater would provoke an outcry. But, critics say, the effect of the proposed laws could be more insidious. The National Campaign for the Arts has cautioned that fear of prosecution could lead to self-censorship, while people or organizations financing the arts may be scared away by the risk of legal challenge.

What is apparent, not only in Britain, is that post-9/11 religious and ethnic tensions are impinging on artistic freedom.

Last year, a Dutch moviemaker, Theo van Gogh, was murdered, in apparent reprisal for a documentary that some Muslims considered blasphemous. Just this month, some conservative French legislators accused rap artists of inciting riots in several suburbs crowded with Arab and African immigrants and their children.

Anti-hatred legislation already exists in several European countries, created in most cases to fight anti-Semitism and neo-Nazi activities. Thus, France's extreme rightist leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was convicted in the 1990's for making light of the Holocaust. More recently, though, the French novelist Michel Houellebecq was acquitted of a hate crime after he described Islam as ""the most stupid religion.""

No one suggests that artists should enjoy special freedom, but they are often called on to test freedom's limits. Orhan Pamuk, the renowned Turkish novelist, is a case in point. He goes on trial later this month for daring to mention the taboo subject -- taboo in Turkey, that is -- of the mass killings of Armenians in 1915, something ""nobody but me dares to talk about,"" he told a Swiss newspaper.

Yet even where limits are not defined by the law or the courts, they can be imposed through public pressure, as was long the case with displays of gay affection onstage or on screen; through political pressure, as when the United States Congress slashed financing for the National Endowment for the Arts in the mid-1990's; or through religious pressure on artists and politicians.

What risks being forgotten is history: great art has invariably challenged convention. The bravest artists -- from Schiller and Zola to Arthur Koestler and Solzhenitsyn -- have always spoken out. Indeed, as was the case in Europe and the United States and remains the case in other parts of the world, freedom of expression has never been granted; it has always been won.

The playwright David Edgar scoffs at the idea that ""there are subjects too important, too profound, too dangerous for writing (and painting and performing and even reporting) to touch.""

The incident at the San Pablo store, caught by a video surveillance camera, involved a dozen or so black men who smashed bottles, toppled food racks and broke glass displays, the police said.

Professor Bazian said most of Oakland's liquor stores were now owned by Arab-Americans, who are among the city's newest immigrants.

Professor Bazian condemned the attacks, saying those involved had overstepped the bounds of their religion and civil society.

The sheriff's office recorded 15 racially motivated crimes in the first seven months of 2005, including vandals spray-painting ""K.K.K."" on roads and racial epithets and swastikas on roads and buildings. The county had 21 race-related crimes last year and 8 in 2003, the sheriff's office said.

Mr. Walsh, prosecutors said, had an obsession with setting fires and had worried aloud about blacks moving to Hunters Brooke. Jeremy D. Parady, another suspect, admitted in a guilty plea in April that he had singled out the development because many of the buyers were black, and a third suspect who pleaded guilty, Aaron L. Speed, had made racist statements to investigators, according to court documents. The three men are awaiting sentencing.

None of the five suspects have been charged with a hate crime, and prosecutors declined to say why, citing the coming trials for the two remaining suspects.

Some law enforcement officials said searches of the suspects' homes, computers and cars turned up no hate group or white supremacist materials or other evidence suggesting racial motives.

Prosecutors have suggested other motivations: an effort to gain notoriety for a local gang, envy of people who could afford half-million-dollar homes and revenge on the part of Mr. Speed, a former Hunters Brooke security guard, who told investigators that he was upset that his security company showed little sympathy when his infant son died.

But William Braxton, president of the Charles County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said investigators and some community leaders ""downplayed the arson as just a bunch of young boys who lost their way.""

""The African-American community is not buying that at all,"" Mr. Braxton said. ""People see within their hearts that this thing was racially motivated.""

F. Wayne Cooper, president of the five-member Charles County Board of Commissioners, said reports of possible racism as a motive have hurt the county's reputation.

""It is a poor image to set for the county,"" said Mr. Cooper, who is white. He said some residents did comment about people from ""up north"" in Prince George's County, which is predominantly black, moving to Charles and, in turn, increasing crime and worsening schools.

But Mr. Cooper said that racism did not underlie those concerns and that the county embraced newcomers of any race or ethnic background.

Members of a few white families said they believed envy, not racism, motivated the arsonists. ""They were jealous people other than them could afford these houses,"" Judy Manning, a white homeowner in Hunters Brooke, said.

Whatever the motivation, the fires disrupted lives and deferred dreams.

""Coming here was like our escape from the city, going out to the country, to raise a family here,"" said Jacque Hightower, a training officer at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Mr. Hightower, his wife and three children, who had planned to move into Hunters Brook by Dec. 8, lived in a cramped apartment in Waldorf for eight months while their house was rebuilt. ""What a Christmas present we had that year,"" Mr. Hightower said.

But if Mr. Hightower, who is black, and many others believe racism was a motivation for the arsons, that has not driven them away. Hunters Brooke residents say only one family in the community, which will ultimately have 319 homes, accepted the offer of the builder, Lennar Corporation, to back out of their contract and move elsewhere.

Charles S. Gordon, a corrections officer, said he had second thoughts about living in Hunters Brooke after the fires, even though his house was not burned. But, he said, ""If you run from racism, you'd be running the rest of your life, because racism's everywhere.""

After the arsons, some families installed home security systems, and at least one family bought guns for self-protection.

Those who have moved in say the aftermath of the arsons -- meeting their future neighbors amid charred ruins, commiserating, meeting with one another and the builder, holding a nighttime vigil -- has drawn them closer to one another.

The diversity and friendship was easy to see one Saturday afternoon. Blacks, whites, Pakistanis, Indians, Koreans and Filipinos savored the sunshine in their yards, on porches and in driveways. Teenagers gossiped on front lawns. A man hauled rocks for a patio. A woman, just moving in, unpacked boxes in her garage. Families returned from soccer and football and cheerleading practices.

One homeowner, Harold Jewett, a driver for United Parcel Service, recalled the horror of watching his house burn down on television.

But now he admires his rebuilt, airy home with a designer kitchen and two-car garage, and he smiles.

https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/19/arts/19conn.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Europe might already seem well armed. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has increased its focus on hate crimes in its Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. According to Mr. McClintock's report, the security organization also has an international hate crimes program that has been documenting its member nations' failures to document those crimes. The European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance and the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia also combat what the monitoring center calls ""racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism at the European level.""

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But Human Rights First also says that only 19 of the 55 nations in the security organization actually have hate crime legislation and that only five include ""sexual orientation and disability bias"" in their criteria. Denmark does not make racism a factor in criminal law; France does but won't separate out statistics about particular groups. As for the United States, in the latest survey 90 percent of enforcement agencies did not report data on hate crimes at all.

The report suggests that all hate crimes are vastly undercounted, noting that ""the highest levels of violence were found where there was increasingly effective monitoring and reporting (in Germany and France).""

But how are such crimes to be identified? The concept of hate crime developed only in recent decades out of a particular political perspective. It asserts that there are groups so injured by being at society's margins that any further injury rising out of hatred is particularly heinous. A hate crime is not just an individual crime but a reflection of a presumed social crime. Prosecution of hate crimes is a form of social exorcism, a declaration that traces of past sins will be expunged.

This is more peculiar than it may seem at first. Usually, a crime is prosecuted because it is a forbidden act; a hate crime is prosecuted because of a forbidden belief. Usually, punishment is assessed by judging a criminal's plans: Was the murder premeditated? Was it accidental? In hate crimes the motive is central: Was it done out of greed? Was it done out of hatred? Prosecuting hate crimes is meant to be an attack on prejudice, meant to reform feelings, not just behavior.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Thus hate crimes tend to fit a particular political ideology. It is not really group hatred that gives hate crimes their meaning, but social grievance. In the United States, for example, there is palpable discomfort when an incident of black-on-white crime is called a hate crime. It doesn't fit the model: where's the victim's social grievance? Anti-Semitism has also typically been seen as the spur to a hate crime only when it comes from the far right, as an extension of familiar fascistic victimization.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Human Rights First refers to terrorist acts as spurring hate crimes in retaliation but not as hate crimes themselves. They are ignored even though the Washington sniper of 2003, John Allen Muhammad, made his group hatred apparent, and even though radical Islamic clerics regularly preach hatred against Jews, infidels and Westerners and urge that it be acted upon (with considerable success). These are not considered hate crimes because the victims are not considered socially aggrieved.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In fact, debates about hate crimes can even resemble debates over who merits social restitution. This report urges that the concept be standardized: hate crimes should be crimes based on prejudice motivated by race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and disability.

Given all this, it is not surprising that statistics are inconsistent and difficult to come by, that some hate crimes prove to be crimes committed for other motives, that some hate crimes are not crimes at all and that others go unrecognized. Hate crimes are hard to prove and easy to claim, related to feelings not acts. It is not clear that monitoring and reporting will eliminate hate crimes. More agencies and legal structures are now devoted to them than ever before, without diminishing their prevalence.

Is it possible that one of the best ways to eliminate hate crimes is to jettison the concept itself? As for eliminating acts of hatred well, that is a more serious problem.

As Mr. Moore and his friends walked away, Mr. Schicchi handed Nicolas Morse, 19, a baseball bat, Mr. DiBenedetto said. Mr. Goldberg then brandished an ice scraper at Mr. Moore and his friends ""and the chase escalated from a walk to a sprint.""

While his friends escaped, Mr. Moore did not, the prosecutor said, and he suffered injuries to his head, chest, arms, hips and ankle.

Mr. Schicchi's lawyer, Steven Frankel, denied that his client handed Mr. Morse the bat, and said that there were a half dozen people on the stoop who would testify that he did not.

Mr. Goldberg's lawyer, Mark S. Cossuto, said that his client, was not accused of hitting anyone.

On Aug. 16, the police arrested Robert Lombardi, 18, Anthony David, 17, and Stephen Cucarese, 18, and Anthony Capone, 17, all of Flatlands or Mill Basin as well as Mr. Morse, whom the police identified as the ringleader of the gang.

https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/09/nyregion/09bias.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"The police said yesterday that they were looking for 5 to 10 young white men believed to be from Flatlands or nearby areas of Brooklyn as suspects in an assault and robbery early Sunday morning of a black man who said he had been called a racial slur.

In what the authorities said they were approaching as a possible hate crime, the man, Alex Moore, 29, said he had been set upon after leaving a friend's house in Flatlands, a racially and ethnically diverse area, by a group of whites who jumped out of a van or sport utility vehicle at Avenue N and East 59th Street.

According to the police, the attackers swung at least one baseball bat and an iron pipe and stole at least $50 from Mr. Moore. They piled back into their vehicle and sped off after a black couple driving by stopped and the man yelled at them.

Mr. Moore, who suffered injuries to the head, chest, arms, hip and ankle, was treated at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, which he left Sunday night, apparently against the advice of doctors. ""He was supposed to be here"" yesterday, said a hospital spokesman, Andrew Rubin.",nytimes.com,True

The attackers shouted at him to mind his own business, she said. As the couple drew near, though, they broke off the attack. Investigators said the couple's approach interrupted the beating and apparently spared Mr. Moore more serious injuries.

The attackers -- as many as six teenagers or men in their early 20's who rode in a van or sport utility vehicle -- sped away before police officers arrived.

No weapons were recovered at the scene. Mr. Moore was taken to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with bruises of the head, chest, arms and hip caused by blunt trauma, and a severe ankle laceration. He was released late last night.

The assault -- six weeks after a group of white men attacked three black men in Howard Beach, Queens, severely beating one with a baseball bat -- sent tremors of shock through Flatlands, a quiet neighborhood of shops and one- and two-family homes near Brooklyn's south shore, where Jews, Italians, African-Americans and Caribbean immigrants share a generally peaceful, integrated life.

The Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, who visited Mr. Moore in the hospital, said he had appointed a special assistant to head his investigation and vowed to allow no plea bargains and to seek the law's heaviest penalties if the assailants were caught. First-degree bias assault convictions are punishable by at least eight years in prison, as opposed to five-year minimums for regular assaults.

According to the police, who interviewed Mr. Moore in the hospital as well as the couple who went to his aid, the victim had visited a friend in the Flatlands area on Saturday night and was walking to his home on Atkins Avenue in East New York, about four miles away, when the attack occurred, apparently without provocation.

Mr. Moore's route took him along Avenue N, a commercial strip of one- and two-story buildings with small businesses. A jewelry store, a shoe repair shop, a dentist's office and a vacuum cleaner store occupy the corners at East 59th Street, and all were closed for the night.

Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, visited Mr. Moore in the hospital and quoted him as saying that a van or sport utility vehicle passed him, then made an abrupt U-turn and halted. Several white men leaped out, converged on the victim and began punching, kicking and swinging what investigators for the police bias-crime unit said was at least one baseball bat and one iron pipe.

""The next thing he knew he was clobbered,"" Mr. Markowitz said.

The passing middle-aged couple were driving home from an evening of dinner and dancing and pulled over when they saw what was happening. The police did not identify them because they are witnesses to a crime, but the wife agreed to an anonymous interview, citing a fear of reprisals. She said she and her husband had not thought about their own safety in getting out to confront the attackers.

After the assailants fled, the couple helped Mr. Moore, who was dazed and bloody, limp to their car. He crawled into the back seat, she said, cradling his head in his hands. ""I didn't do anything,"" she quoted him as saying. ""They just attacked me.""

The woman called 911, and the couple waited with Mr. Moore until the police arrived.

Yesterday, as the police canvassed the neighborhood in search of anyone who might have seen or heard the attack or who might know anything about the assailants, the area was quiet again, with the peace of a summer Sunday in the air. But the attack was the talk of the neighborhood.

""That's something that doesn't really happen around here -- most of the time it's quiet,"" said Marvin Edward, 20, a Flatlands resident. Of the victim, he said, ""I hope he gets better fast,"" and, referring to the assailants: ""Put them in jail. That's the best thing to do with them.""

Mr. Hynes, the district attorney who was the special prosecutor in the 1986 Howard Beach racial assault case in which whites chased a black man to his death on a highway, said after visiting Mr. Moore that he had appointed Lance Ogiste, a special assistant, to head his office's investigation, and he called it a clear case of hate crime.

The assembly's coordinator, Susie Tanenbaum, said no other borough had anything to match it, which seems fitting, since Queens is by some measures unmatched in its diversity: 46.1 percent of the borough's residents were born abroad.

The assembly has no legal powers, so its achievements since it was started in February 2003 are somewhat intangible. But most crucial, many delegates and former delegates say, is how the meetings have deepened their understanding of unfamiliar cultures.

""When I see them eat outside their house in a small shelter, that's because in the old times they didn't have a shelter,"" is how Mr. Bains, a postal supervisor in Jamaica, explained the practice.

Mr. Pinter, who had scarcely met any Sikhs before, said he has learned that their religion, which is influenced by both Hinduism and Islam, is ""fairly moderate"" and ""not at all like the Jihadists."" Indeed, Mr. Bains, he said, is not very different from his own father, an immigrant who escaped from Nazi Germany in 1939 and became a civil engineer.

""Just yesterday, an Afghan woman called me to say she's being exploited by her employer at a supermarket,"" she said, saying that the woman was getting paid less than the market's Korean workers.

In an interview, Ms. Marshall said her idea for the assembly very much had the United Nations in mind, particularly because the world body held its first meetings in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in 1946. Another inspiration was her own cosmopolitan life, including her Guyanese heritage, her attendance at a camp run by a largely Jewish settlement house in the Bronx and participation in battles in northern Queens for school integration.

In recent years, the borough's increasingly polyglot character persuaded her that a way was needed to introduce people of various ethnicities to one another, she said.

She made sure that the assembly also represented all of its neighborhoods, so there are two members from each of Queens' 14 community districts.

One of them, Madhulika S. Khandelwal, an Indian immigrant who directs the Asian/American Center at Queens College, asked the delegates to describe their insights into other groups. Bess DeBethama, a black delegate from Cambria Heights, told of how simply talking to each other eased tensions between the black residents of Cambria Heights and the Hasidim visiting the grave of the Lubavitcher rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.

A crowd gathered, some standing on the railings of the bridge that now spans the ford to get a better view.

Mr. Brooks, drawing from witness accounts and investigative files, spoke through a megaphone, related how the four victims were dragged from a car and down to the riverbank, where they were shot to death.

Eleven days later, Loy Harrison, a prosperous white farmer, bailed him out at the request of his family, taking with him Mr. Malcom's wife, Dorothy; his sister, Mae Murray Dorsey; and her husband, George.

Mr. Minucci, who was on probation for the attack on Mr. Rich at the time of the Howard Beach attack, faces up to four years in prison if he is found to have violated his probation, a law enforcement official said. The official asked not to be named because the 2002 case is sealed, as Mr. Minucci was a juvenile at the time.

Mr. Moore, who suffered a fractured skull in the beating and was in critical condition after the attack, was in stable condition yesterday at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. Two men, Nicholas Minucci, 19, who was accused of wielding the bat, and Anthony Ench, 21, have been charged with assault as a hate crime, while a third man, Frank Agostini, 20, has not been charged and may be treated as a witness.

In the days since the attack, supporters of the white men have emphasized that at least one of the black men told the police that he went to Howard Beach that night to steal a car, and Mr. Agostini has insisted that he was the first to encounter the black men and, fearing that he was about to be robbed, ran to get Mr. Minucci and Mr. Ench. The police, however, have emphasized that no crime was committed before the attack.

In the most recent incident, the police said, Mr. Wood, 20, of Brownsville, and a male accomplice carrying a semiautomatic handgun accosted an 18-year-old man on a westbound A train as it approached the station at Pitkin and Grant Avenues in East New York at 9:40 p.m. Sunday.

Mr. Orellana later told the police that he thought the weapon was a pellet gun and that he scoffed at the threat. The gunman, however, drew back the slide, ejecting a live round to show that the gun was real, and Mr. Orellana quickly surrendered his wallet. The assailant identified as Mr. Wood then ripped a chain off Mr. Orellana's neck, investigators said.

Next, the robbers demanded that the teenager hand over a pair of new sneakers he was carrying in a bag. Mr. Orellana pleaded to keep the shoes. ""He said words to the effect of 'You took my wallet, you ripped my chain, please let me keep my sneakers,' and they complied,"" an investigator said.

As the train pulled into the station, the two assailants got off but told Mr. Orellana to stay aboard, and even pushed him back inside as the doors closed, the police said. He got off at the next stop, at Pitkin and Euclid Avenues, where he saw a transit officer and reported the robbery.

A team of transit officers, accompanied by Mr. Orellana, canvassed the neighborhood and spotted Mr. Wood standing with a group of four to five men at Pine Street and Blake Avenue, nine blocks from where they had left the victim. At the arraignment, an assistant district attorney, Carolyn Kelly Lada, said that Mr. Wood had changed his clothes but that Mr. Orellana recognized his face, hair and a distinctive earring. Mr. Wood was taken into custody at 10:25 p.m.

Asked about the family's accusation, Paul J. Browne, the deputy police commissioner for public information, said, ""We're investigating this as a robbery and not a hoax.""

The police have said that the recent Howard Beach attack, in its racial overtones and in some of its circumstances, with whites chasing black men, bore similarities to the 1986 Howard Beach case in which a mob of white teenagers chased three black men whose car had broken down in their neighborhood. One of the black men fled onto a highway, where he was killed by a passing car.

But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other officials, while pledging to pursue justice in hate crimes vigorously, have also drawn careful distinctions between the two attacks. The 1986 attacks occurred at a time of racial turbulence in New York and led to emotionally charged demonstrations led by the Rev. Al Sharpton and others. Mr. Sharpton led another protest last week, on the Fourth of July, but it was not comparable to those of two decades ago.

As investigators have pursued various threads of the latest case, it has yielded a more complex picture of what happened. The authorities have noted that Mr. Moore was convicted in a car theft case in 2003 and was in Howard Beach at 3 a.m. with two friends, one of whom, Richard S. Pope, 25, said he was there on the prowl for a car to steal.

At the same time, there was scant sympathy, even among Howard Beach residents, for Mr. Minucci, who has been accused as the main attacker.

Lori Zeno, a court-appointed lawyer for Mr. Minucci, has argued that the attack on Mr. Moore came after he and his friends threatened her client. She said they put a screwdriver to his neck and tried to rob him. The police recovered some tools but not a screwdriver from the scene.

Mr. Pope and Mr. Wood said that they were chased by white men who got out of a car. They said that they hid near a church, but that Mr. Moore tripped and was beaten by the bat-wielder, who shouted racial epithets, took two pairs of sneakers from him and ripped an earring from his ear. The police and civil rights advocates have argued that the viciousness of the attack could not be justified by any threats, as Mr. Minucci's lawyer contends.",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Sharpton had said last week that he was planning a march through Howard Beach. It was unclear whether yesterday's convoy was the event he had had in mind, but he repeatedly said that he wanted the residents of Howard Beach, and not his supporters, to conduct a march.

In stark contrast to protests that followed an attack on three black men in Howard Beach in 1986, when more than 1,000 protesters marched through the neighborhood and were met by 100 or so people screaming abuse, Mr. Sharpton's journey yesterday was met with restrained annoyance by residents. A handful of teenagers wore T-shirts that read ""Free Ench,"" referring to one of the men being held in the attack.

Echoing a sentiment expressed by many residents, Mrs. Rubin questioned the publicity the beating has attracted, noting that a 15-year-old, Christopher Rose, was killed on Saturday, apparently for his iPod.

Mr. Sharpton, whose group included Mr. Moore's relatives and friends, asked yesterday why prosecutors had not yet charged Mr. Agostini, who has admitted to investigators that he participated in the attack on Mr. Moore.

The two other men who authorities say attacked Mr. Moore -- Nicholas Minucci, 19, and Anthony Ench, 21, have been charged with assault as a hate crime, and are being held without bail.

""Howard Beach has an opportunity to reinvent itself by how they respond to what was done to Glenn Moore,"" Mr. Sharpton said. ""We hope that the good people, the people that have shown Howard Beach can change, will stand up and do a march.""

The convoy yesterday left Jamaica Medical Center led by a group of a dozen bikers, including Mr. Eison. Their motorcycles roared along the Van Wyck Expressway, shepherding Mr. Sharpton's convoy toward Lindenwood, occasionally stopping traffic.

Mr. Eison declined to give his stepson's exact address. Friends of Mr. Moore said last week that he split his time between his girlfriend's apartment on Pine Street in East New York, and an apartment he rents, where he lives alone.

For part of the journey, Richard A. Pope, one of Mr. Moore's two companions from the night of the attack, joined Mr. Eison as a passenger on the back of his motorcycle. Mr. Pope, who has said that he alone intended to steal a car the night he was attacked, declined to be interviewed yesterday, and kept himself a good distance from the throng that surrounded Mr. Sharpton.

As the riders left Howard Beach, they revved their engines, an earsplitting departure that further angered residents, who applauded as the convoy rode off, some of them saying ""So long, Al"" and others making racially derisive comments.",nytimes.com,True

They were attacked by a gang of white youths who were enraged by their mere presence.

Mr. Griffith was struck by a car and killed as he ran onto a highway in an effort to flee the gang.

That incident ignited a prolonged period of turmoil that severely aggravated the already raw nerves of race relations in the city. Public officials, including the Queens district attorney, John Santucci, clashed openly with lawyers for the surviving victims. Eventually a special state prosecutor, Charles Hynes, who is now the Brooklyn district attorney, was named to handle the case.

That was New York then, when subway fares were a dollar, crime was out of control, and Gimbels was bidding the world adieu.

The city is a different and a better place these days. Mayor Michael Bloomberg could not have responded faster to last week's attack if he had been wearing Rollerblades.

(He drives a $60,000 Cadillac S.U.V. and likes to cruise around flashing gold necklaces, Rolexes and other expensive bling.) The attack was deemed a hate crime, and Mr. Minucci was charged with first-degree assault. An alleged accomplice, Anthony Ench, 21, was also arrested, and a third man is being questioned.

The current Queens district attorney, Richard Brown, made it clear that anyone charged in the case would be vigorously prosecuted. And the Rev.

A singular development in New York over the past several years, accelerated by the terrible experience of Sept. 11, 2001, has been a willingness to move beyond the chronic ethnic conflict and divisiveness of previous eras.

We may not be approaching nirvana, and Howard Beach can hardly be characterized as a haven of racial tolerance. But there are very few New Yorkers interested in revisiting the searing ethnic face-offs of the past.

Mr. Sharpton, who had lunch with several public officials in Howard Beach on Friday, said that ""the tone of the city has changed -- as I have changed"" in 19 years and that this incident should not be allowed to spiral out of control or overshadow the substantial progress the city has made.

He said he was concerned about the attack, which is why he went to Howard Beach. But he pointedly noted, ""We're not fighting for the right to steal cars.""

Mr. Bloomberg, polls show, does not engender the hostility of an Edward I. Koch or a Rudolph W. Giuliani, and the current police commissioner enjoys considerable standing among blacks and Latinos. The nature of the city -- ever more integrated by ever more immigrants -- has changed, and polls show that many New Yorkers believe that racial tensions are low. Crime, which made the city more of a tinderbox in the 1980's, is at its lowest point since the 1960's.

""In 1986,"" Mr. Koch said, ""there were people who were looking to escalate racial tensions and to take advantage of any incident and make it worse."" He added, ""I don't think Al Sharpton today is the Al Sharpton of 1986 who wanted to escalate it.""

Mr. Sharpton made clear he thought the changes went well beyond him. ""The tone of the city is different today,"" he said. ""The fact that this happened before makes all of us approach this wiser than when we were a city of strangers. We may not all be on the same page, but we know the book.""

It was a scene that would have been all but unthinkable 20 years ago.

Then, a confluence of factors practically assured that any racial events would touch a much deeper nerve. Whites had been slowly losing their majority status in the city, and felt threatened as more neighborhoods hit a tipping point as minorities moved in. Crime, bolstered by the crack epidemic, was increasingly adding to the sense of insecurity about a city out of control. And a series of explosive events -- crystallized by Bernhard Goetz's shooting of four black teenagers he thought were about to mug him on the subway -- heightened festering tensions between the races.

The 1986 Howard Beach attack was sandwiched between the unprovoked murders of two black men in white neighborhoods in Brooklyn: Willie Turks, a black transit worker who was killed when he had stopped at a bagel store in Gravesend, and Yusuf K. Hawkins, who was slain by a group of whites in Bensonhurst while he was shopping for a used car.

As a white enclave in an increasingly multiethnic borough, the Howard Beach of 1986 was an island in a sea of demographic change. Indeed, in 1986, voters in the district that included Howard Beach elected the borough's first black congressman. Surrounding neighborhoods, like South Ozone Park, were increasingly drawing immigrants.

So when the car of three black men broke down one night in December 1986, and they wandered to a Howard Beach pizzeria, the stage was set. A gang of whites attacked them, and one was chased to his death in traffic on the Belt Parkway. Mr. Sharpton, distrustful of the ability of Queens officials to vigorously pursue the case, demanded a special prosecutor and would not allow the surviving victims to cooperate with investigators.

Indeed, back then, Jim Sleeper, an author who writes about racial issues, recalled that a black friend defended the refusal of lawyers representing the victims of the Howard Beach attack to cooperate with prosecutors, saying: ""This isn't about fairness and intellectual integrity. It's about power.""

That power was manifested in the appointment of Charles J. Hynes as a special prosecutor to pursue the Howard Beach case, a political triumph for Mr. Sharpton.

The racial maneuvering that dominated the headlines in the wake of the killing roiled a city that was in the grips of change. Sometime in the 1980's, New York became a majority-minority city. Those changes were reverberating politically, and in 1989, New Yorkers elected a black candidate, David N. Dinkins, as mayor for the first time, after he pledged to heal the city of its racial divisions.

Now, Queens has a black borough president. And where there was once widespread black mistrust of law enforcement, that is slowly changing. This year, a majority of the latest graduates of the Police Academy are from one minority group or another.

In 1988, a New York Times poll found that only 25 percent of New Yorkers and 19 percent of blacks said that race relations in the city were generally good. In 2002, 63 percent of New Yorkers did, including 53 percent of blacks.

Since the first Howard Beach attack, the police and prosecutors, armed with new powers, have focused more on hate crimes. In recent years, at most two bias crimes against blacks have been reported annually in the 106th Precinct, which includes Howard Beach. Citywide, the number recorded dropped to 27 last year from 45 in 2001.

""Race is still involved,"" said Andrew Hacker, a Queens College government professor, ""but the race I would focus on is a group of young, white New Yorkers who haven't kept up with your demanding times. They are 'losers,' and white losers have always been the sort who try to get their manhood by turning on blacks.""

The political tone of the city has also changed. In 1986, Mayor Koch, still reeling from municipal corruption scandals that happened under his watch, denounced the Howard Beach assailants as a ""lynch mob."" But to some blacks, his oratory was overcompensating for perceived insensitivity to minorities. Any overtures by the mayor to blacks were undercut by his mandate to reduce spending -- epitomized by his closing of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem. Mr. Koch, at times, seemed to embody the polarization that characterized disputes ranging from school decentralization, low-income housing and police brutality.

""There was anger in the black community because the city was cutting its budget and the people who suffer the most are the poor and the people who are the poorest are black and Hispanic,"" Mr. Koch said this week. ""Today the atmosphere is different. Even the disparity in black unemployment is much less. People feel better about the chances of success for their children. People have evolved, and those who haven't are not acceptable to their own communities. And you have a mayor who is perceived by everybody as someone who isn't interested in color.""

Mr. Dinkins, who was mayor when tensions escalated into violence between blacks and Hasidic Jews in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, credited Mr. Bloomberg with the improved climate. ""It's a vastly different city under this administration than in 1986,"" he said Thursday in a telephone interview from London, where he was watching the Wimbledon tennis tournament. But, referring to Mr. Koch and Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Dinkins added, ""although I am not suggesting Ed was anything like Rudy in race relations.""

Many say that Mr. Bloomberg has gone far to defuse lingering racial tensions from the Giuliani years. Despite the decline in crime in neighborhoods under Mr. Giuliani, the police were viewed as heavy-handed and were criticized by blacks for engaging in racial profiling. His tenure was punctuated by several cases, including the shooting of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx and the assault by police officers on Abner Louima in a Brooklyn station house.

In 2000, a Times poll found that only 3 percent of black voters in New York City said Mr. Giuliani cared about the needs and problems of people like them. In a Times poll completed last week, 51 percent of blacks said Mr. Bloomberg cared.

No one can say how the latest Howard Beach event will reverberate. Mr. Sharpton plans to announce on Monday or Tuesday a march in Howard Beach, possibly next weekend.

Despite the progress in race relations, black and white leaders said, the latest event is nonetheless leading some in the black community to vent concerns that they feel City Hall and others have not solved.

""People say race no longer influences the future of this city, but of course it does,"" Mr. Sharpton said. ""Politicians still have to face up to race. There are black men who don't have jobs. There is crime, there are hate crimes. It may not be the same city as in '86, but race is still very alive as an issue.""

C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president and the only major black candidate in the mayoral race, concurred that the turmoil in Howard Beach should lead to citywide debate and action about the need for more jobs, particularly for minorities and the poor, and the persistence of racial and ethnic segregation in neighborhoods, housing projects and public schools.

The meeting of furrowed brows could finally begin, but now Howard Beach had to wait for its conclusion and, again, for Mr. Sharpton. The sun scowled, the air reeked, and things began to be said and done on Cross Bay Boulevard.

""He wants it all!"" she shouted.

Her words emboldened other women of Howard Beach to speak up. They said that this wasn't 1986, that people respect one another, and that a recent spate of black-on-white crimes in their neighborhood was receiving nowhere near the same attention.

Sandy Adovic, 40, agreed. ""He went a little overboard,"" she said of Mr. Minucci. ""But that's about it.""

The women of Howard Beach took a cigarette break in the restaurant's narrowing shade; their green room. An aide for Anthony D. Weiner -- congressman, mayoral candidate and meeting attendee -- kept a scorecard of media outlets present. A restaurant worker stepped into the heat to ask the crowd not to block the entrance. ""I have lunch customers; I have a kids' party,"" she said. ""The kids are getting nervous.""

The long, steamy wait seemed to be getting to some people. Ms. Prosa ranted about the lack of diversity in Mr. Sharpton's staff -- ""Not a white person do I see in there! Not even a Hispanic!"" -- while a woman in the Dunkin' Donuts said she'd like to punch Mr. Sharpton in the face.

SOON two young men came strutting down the boulevard with military purpose. The taller, stouter one sported a ""Free Fat Nick"" sign taped carefully to his blue T-shirt. His hunched companion just popped Dot candies into his mouth.

The stout one handed out ""Free Fat Nick"" signs, but demurred when asked his name; he clearly desired that his missionary work for Mr. Minucci be done anonymously. Meanwhile, a young woman confided, ""I know people that have pictures of him on their dashboard.""

When Mr. Sharpton finally emerged, then, to speak of a ""very positive and very open"" meeting, he still stood in a place where an unemployed miscreant can be seen by some as a martyr: ""Fat Nick"" Minucci, who swung a bat so that others might live in peace.",nytimes.com,True
https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/01/nyregion/01attack.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Mr. Minucci was arraigned yesterday on charges of first-degree assault as a hate crime in the attack, and he faces a minimum of eight years in prison. The victim, Mr. Moore, 22, was in stable condition at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center with a fractured skull.

The man arrested yesterday, Anthony Ench, 21, has been charged with assault as a hate crime and robbery in the case, officials said. Another man, Frank Agostini, 20, was also taken into custody yesterday. Mr. Agostini came forward with his father, a police detective, and is likely to be treated as a witness, the police said.

The Rev. Al Sharpton and Mr. Moore's lawyer, Derek Sells, met yesterday with Mr. Moore's family, and they characterized the attackers as a ""lynch mob."" They also objected to police statements that Mr. Moore was with two friends who came to the predominantly white neighborhood intending to steal a car.

Mr. Sharpton said he planned to conduct a protest march through Howard Beach in the next few days; similar rallies he organized after a 1989 racial killing in Bensonhurst were met with racial taunts from local residents.

In a sign of how the racial climate has changed in the city from 20 years ago, Mr. Sharpton, who had demanded a special prosecutor after the 1986 attack in Howard Beach, praised the mayor's handling of this week's attack.

""The city cannot go back to the '80s,"" said Mr. Sharpton, whom the mayor contacted personally late Wednesday night to discuss the attack. ""We think that the tone set by the mayor is good.""

His words came as welcome relief to the mayor and his aides. Mr. Bloomberg had briefly considered canceling his trip to Los Angeles and Singapore to lobby for the city's selection as the site for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but as of last night he was planning to go. Even though the mayor at one point cut off a reporter's question he took to be about politics -- saying ""I don't think this is a good day for politics"" -- he and his aides were painfully aware that this is an election year, and racial incidents have altered the dynamics of at least two recent mayoral contests.

The four Democratic candidates for the mayoral election were quick to condemn the attack, but only one, C. Virginia Fields, who is black, criticized the mayor, saying he was ""treating this attack as an isolated incident, when the city has seen far too many hate crimes in recent years."" Aides to another candidate, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, said Mr. Miller was likely to attend Mr. Sharpton's rally.

In Howard Beach, some white residents interviewed raised questions about why the young black men were in the neighborhood, repeating police reports that two had said they were there to steal a car. At the same time, the residents expressed revulsion at the attack.

But Richard S. Pope, who was with Mr. Moore when the attack occurred, said in an interview that he was the only one who intended to steal a car that evening, insisting that his friends knew nothing about it. He said the white men shouted racial epithets as he chased Mr. Moore down.

Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday morning that the police had yet to ask Mr. Moore about the possibility of car theft and whether he knew anything about it. Mr. Moore was indicted in July 2003 on charges of unauthorized use of a vehicle, among other counts, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of possessing stolen property and was sentenced in February 2004 to 30 days to a year in jail, according to a law enforcement official.

Officials said that in his statement to the police, Mr. Minucci said the confrontation began when Mr. Moore and his friends encountered him at a Italian deli.

In the written statement, Mr. Minucci said, ""I saw black kids walking up the block and I heard them say, 'Look at that little white boy right there,""' and that ""one of them pushed me into a wall and one held my head against the wall and one put a screwdriver to my neck."" He said they asked him for a chain and watch he had been wearing earlier.

He claimed that part of the confrontation ended without incident. Then, Mr. Minucci said he returned with friends to confront Mr. Moore and his companions with a baseball bat. Mr. Minucci said Mr. Moore tripped and fell while fleeing, bashing his own head. He added that he had only used the bat to whack Mr. Moore's legs to keep him from fleeing while awaiting the police.

At Mr. Minucci's arraignment yesterday, when he was ordered held without bail, his court-appointed lawyer, Lori Zeno, echoed Mr. Minucci's statements that the confrontation started as a robbery. ""When they saw my client standing next to his $60,000 car,"" Ms. Zeno said, referring to Mr. Minucci's Cadillac Escalade, ""they decided to put a screwdriver to his neck to try to rob him.""

But Commissioner Kelly said he believed Mr. Minucci ""fabricated a story,"" and another police official said Mr. Minucci gave varying accounts, at first saying he was asleep at the time of the attack and had no idea what detectives were talking about when they questioned him.

Doctors said Mr. Moore's condition indicated that he was attacked. Yesterday afternoon, an official at Jamaica Hospital said he had a bone injury that was affecting his hearing. ""This is consistent with injury from a baseball bat, not a fall to the pavement,"" said Geoffrey Doughlin, chairman of emergency medicine at the hospital.

Mr. Ench, who the police said accompanied Mr. Minucci as he attacked Mr. Moore and helped steal some of his belongings -- Air Jordan sneakers and a shopping bag said to contain Prada dress shoes -- was convicted of disorderly conduct earlier this year, a police official said.

Paul J. Browne, a deputy police commissioner, said the police had recovered a hammer, nails and pliers at the attack scene but ""there was no screwdriver.""

Mr. Minucci was on probation at the time of the attack on an assault charge, a law enforcement official said. Among the conditions of his probation, this person said, was that he attend anger management classes.

Last night, a crowd of more than two dozen of Mr. Minucci's and Mr. Ench's friends and family gathered outside Mr. Ench's house on 77th Street, venting anger over the charges and saying they were not a prejudiced crowd. They pointed to the Hispanics and one black teenager, saying ""We have a U.N. here.""",nytimes.com,True

Both were out that night, as they were many nights, with friends who had criminal records. Each had had brushes with the law, and the two may even have had an earlier brush with each other.

Such similarities are not unusual in outbreaks of street violence, and in the hands of each side's partisans, they can be used to smudge the boundary between attacker and victim. Even in the notorious Howard Beach attack of 1986, when a black man died after being chased by a group of white men, neighbors of the defendants tried to shift culpability by pointing out that the victim had had cocaine in his system.

Yesterday, some defenders of Mr. Minucci said the attack was justified; they said they believed that Mr. Moore and his friends had been roaming the neighborhood for something to steal. ""They are low-life animals,"" said Chris Ruiz, 19, a friend of Mr. Minucci's.

The picture that has emerged of Mr. Minucci is clearer than that of Mr. Moore. Muscle-bound, with closely cropped hair, Mr. Minucci -- who is known as Fat Nick -- was described by friends, neighbors and relatives as reveling in the image of a young man leading the thug life. In fact, his friendship with the children of Victoria Gotti was well known in the neighborhood.

""He is friends with all three sons,"" said a neighbor who would identify himself only as Larry. ""They would go on camping trips.""

Friends and neighbors said Mr. Minucci had a walk-on role in at least one episode of the TV show ""Growing Up Gotti,"" in which he encouraged one of the Gotti sons to get a tattoo, saying it would make him a man.

Mr. Minucci did not graduate from high school, and the only job his friends and family recall him having was a brief stint making deliveries for a local bakery. Mr. Minucci told investigators that he sold his route for tens of thousands of dollars and used a large portion of that money to buy his $60,000 Cadillac Escalade, which was registered to a family member, according to Brian E. Kohm, an assistant Queens district attorney.

Mr. Minucci grew up in Lindenwood, which borders Howard Beach, and still lives there with his family on a quiet, tree-lined street of two- and three-story brick houses. His uncle, Anthony Minucci, said he played Little League baseball as a boy.

Nicholas Minucci's first run-in with the law came when he was 15, on the night of the 2001 terror attack, when he and a young man were arrested after shooting paintballs at Sikhs as they came out of the Sikh Cultural Center in Richmond Hill, Queens, said several law enforcement officials who insisted on anonymity because Mr. Minucci was a juvenile at the time and the case record was sealed. The officials said he was found in a car with a paintball gun and a bat.

A year later, Mr. Minucci and a friend, Frank Ambrosio, got into a fight with another Howard Beach teenager, John J. Rich, 15, who was stabbed. The two friends were charged, but before Mr. Rich could testify in the trial, he was killed by an elevated subway train, falling onto the tracks in what the police determined was an accident.

""I heard Nick Minucci threw a party when John died because he thought he was going to beat the charges,"" said Mr. Rich's uncle, William O'Connor. In the end, Mr. Minucci pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to five years of probation, according to a law enforcement official who insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.

Even while on probation, Mr. Minucci continued to live a lush life. Friends said his grandfather lavished gifts on him. During the attack on Wednesday, Mr. Minucci was wearing a Rolex watch worth $6,000 and a necklace worth $4,000, said Mr. Kohm, the Queens prosecutor.

Mr. Minucci admitted that he had attacked Mr. Moore and that a friend had shouted racial epithets, the police said. But in a statement, Mr. Minucci denied any racial motive. All of his friends and relatives who were interviewed yesterday said he was not racist.

Lauren Wright, 33, a cousin of Anthony Ench, who was with Mr. Minucci during the attack and surrendered to the police yesterday, noted that her husband is black. ""We come from a culturally diverse family,"" she said. ""These same guys had been coming into the neighborhood and robbing people. It didn't have anything to do with anybody's skin color.""

But Mr. Moore's mother, Chandra Eison, said her son was just visiting his girlfriend, Andrea Gordon, and their 6-month old daughter, Amiyh. After leaving her apartment, he met up with two friends, including Richard S. Pope, who said in an interview that he had gone to the neighborhood that night to steal a car. He said Mr. Moore was not aware of his plan.

Mr. Moore's mother said he had no reason to steal, and was about to receive a settlement for a car accident he had been in as a child. Mr. Moore, who was 9 at the time, suffered seizures afterward, said a friend who would not give his name.

Ms. Eison described her son as an average student who played basketball in high school and was not sure what he would do for a living. Among his friends, she said, he was the only one to graduate, and when approached by an Army recruiter he decided to join up in 2000.

Friends said he trained to drive tanks, but he was discharged a year later after injuring his finger, and received disability payments.

""He has been kind of confused, and recently he has been between careers,"" she said.

In July 2003 he was accused of trying to steal a car and pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property, a misdemeanor that carried no jail time.

He was hanging out more and more on what his friends referred to as ""the block,"" a corner on Blake Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn. ""He did not want a penny-ante job,"" his mother said. She said the birth of his daughter encouraged him to get serious about his life again, so he could take care of his family.

When he was attacked, he was carrying the little girl's sneakers, Air Jordans that he planned to hang on the wall with the rest of his Air Jordan collection, his mother said.

It remains unclear when Mr. Minucci and Mr. Moore first encountered each other; Mr. Minucci said that the black men had tried to rob him earlier that night. But no matter what Mr. Moore or his friends were doing in Howard Beach, Ms. Eison said, there was no excuse for what happened. After visiting her son at the hospital, she said: ""I am so tired. I am exhausted at this situation.""",nytimes.com,True

He died when he was struck by a car. That assault ignited a furor in the city, leading to the appointment of a special prosecutor and laying bare a degree of racial tension in New York that would reverberate for years.

Four white men from Howard Beach were tried, and three were convicted on manslaughter and assault charges and sent to prison. The fourth defendant, a 16-year-old, was acquitted of all charges. The episode and the ensuing unrest made Howard Beach all but synonymous with racial discord, and played out as a charged political and social drama for months.

The details in the new attack, which were still emerging last night, appeared to be in some ways more complicated. Mr. Minucci, the accused, said that the three black men might have been looking at his jewelry earlier last week, and that he was responding to that when he came across them around 3 a.m. yesterday. For their part, two of the black men, according to police, admitted under questioning that they had been in the area with hopes of stealing a car.

But one law enforcement official said that at the time of the attack, the black men had done nothing more than be in Howard Beach around 3 a.m. And another official said that Mr. Minucci told investigators that after the beating, his companion said, ""This is what you get if you want to rob white boys,"" finishing the sentence with a racial epithet.

""Crimes motivated by ethnic or racial bias, particularly those involving violence, can never be tolerated,"" the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said.

In 2004, Mr. Minucci pleaded guilty to assault in an unrelated case. In that case, he was charged with stabbing a 15-year-old outside a Broad Channel bar in 2002, but the defendant in that case died in an accident before the case could go to trial. In his plea, Mr. Minucci was treated as a youthful offender.

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was briefed on yesterday's attack last night and went to the 106th Precinct in Queens, where he and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly spoke to reporters. ""The reason that we're here is that hate crimes will not be tolerated,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. Late last night, the Rev. Al Sharpton said that he had received a call from Mr. Bloomberg, assuring him that the city ""would not tolerate"" racial attacks, if this case proved to be one.

Mr. Kelly told reporters that the police were seeking Mr. Minucci's companions for questioning. He identified one of them as Anthony Ench, 24.

According to law enforcement officials, the incident began shortly after 3 a.m., when Mr. Moore and his two companions were walking under the 84th Street overpass that crosses the Belt Parkway, which separates the enclave of Lindenwood from the rest of Howard Beach. It was then, the officials said, that the three men first encountered the black Escalade.

Mr. Minucci was alone in the car at the time, and he and the three black men exchanged what Commissioner Kelly said both sides described as a ""hard stare.""

As the men walked into Howard Beach, near 157th Avenue, they saw the Escalade coming toward them, the officials said, adding that one of the black men told the others to ""post up,"" as if they were at a bus stop, and the black men stared at the Escalade, which drove on.

They had walked several blocks further when, 10 to 15 minutes later, they saw the S.U.V. again, near 159th Avenue and 79th Street, and noticed that it now carried three white men.

It stopped, and the driver, Mr. Minucci, got out, threw an aluminum baseball bat at Mr. Moore, the police said, and began running after the men. Mr. Moore and his friends, who said they heard Mr. Minucci utter a racial epithet, fled.

As his two friends, whom the police later identified as Richard Wood, 20, and Richard Pope, 25, hid in the weeds of St. Helen's, a Roman Catholic church nearby, Mr. Moore hid behind a tree, where Mr. Minucci caught sight of his red shirt and ran after him, the police said.

As he ran away, Mr. Moore tripped on the lawn of a home at 159-43 79th Street, a white two-story house.

There, Mr. Minucci came upon Mr. Moore, he told the police, and hit him in the back and in the legs with the bat. He did not admit to hitting Mr. Moore in the head with the bat, and said that Mr. Moore had injured his head on the curb. But the police said that the blow Mr. Moore suffered to his head caused a skull fracture.

While Mr. Minucci stood over Mr. Moore with the bat, the police said, another man from the Escalade pulled off Mr. Moore's Air Jordan sneakers, and stole a shopping bag containing another pair of shoes, which Mr. Moore's girlfriend, Andrea Gordon, said were a new pair of Prada dress shoes.

The white men left in the Escalade, leaving Mr. Moore on the ground, where he was quickly rejoined by his friends and taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center.

In interviews yesterday morning with detectives, Mr. Moore's companions said that they had been in the neighborhood to steal a car, a Chrysler 300, for which they had been paid $6,000 in advance, an official said. But Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman, said that at the time of the attack, the men had not committed a crime.

Yet the families of both Mr. Moore and Mr. Minucci said they were stunned and confused by the attack and charges. Mr. Moore's family said the plot to steal a car was out of character, while Mr. Minucci's relatives described him as a law-abiding young man.

Chandra Eisen, Mr. Moore's mother, said that she doubted that her son, the oldest of four children, had any plan to steal a car, as he was due to receive a settlement from a childhood car accident and is currently collecting disability benefits from the Army. She said he had gotten into scrapes with the law from time to time, but that last night he was simply walking home with friends after visiting his girlfriend and daughter.

In the short walk from the girlfriend's apartment, she said, they had wandered into the Howard Beach area. A few minutes after the first sighting of the Escalade and the stare-down, the S.U.V. circled back around, she quoted her son as saying.

Mr. Killen, a sawmill operator and preacher, sat impassively in a yellow jumpsuit, two days into his confinement at the Neshoba County jail.

""There are three lives involved in this case, and the three lives should absolutely be respected and treated equally,"" the judge said. Then he ordered Mr. Killen to serve three consecutive sentences of 20 years each.

Mr. Killen was convicted in the deaths of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, who were murdered by a group of men who prosecutors said were organized by Mr. Killen. Their disappearance, and the discovery of their bodies in an earthen dam, galvanized the civil rights movement.

Jim Hood, the state attorney general, who tried the case with Mark Duncan, the district attorney, had said Mr. Killen could receive as little as one year on each charge.

""There was a knot in my stomach until he actually gave the sentence,"" said Angela Lewis, who was 10 days old when her father, Mr. Chaney, was killed. ""The only thing I could do was sit and hope and pray it would be the maximum on all three convictions.""

Prosecutors said that a sheriff's deputy pulled over the three men on June 21, 1964, and jailed them long enough for Mr. Killen to organize a death trap. Jurors said they rejected murder charges because the evidence, much of it transcripts of testimony from a 1967 federal trial, did not prove that Mr. Killen knew that the men would be killed.

In 1967 the federal government tried 18 men for conspiring to deprive the victims of their civil rights. Seven were convicted; none served more than six years in prison. That jury deadlocked 11 to one in favor of convicting Mr. Killen; the holdout said she could not convict a preacher. The state had not brought charges in the deaths until Mr. Killen was prosecuted this year.

Mr. Hood said no other prosecutions were likely unless a new witness came forward. Mr. Duncan said that prosecutors had submitted evidence on eight living suspects to a grand jury, but that only Mr. Killen was indicted.

The prosecutors said Mr. Killen would be eligible for parole after 20 years.

Mr. Killen spent the trial in a wheelchair; he broke his legs in March while chopping wood. During the trial, he sometimes breathed through oxygen tubes, and at one point was taken to the hospital with high blood pressure.

One of Mr. Killen's lawyers, James McIntyre, said he would appeal and ask that Mr. Killen be released on bond. Mr. McIntyre said that the charge of manslaughter was introduced too late for Mr. Killen's team to prepare a defense, and that he would subpoena members of the news media whose coverage he said was biased against his client.

Mr. Killen's trial is one of several recent efforts by prosecutors to revisit notorious killings from the civil rights era. Mr. Killen is expected to join Sam Bowers, an imperial wizard in the Klan who was convicted in 1998 of the murder of the civil rights advocate Vernon Dahmer, at the state prison in Rankin County. Mr. Bowers also served time on a federal conviction in the Philadelphia case.

https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/23/opinion/23thu4.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"The name Neshoba County, Mississippi, became synonymous with publicly sanctioned murder when a sheriff's deputy conspired with the Klan to kill three young civil rights workers during the summer of 1964. The slaughter of James Earl Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner became known not just for its brutality but also for the conspiracies of silence and inaction that developed inside Mississippi itself and protected the murderers by pushing the case out of public view.

This week's conviction of Edgar Ray Killen, an 80-year-old former Klansman, brings the case to a conclusion of sorts and affords some solace to the survivors of the dead. But the lingering mystery about why the state took 40 years to bring its first charges will very likely prevent this case from achieving the definitive end that the prosecutors and citizens of Neshoba County were hoping for.

When Mississippi initially failed to act against the killers, the federal government intervened and gathered evidence enough to charge 18 people in 1967. Seven of them went to prison for brief sentences, but Mr. Killen, who was said to have recruited the mob, went free when an all-white jury deadlocked in his case.

Despite the evidence laid out in the federal case, it was not until earlier this year that Mississippi could rouse itself to indict even a single person in connection with these heinous crimes. By that time, memories of the living had faded and three crucial witnesses were dead.

Faced with a weakened case and testimony of witnesses now beyond the grave, jurors failed to convict on the primary charge of murder and settled instead on manslaughter.

The conviction of the ailing and infirm Mr. Killen is very likely the final act in one of the most notorious murder cases of the civil rights era. The underlying lesson of the case, however, is that justice delayed is quite often justice denied. Editorial",nytimes.com,True
https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/22/national/22civil.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Jurors said the evidence fell short of what they needed to convict Mr. Killen, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan, of murder.

""I should say I heard a number of very emotional statements from some of the white jurors,"" said Warren Paprocki, 54, a white juror. ""They had tears in their eyes, saying that if they could just have better evidence in the case that they would have convicted him of murder in a minute. Our consensus was the state did not produce a strong enough case.""

The defense plans to appeal. ""At least he wasn't found guilty of a willful and wanton act,"" said James McIntyre, one of Mr. Killen's lawyers. ""Manslaughter is a negligent act.""

Although the federal government tried 18 men, including Mr. Killen, on a conspiracy charge in 1967, Mr. Killen -- a preacher and sawmill operator -- was the first to be charged by the state. The 1967 jury deadlocked over Mr. Killen, and he has maintained his innocence. He faces up to 20 years in prison on each count when he is sentenced on Thursday.

As he was wheeled out of the courthouse, Mr. Killen swatted away television cameras and microphones.

With witnesses dead and memories fading, he could be the only one of the mob of Klansmen responsible for the killings to be tried. Prosecutors say that a grand jury heard all the available evidence against the eight original defendants still living but returned only one indictment, against Mr. Killen. While some in Neshoba County said it was too late and too painful to revisit the episode, others thought that in doing so, the county might find redemption.

""Finally, finally, finally,"" said Jim Prince, the editor of the local weekly newspaper, The Neshoba Democrat. ""This certainly sends a message, I think, to the criminals and to the thugs that justice reigns in Neshoba County, unlike 41 years ago.""

Ben Chaney, James Earl Chaney's younger brother, said he spoke briefly to his 82-year-old mother after the verdict. ""She's happy,"" he said. ""She finally believes that the life of her son has some value to the people in this community.""

But for some of those who had hoped to see Mr. Killen convicted of murder, the manslaughter verdict was less than a total victory. ""The fact that some members of this jury could have sat through that testimony, indeed could have lived here all these years and could not bring themselves to acknowledge that these were murders, that they were committed with malice, indicates that there are still people unfortunately among you who choose to look aside, who choose to not see the truth,"" Ms. Bender, who was married to Mr. Schwerner, said after the trial.

To Nettie Cox, the first black to run for mayor in Philadelphia, the verdict was an affront. ""Manslaughter,"" Ms. Cox said, putting her hands to her temples. ""I just can't absorb manslaughter.""

But two jurors interviewed said there was not enough evidence that Mr. Killen, who was accused of orchestrating the killings and recruiting the mob that abducted the men and beat Mr. Chaney, shooting all three, had intended for the men to die.

Both the defense and the prosecution failed to impress the jury of nine whites and three blacks. Jurors said neither presented enough witnesses and that the case relied too heavily on transcripts from the federal trial.

On Monday evening, after deliberating more than two hours, the jury reported to Judge Marcus Gordon that they were evenly divided, and he dismissed them for the night. But after deliberating for nearly three hours on Tuesday morning, they reached a unanimous verdict.

Jurors disputed an inference that manslaughter may have been a compromise verdict. One, Troy Savell, a white history teacher and coach, said he was initially in favor of acquittal, but his opinion changed as the jury deliberated. ""I think the reasonable doubt was not there that he didn't have anything to do with it,"" Mr. Savell said.

Mr. Paprocki said race did not play a role in the deliberations. One of the three blacks on the jury was vocally in favor of a murder conviction at first, Mr. Paprocki said, but he was not sure where the other two stood.

Willis Lyon, the only one of the three black jurors who could be reached by phone on Tuesday, said: ""The only thing I'll say to that regard is that we were as fair with Mr. Killen as we could have been. I think we gave him as fair a verdict on his behalf as was allowable.""

Reached by phone, Shirley Vaughan, the forewoman, said she was emotionally drained by the trial and reluctant to speak. ""With the little amount of evidence that we had, we did the very best that we could,"" she said.

Mark Duncan, the county district attorney, said he did not blame the jury for finding Mr. Killen guilty of a lesser charge than murder, pointing out that three of the four key witnesses were dead. ""I think it was asking a lot of a jury to convict a man based on testimony of people who they couldn't see. All they had were their words on paper.""

Mr. Duncan's partner in the prosecution, Attorney General Jim Hood, said two witnesses that had come forward since the case was reopened in 1999 had died, one by suicide and the other under questionable circumstances.

There were other obstacles for the prosecutors. Although seven of the original defendants, besides Mr. Killen, are still alive, they refused to testify before the grand jury in exchange for immunity, Mr. Hood said.

Confessions and other statements about the crime were not admissible if the witness was not available for cross-examination, they said.

Asked about the possible legacy of the trial, Mr. Hood said: ""I'm just a prosecutor, I don't pretend to be a sociologist. I will allow the historians to analyze what impact this trial may have on this community and the state of Mississippi and its reputation throughout the world.""

Jurors, on the other hand, said they were keenly aware of the significance and symbolism of the trial. ""I felt dispirited last night because of the six-six split,"" Mr. Paprocki said. ""I was very concerned that in the event of a hung jury that it would just reinforce the prejudicial stereotypes that have been attached to Philadelphia and Neshoba County. I was very much saddened by the fact.""

Even the judge, Marcus Gordon, and the defendant, a preacher and sawmill operator, are connected; Mr. Killen presided at the funerals for Mr. Gordon's parents.

No one has accused Judge Gordon of favoring the defense. Rather, people seem to accept such connections as inevitable in Neshoba County, with its population of only about 28,000.

Stanley Dearman, the former owner of the local weekly newspaper, The Neshoba Democrat, said that although he did not believe that behind-the-scenes relationships affected what happened in the courtroom, such links might have contributed to the 40-year delay in the state's prosecution of the case.

Mr. Dearman, who has long called for the killers to be brought to justice, is himself distantly connected to the case. Mr. Killen has said he was at a funeral home on the night of the killings. The visitation he attended was for the 4-year-old daughter of Carolyn Barrett, who is now Mr. Dearman's wife. Mrs. Dearman still has the guest book with Mr. Killen's signature in a safe-deposit box.

Mrs. Dearman's brother, Harlan Majure, who was at the funeral home that night, testified for the defense on Monday that he saw Mr. Killen at the visitation, and that he thought the Klan was a peaceful organization that ""did a lot of good.""

The intricate ties in the case extend beyond the county line. Take, for example, State Senator Gloria Williamson, who delivered one of the more dramatic moments on Sunday at a memorial service for the three victims at Mount Zion United Methodist Church. Ms. Williamson, who is white, apologized to blacks for ""all the wrong that was done"" to them. She added, ""Change had to come from outside of this little society.""

The allegiances and grievances of residents posed a particular problem when it came to selecting a jury for the Killen trial.

Throughout the trial, the defense subtly underscored the fact that many involved in the case in 1964 were not from the area.

""I was told, 'Well, they cleaned them up for the pictures,""' Ms. Posey said.

Of course, not everyone shunned the civil rights workers. Mount Zion, the black church whose burning by the Klan drew the three workers to Neshoba County, has held a memorial service for them every year since their deaths, church members say.

Jewel Rush McDonald, a member of the church, said it worried her that Judge Gordon had allowed the sequestered jury to go home for the weekend.

""This is a small town; someone is going to call them,"" Ms. McDonald said. In the 1967 federal trial, in which 7 of 18 defendants were convicted of conspiring to deprive the three victims of their civil rights, jurors reported receiving threatening phone calls telling them not to convict.

Mr. Killen, 80, is charged with murder in the 1964 deaths of three civil rights workers, James Earl Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. If convicted, he faces life in prison.

In closing arguments, defense lawyers said that prosecutors had not proved that Mr. Killen had anything to do with the crime and that they were trying the case only for publicity.

Prosecutors said Mr. Killen had planned the killings and recruited others to help. Mark Duncan, the Neshoba County district attorney, said Mr. Killen had relayed word from state Ku Klux Klan officials that Mr. Schwerner's ""elimination"" had been approved.

James McIntyre, a defense lawyer, said the case had diverted resources from fighting crime and had opened an old wound. ""This has done nothing but agitate all the citizens in the state of Mississippi,"" he said.

Tuesday, June 21, is the actual anniversary of the deaths.

On Sunday, Rita Bender, Mr. Schwerner's widow, and Barbara Dailey, the older sister of Mr. Chaney, sat in the front pew of the church, which was packed with a multiracial crowd. At the back of the low-slung sanctuary, fuzzy green chairs had been lined up to provide extra seats. A choir of teenage girls performed in white blouses, their expressions pious or painfully self-conscious.

Many of the speakers addressed the sacrifice the young men had made. One guest, Rabbi Debra L. Kassoff, director of rabbinic services at the Goldring-Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life in Jackson, said they had given their lives in tikkun, a Jewish concept meaning the repair of a broken world. ""What were they doing,"" she asked, ""if not searching for the hidden spark, the seeds of justice buried in the dust and ashes of a Mississippi summer?""

Mr. Goodman and Mr. Schwerner were Jewish.

Ms. Dailey, 63, said she had not been to one of the Mount Zion memorial services ""for years and years and years.""

""The makeup has changed,"" she said. ""There's more young people. There's more white folks.""

After her brother's death, Ms. Dailey worked at the Council of Federated Organizations in Philadelphia for two years, helping register black voters and teaching literacy classes. She said she had wanted to do civil rights work before but had refrained out of respect for her mother.

Less than a mile from the church was a second memorial event, held in a field with folding chairs, shade tents and tables laden with barbecue and homemade cakes. About 50 people gathered to hear speakers including Ben Chaney, Mr. Chaney's younger brother, and veterans of civil rights-era boycotts and sit-ins like Curtis Muhammad, who came from New Orleans, and Diane Nash of Chicago.

It was organized by what might be termed a splinter group of the committee that planned the church service. The event was on land once owned by Cornelius Steele, who was working with Mr. Schwerner to register blacks to vote. Mr. Steele is now dead; his son John helped organize the service.

John Steele said his family had decided to hold its own service because the other group was too ""soft-spoken"" about the fact that only Mr. Killen had been tried. Eight of the defendants from the 1967 case are still alive. None of those convicted in that case served more than six years.

""We're more after a full measure of justice,"" Mr. Steele said, although several members of the church planning committee have said they would also like to see others indicted.

One of the 50 or so people in attendance was David Sims, a barber who grew up next door to the Chaneys; he gave Mr. Schwerner and Mr. Goodman haircuts in Meridian on the day they left for Philadelphia and never came back.

Mr. Sims sometimes participated in their civil rights work but said he was too afraid of being beaten to submit to what they called the ""nonviolent crouch"" -- head down, hands on head -- that they were supposed to use if police officers appeared.

It was a close-up view of a time when terror was commonplace and the mere act of helping people could endanger them. The jury paid close attention, but the defendant, Edgar Ray Killen, 80, was absent from the courtroom. Mr. Killen had retreated, complaining of shortness of breath and a ""smothering sensation,"" his lawyer said, and was later taken from the Neshoba County Courthouse on a stretcher.

After a recess, the presiding circuit judge, Marcus Gordon, announced that Mr. Killen was in the hospital undergoing tests and that the trial would resume on Friday morning if doctors approved.

Mr. Killen, a sawmill operator and preacher in a wheelchair because of a tree-felling accident in January, had been in court for the first part of the morning while the judge dealt with procedural matters. But as the jury entered for the first day of testimony, his lawyer James McIntyre approached the bench and asked for permission for Mr. Killen to retire.

Because of Mr. Killen's poor health, a bed and a nurse had been provided for him in the courthouse.

With Mr. Killen's permission, the trial proceeded without him, and Ms. Bender was the first witness. The jury was not told the reason for Mr. Killen's absence because the judge did not want them to be swayed by sympathy, the judge said.

Mr. Schwerner and Mr. Chaney, who was from Meridian, built shelves to house the donated books that were not available in the public library for blacks. There was a Ping-Pong table. But the workers were also trying to help blacks register to vote, making contacts and looking for places to hold training classes. Mr. Schwerner and Mr. Chaney had visited the Mount Zion United Methodist Church, a black church in Neshoba County near Philadelphia.

In June, while they were at a training session in Ohio where they met Mr. Goodman, they learned that church leaders had been beaten by Klansmen, the church burned to the ground, Ms. Bender said.

They had been missing for two days when Ms. Schwerner learned that the station wagon had been found, burned, in the Bogue Chitto swamp in Neshoba County. By then she was at the Cincinnati airport, on her way back to Mississippi. Coincidentally a fellow civil rights proponent, Fannie Lou Hamer, was there, and the two heard the news together. Ms. Hamer, the granddaughter of slaves, drew Ms. Schwerner into her arms and the two of them cried. ""Our tears were mingling with each other,"" Ms. Bender said.

Seven were convicted, but the jury deadlocked on Mr. Killen because of one holdout juror.

Investigators verified the transcript's authenticity, Mr. Garrity said, by comparing it with what people who had seen the trial remembered, and with a book written by Steve Whitaker, a scholar who had a copy until his basement flooded in the 1980's.

The newfound copy was first reported yesterday by The Clarion-Ledger, the Jackson daily. Mr. Garrity described it as a ""copy of a copy of a copy.""

""It was in pretty poor shape,"" he said, ""so we had to go through it line by line, word by word, and retype it"" before it was given to the local prosecutor pursuing the case.

The transcript presumably records the defense argument that prosecutors had not proved that the body was Emmett's, and that there was therefore no proof of his murder. Jurors cited that argument as the primary reason for their acquittal of the two defendants, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam.

As part of its inquiry, which was prompted by two documentaries suggesting that other people had been involved, the F.B.I. plans to exhume Emmett's body, buried near Chicago. No autopsy was ever performed, and investigators want an official determination of the cause of death, as well as DNA testing to confirm the victim's identity.

Scholars and filmmakers have long sought a copy of the transcript. But other important pieces of evidence have long been lost as well. For instance, the cotton gin fan that was attached to Emmett's neck with barbed wire to weigh down his body in the river disappeared when the county courthouse was remodeled.

Leesha Faulkner, a reporter who covers courts and government for The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, said old documents were often hard to find in Mississippi.

""If something didn't suit somebody, they took it home and put it in their attic and never said anything about it,"" Ms. Faulkner said. In the 1980's, she said, she was at an auction in Greenwich Village when she found government photos, and a state official's detailed account, of the 1962 rioting by whites in response to the earliest desegregation at the University of Mississippi.

Until yesterday, the last person known to have had a trial transcript in the Till case was Mr. Whitaker, now a researcher for the Florida Department of Health. As a graduate student in 1962, he was assigned to revisit the trial for his master's thesis in political science. He says the jurors, who received him openly because he had grown up in the county, told him they did not doubt that Mr. Bryant and Mr. Milam had been responsible for the killing.

Mr. Whitaker says he obtained his copy of the transcript, a thick sheaf of onionskin with a binder clip, from the lead defense lawyer, J.J. Breland, after interviewing him for hours over a fifth of Jack Daniel's.

""He just gave it to me,"" Mr. Whitaker said in an interview yesterday. ""They looked on it as assisting me with my research. They never asked for it back.""

Mr. Whitaker said he believed that the transcript had been ordered by the defense team and had never been an official court document.

According to Mr. Whitaker's master's thesis, his copy did not include the lawyers' closing arguments, in which the defense told the jurors that even in the face of national press coverage, ""every last Anglo-Saxon one of you has the courage to free these men,"" and warning that the jurors' ""forefathers would turn over in their graves if these boys were convicted on such evidence as this.""

But the transcript now in the possession of the F.B.I. does presumably capture one of the trial's most electrifying moments: Moses Wright, Emmett's great-uncle, when asked to identify the men who had taken the boy from Mr. Wright's home, pointed to one defendant and said, ""There he is; that's the man,"" and then immediately identified the other.

Police also charged two Staten Island men with hate crimes after they burst into the dormitory room of a Muslim student at Stony Brook University on Long Island on Oct. 29, hitting him and overturning his furniture while shouting anti-Muslim slurs.

On Staten Island, a 12-year-old Muslim boy was beaten last June by another student who shouted anti-Muslim language at him.

But the number of complaints involving governmental agencies and workplace discrimination dropped from 2003.

The police said the student, Alicia A. Hardin, admitted Monday to sending the letters. Ms. Hardin, of Chicago, said she was unhappy at Trinity International, an evangelical Christian college in Chicago's northern suburbs, and wanted her parents to think the campus was unsafe so she could transfer, the police said.

For those connected to the university, where some minority students left campus last week in response to what had been taken to be serious threats of violence, the turn of events was cause not only for relief but also for confusion and concern about Ms. Hardin's well-being.

What began as a gunpoint holdup, with the man from upstairs concealing his face with a ski mask, ended tragically when one of the victims, an 8-year-old girl, slipped her bonds and recognized the gunman as her neighbor, officials said. They said the family was wiped out to eliminate witnesses in a crime that netted about $3,000 from A.T.M.'s, where surveillance cameras provided crucial evidence.

While the brutal killings appeared to have the characteristics of a hate crime and exposed deep fissures between Jersey City's Egyptian Muslim and Coptic Orthodox communities, officials stressed yesterday that it was a bungled robbery, not religious enmities, that had led to the murders of Hossam Armanious, 47, his wife, Amal Garas, 37, and their two children, Sylvia, 15, and Monica, 8.

''I'd like to make one thing perfectly clear,'' Edward J. De Fazio, the Hudson County prosecutor, said at a news conference. ''The motive for these murders was robbery. This is a crime based on greed, desperate need of money by the two men charged with these murders.''

For many Jersey City Muslims and Copts who had lived in peace for years but who feared that the case might lead to the kind of sectarian strife that has plagued their communities in Egypt for centuries, there were expressions of relief that two men -- neither Egyptian nor Muslim -- had been charged in a murderous robbery.

But for others, seven weeks of raw nerves, insults and mounting tensions were not dispelled. Some Christians refused to believe the official version of what happened, and some Muslims demanded an apology for what they called unjustified suspicions and verbal abuse by the Coptic community. For such antagonists, little had changed, and it was unclear what it would take, or how long, to heal the wounds.

In the afternoon yesterday, as softly weeping relatives and friends of the victims glared at them in the background, the suspects, Edward McDonald, 25, who had rented an upstairs apartment from the family two months before the murders, and Hamilton Sanchez, 30, of Newark, were arraigned before Judge Kevin G. Callahan in Hudson County Superior Court on four counts of felony murder.

Both men had their hands cuffed behind them. During a reading of the charges, Mr. McDonald, clad in black pants and a dirty white shirt, appeared calm and answered questions in a steady voice. But Mr. Sanchez, in dark jeans and a gray pullover, sobbed uncontrollably as the names of the victims were read aloud. Both defendants pleaded not guilty and were ordered held in $10 million bail.

Nearly 100 spectators -- many of them friends, relatives and members of the Coptic church to which the victims belonged -- filled the high-ceilinged, wood-paneled courtroom for the proceedings, many of them murmuring and glaring at the defendants. Led away by court officers down a gantlet-like aisle between the spectators, Mr. Sanchez, still sobbing, blurted out: ''I didn't kill nobody. I didn't kill nobody, man. I didn't. I didn't kill nobody, people.''

Briefing reporters, Mr. De Fazio provided an account of the crime that was so detailed it appeared to be drawn, at least in part, from statements made by one or both defendants, although the prosecutor declined to say if any statements had been made. He said that Mr. McDonald and Mr. Sanchez had met by prearrangement in the vestibule of the family's home at 85 Oakland Avenue at 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 11.

Mr. McDonald, he said, put on a ski mask to hide his identity and drew a semi-automatic handgun. Mr. Sanchez wore no mask, the prosecutor said. The men then knocked on the family's first-floor door. Ms. Garas -- home alone with her two daughters -- opened it, and the men burst in. They bound the mother and daughters with rope, gagged them and placed them in separate rooms, the prosecutor said.

The assailants then ransacked the house for money and waited two hours for Mr. Armanious to come home, the prosecutor said, and then bound and gagged him at gunpoint too. The men took money and an A.T.M. card from Mr. Armanious's wallet and were searching for more cash when Monica, who had slipped her ropes and was trying to sneak out, recognized Mr. McDonald as the tenant upstairs.

Mr. McDonald took her into a bathroom and, with a knife from the kitchen, cut her throat, Mr. De Fazio said. He said Mr. Sanchez then cut the throats of Mr. Armanious in a bedroom, Ms. Garas in an adjoining room and Sylvia in the children's bedroom, to eliminate all the witnesses.

Over the next two days, the victims were missed at their jobs and schools -- Mr. Armanious at the banquet room of the Westin Princeton hotel, Ms. Garas at the United States Postal Service in Kearney, Sylvia in her 10th-grade classes at Dickinson High School and Monica at J.W. Wakeman School No. 6, where she was a third grader.

Ms. Garas's brother, Ayman Garas, who tried unsuccessfully to contact the family, called the Jersey City police on Jan. 14 after going to their home around midnight. No one responded, and the police broke in at 4 a.m. and found the bodies.

In the meantime, the prosecutor said, the robbers had used Mr. Armanious's A.T.M. card five or six times to withdraw a total of about $3,000 at cash outlets in Jersey City and Manhattan. Surveillance cameras caught one or both suspects, investigators said. They were seized on Thursday. Officials said that both suspects had federal criminal records. Mr. Sanchez, they said, was convicted in 1995 of possessing weapons and distributing heroin and sentenced to 10 years in prison. It was unclear when he was released, but he had been working in a barbershop for four months.

Mr. McDonald was convicted of distributing drugs on school grounds and bail jumping in Hudson County in 2002, and served 18 months. He was released last September. His last job was painting lines on a parking lot, officials said.

Mr. De Fazio said he had not decided whether to seek the death penalty, but said: ''This was a brutal attack, a vicious attack, on this family. They were desperate for money and greed was the cause of these murders.''

For Egyptian-Americans in New Jersey, the nightmare seemed to come true in January. A Christian family of four was found slaughtered in their Jersey City home. It was rumored that the father had exchanged angry words with a Muslim on the Internet.

Egyptian Muslims and Egyptian Coptic Christians are at brutal odds with each other in their homeland, but those who had immigrated to the United States had nonetheless managed to live peacefully.

Now they seemed as if they could be headed toward a Muslim-Christian face-off..

Yesterday, two suspects, both of them non-Egyptian and non-Muslim, were charged with murder: an upstairs neighbor, Edward McDonald, and his friend, Hamilton Sanchez. The two men pleaded not guilty in the deaths of Hossam Armanious, his wife and their two school-age children.

Coptic Christians and Muslims alike expressed relief yesterday, but suspicions linger. Fred Ayad, 69, a former deputy mayor of Jersey City, expressed a sense of relief that many Copts were feeling.

''Thank God, it's not a religious matter,'' he said, biting his words. ''If they had been Egyptian or Muslim, we would have had ---- ''

He searched for a word, adding, ''We would have had problems.''

Muslims shared the relief. Ahmed Moustafa, 64, when told by an Arabic-speaking reporter about the arrests, shouted in Arabic to other Muslims in his office: ''He's American! He's not a Muslim!''

But asked if this development would improve relations between Copts and Muslims, Mr. Moustafa, a notary public, turned derisive, asking, ''Do you think this will clean our image with them and other Americans?''

The Armanious family belonged to the Coptic Orthodox Church, the principal Christian church in Egypt. The Copts date their feud with the Muslims back to the seventh century and the rise of Islam.

Mr. Ayad, the former deputy mayor, estimated that fewer than 2,000 Coptic Christians lived in Jersey City when he arrived there 34 years ago. Now there are 17,000, with 60,000 statewide, he said.

While Coptic Christians probably outnumber Egyptian Muslims in the state, they retain resentments from their homeland, according to Dr. Monir Dawoud, 65, a surgeon and the acting president of the American Coptic Association. ''We came with an inferiority complex from Egypt, where we were treated as second-class citizens,'' he said. After the murder of the Armanious family, he said, ''people were really emotionally very hot.''

Mr. Armanious, whose chat room name was I Love Jesus, was said to have been threatened with death by someone in an Internet chat room during an argument about Christianity and Islam.

Despite the arrests, some Coptic Christians in Jersey City remained unwilling to let go of their suspicions that a Muslim was involved in the killings. Marcos Nashaat, 50, a bodega owner, said ''it doesn't make sense'' for a Christian to be the killer. ''Why would he kill them when he can make a robbery of any store without killing?''

Such sentiments trouble Sheik Tarek Youssof Saleh, 42, a Muslim cleric who was vilified when he offered condolences at the funeral of the Armanious family. ''I tried to go to the funeral to show support, and they called me killer and animal and terrorist,'' he said, referring to Copts in the crowd.

But he added, ''Most Christians, they are good.''

Still, Sheik Saleh, imam of the Oulel Albab Mosque in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, singled out the American Coptic Association for criticism, saying the group should apologize for berating Muslims.

Dr. Dawoud of the Coptic organization bridled at that suggestion.

''No!'' he said. ''You don't apologize to terrorists. Muslims should not feel this way. Why should they want an apology? The majority of Muslims are not terrorists and should not feel insulted.''

Bishop David, 37, leader of the Coptic churches of the Northeast, speaks carefully when describing his reaction to the arrest of the suspects and the heated exchanges between Copts and Muslims.

''There's been a little bit of history between our two groups,'' he said.

''People were under a lot of confusion, and when a person is under that confusion they sometimes say things ----'' Bishop David did not finish his sentence.

''But our religion teaches us to love our ----''

Again he did not finish the sentence.

There is more than the concern about the rising complications of absorbing newcomers, now one-tenth of the population, many of them from largely Muslim countries. Many Dutch also seem bewildered that their country, run for decades on a cozy, political consensus, now seems so tense and prickly and bent on confrontation. Those leaving have been mostly lured by large English-speaking nations like Australia, New Zealand and Canada, where they say they hope to feel less constricted.

In interviews, emigrants rarely cited a fear of militant Islam as their main reason for packing their bags. But the killing of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh, a fierce critic of fundamentalist Muslims, seems to have been a catalyst.

""Our Web site got 13,000 hits in the weeks after the van Gogh killing,"" said Frans Buysse, who runs an agency that handles paperwork for departing Dutch. ""That's four times the normal rate.""

Mr. van Gogh's killing is the only one the police have attributed to an Islamic militant, but since then they have reported finding death lists by local Islamic militants with the names of six prominent politicians. The effects still reverberate. In a recent opinion poll, 35 percent of the native Dutch questioned had negative views about Islam.

Many who settle abroad may not appear in migration statistics, like the growing contingent of retirees who flock to warmer places. But official statistics show a trend. In 1999, nearly 30,000 native Dutch moved elsewhere, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics. For 2004, the provisional figure is close to 40,000. ""It's definitely been picking up in the past five years,"" said Cor Kooijmans, a demographer at the bureau.

Ruud Konings, an accountant, has just sold his comfortable home in the small town of Hilvarenbeek. In March, after a year's worth of paperwork, the family will leave for Australia. The couple said the main reason was their fear for the welfare and security of their two teenage children.

Until the killing of Pim Fortuyn, a populist anti-immigration politician, in 2002 and the more recent slaying of a teacher by a student, this generation of Dutch people could not conceive of such violence in their peaceful country.

Blaming immigrants for many ills has become commonplace. Conservative Moroccans and Turks from rural areas are accused of disdaining the liberal Dutch ways and of making little effort to adapt. Immigrant youths now make up half the prison population. More than 40 percent of immigrants receive some form of government assistance, a source of resentment among native Dutch. Immigrants say, though, that they are widely discriminated against.

Ms. Konings said the Dutch themselves brought on some of the social frictions. The Dutch ""thought that we had to adapt to the immigrants and that we had to give them handouts,"" she said. ""We've been too lenient; now it's difficult to turn the tide.""

""We don't want them in the church!""

In a telephone interview yesterday afternoon, Sheik Saleh said he never intended to cause trouble and regretted attending the funeral. ""I didn't come to hurt anyone, I came to support them,"" said Sheikh Saleh, 42, the imam of the Oulel Albab Mosque on Bay Ridge Avenue, sounding shaken. ""I am sorry.""

The uproar outside the community center of St. George and St. Shenouda Coptic Orthodox Church, on Bergen Avenue, began when some of the hundreds of mourners present saw a Coptic bishop hug the sheik before the sheik left in a police car, several members of the church said. According to the Rev. Antonious Tanious and several other Coptic Christians, two men began screaming at Bishop David, who presides over the Coptic churches in the Northeast, asking him how he could let a Muslim attend the service.

Panicked police officers whisked the two men and some others into a nearby garage and closed the metal door just as a swell of people, some screaming and waving wooden crosses, pressed up against the door.

""A metal gate on the garage was pulled down to prevent the groups from attacking each other,"" said Capt. John Tooke of the Jersey City Police Department. ""It was a very chaotic and emotional scene. We had people that were rowdy, disruptive and really out of control.""

After 15 minutes, most of the group in the garage was allowed to leave. The two men were detained but not charged, Captain Tooke said. Another man walked around dazed afterward, his hand bleeding. ""We tell the Muslim people, 'Don't come here.' We don't like them and they come,"" said Nadia Sourrial, a church member, echoing a sentiment expressed by numerous other people who were interviewed. ""They like to show us we're dead.""

In the interview yesterday, Sheik Saleh said two editors of local Arabic-language newspapers called him on Sunday evening and advised him to go to the funeral in a show of solidarity between Muslims and Christians, he said.

Sheik Saleh, who is Egyptian, went with one of the editors, Ahmed Saleh Maharem, who is also a columnist. Mr. Maharem said at least 10 other Muslims were present, and some were welcomed. But the Sheik, who wore a white abayya, or head covering, was most noticeably Muslim.

Dozens of other Muslims, many of them community leaders, canceled plans to attend the funeral after seeing television reports about the mounting friction, said Debbie Almontaser, a Muslim community activist in Brooklyn. The New Jersey office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations released a statement Monday saying that the organization had called on law enforcement authorities to do everything in their power to apprehend those responsible for the murders.

Investigators, who are working with the F.B.I., continued to comb the family's house on Oakland Avenue over the weekend in search of clues. Theft appeared to be at least part of the motive: investigators said that only a penny remained in the house after the slayings and that Mr. Armanious's pockets and wallet had been emptied.

The police would not confirm reports by Coptic Christians that Mr. Armanious had engaged in fiery debates about Christianity and Islam in an Internet chat room, which fueled rumors that the murders were a hate crime.

A Justice Department official did confirm a report, on WABC-TV, that a relative of the slain family was a translator for the government in the case of Lynne F. Stewart, the lawyer accused of aiding terrorists. The official said the translator was a distant relative who had not seen the family in several years, adding, ""We believe there is no connection between this person and the slaying.""

The friction started before the funeral yesterday morning as hundreds of people gathered for a procession in Journal Square in downtown Jersey City. One man yelled, ""Who is going to be next?"" as pallbearers lifted the four bronze coffins out of the hearses.

Several women began wailing and crying, beating their fists on the coffins and slapping their own faces as the procession slowly began to move along Bergen Avenue. About 20 clergymen in white robes crashed cymbals and led the group, with Bishop David, in a melodious and haunting Coptic song, asking God for mercy.

Shopkeepers, pedestrians and other passers-by stood stunned at the edge of the six-lane avenue, watching intently as the four coffins moved past, each one marked by a photograph of the victim inside. Even the pallbearers wept.

The procession ended after four blocks, as hundreds of people crowded into the church's community center. The coffins were placed in a row at the front, covered by floral wreaths. Relatives of the family rocked back and forth in grief as the service began, with clergy members reading from the Bible and friends remembering the slain family.

A Sunday school teacher read from several essays Sylvia had written, including: ""The only good thing I absolutely adore about Jersey is that my church is in it. I love my church to death.""

As the service progressed, Sheik Saleh was standing on the sidewalk outside when a police officer invited him in, he said, followed by a church member who led him to the front, where the mayor of Jersey City, Jerramiah T. Healy, was ending a speech.

Suddenly, several people cried, ""Out! Out!"" and the room erupted in loud shouts. Ayman Garas, the brother of one of the victims, Amal Garas, yelled in Arabic for everyone to stop, and Bishop David invited the sheik to sit with several Coptic clergymen.

The crowd continued to yell until Bishop David called out: ""Everyone has to show the teachings of Christ, the love. I would like everyone to sit down and be in peace.""

After the bodies were entombed in crypts at Rosedale Cemetery and Crematory in Linden, the funeral party returned to Bergen Avenue to share a meal of chicken and mashed potatoes. Bishop David, when asked what he thought of one of the men who yelled at him after the funeral, said, ""People are angry. He's still our child.""

In a new development, law enforcement officials said yesterday that money had been stolen from the house: Mr. Armanious' pockets had been turned out and his wallet was empty. ""There was no cash in the house,"" Mr. Gregory said. ""All that was left was a penny.""

The Coptic Church is the principal Christian church in Egypt. Ten percent to 15 percent of Egyptians are members of the church, which has had a fraught history with the country's Muslim majority. The church's local leaders say the number of Coptic Christians in the United States exceeds 500,000.

The Armanious murders have made global news, eliciting condolences from around the Middle East. The leader of Coptic Christians, Pope Shenouda III, called from Egypt when he heard about the case, said Bishop David, who presides over the Coptic churches of the Northeast. Bishop David, who in keeping with religious tradition does not use a second name, visited the Bergen Avenue church yesterday and told congregants not to jump to conclusions about the slayings. He said several Muslim leaders had called him with condolences.

""Everything we can do to make peace we will do,"" Bishop David said after the memorial service, flanked by reporters and church members as he stood on the sidewalk. ""I cannot make speculations. This is the job of the police.""

But the state never brought murder charges in the case, and it was not until 1999 that the state's attorney general reopened the matter, after The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Miss., published exposés, including excerpts from a secret interview given to a state archivist by Sam Bowers, the onetime imperial wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, America's most violent white supremacist group in the 1960's.

The victims were working with the Congress of Racial Equality at a community center in Meridian. Mr. Chaney had been a volunteer there for months. Mr. Schwerner had gone to Mississippi with his wife, Rita, in January 1964, having been hired as a CORE field worker. Mr. Goodman, a graduate of the Walden School on Manhattan's Upper West Side, arrived in Mississippi only a day before he was killed.

On June 21, 1964, the three men set out together in a Ford station wagon to inspect the ruins of a black church near Philadelphia, Miss., that had been firebombed by the Klan. Mr. Chaney was driving. In the afternoon, they were arrested for ""speeding"" by a Neshoba County deputy sheriff, Cecil Price. They were held at the sheriff's office in Philadelphia for several hours.

During those hours, according to testimony at the federal trial, Deputy Price sent out word that the three in custody included a man who had been designated Goatee -- the Klan's code for Mr. Schwerner, who had a goatee and had been marked for death by Mr. Bowers. Mr. Schwerner had infuriated the Klan by organizing a boycott of a white-owned variety store until it hired a black, and by his intensive work to register black voters.

According to testimony in the federal trial, Deputy Price held the men long enough for Mr. Killen to round up a group of Klansmen. The civil rights workers were released from jail and were never seen again, although their subsequent movements were later established.

Leaving the jail that night, they drove down Route 19, tailed by Deputy Price and two carloads of Klansmen. After a frantic chase, they were caught and taken to an isolated spot on Rock Cut Road, where they were killed: Mr. Schwerner on Mr. Bowers's orders, and Mr. Chaney and Mr. Goodman because they were witnesses.

Six weeks later, after one of the largest searches ever undertaken by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, helped by 200 American sailors, the bodies were discovered. In the ensuing federal investigation, 19 men were arrested on charges of violating the victims' civil rights, and 18 were eventually brought to trial three years after the killings. Mr. Bowers, Mr. Price and five others were convicted; three others were released because the jury found itself deadlocked. The rest were acquitted.

Mr. Killen, the man charged last night, is one of eight suspects still alive. He was identified during the 1967 trial as the Klan leader who had received the orders from Mr. Bowers to kill Mr. Schwerner, and as the man who had coordinated the Klansmen's activities on the night of the killings. But he was released with the jury deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of conviction. The lone holdout insisted she could never convict a preacher.

Mississippi has reopened some old civil rights murder cases. In 1994, Byron de la Beckwith was convicted of the 1963 assassination of Medgar Evers, a field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

A critical piece of evidence in the murder of the civil rights workers has been the 3,000-page transcript of the 1967 federal trial. Under the court rules in Mississippi, even the testimony of witnesses who have died or are unavailable can be put before a grand jury. Indeed, such testimony was used to convict Mr. de la Beckwith, who died in prison in 2001.

While the killings of the civil rights workers have remained in the public eye over the years, there was little progress in the case until it was reopened by Attorney General Jim Hood. Last month, an anonymous donor posted a $100,000 reward for information leading to murder charges.

""After 40 years to come back and do something like this is ridiculous, like a nightmare,"" Mr. Posey said. He refused to talk about what he expected to be asked by the grand jury.

Efforts to bring about a trial for the murder of civil rights workers in Mississippi have been enhanced in recent years by the opening of the long-secret files of the State Sovereignty Commission, which was founded in 1956 to defend the state from ""encroachment"" by federal authorities. Before it was abolished in 1977, the commission monitored anyone suspected of promoting racial integration. Containing 87,000 names, the files detail a series of Klan killings in the 1960's, including those of Mr. Evers and Mr. Dahmer, as well as those of Mr. Schwerner, Mr. Chaney and Mr. Goodman.

They also detail the profound hatred that many white Mississippians held for civil rights workers. In 1964, a wave of thousands of civil rights activists, many of them white college students from the North, went to Mississippi and other states in the South as part of a broad coalition to end the political disenfranchisement of black people.

""All aspects of the fire, including whether other individuals or other crimes were involved, are still under investigation,"" said Allen F. Loucks, who began on Monday as the interim United States attorney for Maryland.

Investigators have suggested revenge as a possible motive for the fires, which Donna Sanger, an assistant United States attorney who is prosecuting the case, said suspects had called Operation Payback.

One defendant, Aaron L. Speed, 21, of Waldorf, a guard for the development, had been upset that his employer showed indifference after his infant son died in the spring, investigators said. Another defendant, Jeremy D. Parady, 20, of Accokeek, may have been angry, officials said, because the builder rejected his employment application.

Al Manar, a popular Arabic channel run by the Hezbollah militia out of Lebanon, beams its anti-American, anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic messages by satellite into thousands of homes, cafes, restaurants and shops throughout France every day.

But a yearlong campaign by the French government to shut down Al Manar has been thwarted by the law.

Last month, France's public broadcasting regulator, the Audio-Visual Higher Council, similar to the Federal Communications Commission, granted Al Manar a license to operate in France as long as it abides by French law. Al Manar had to agree ''not to incite hate, violence or discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion or nationality.''

Four days later, however, the channel broadcast one report claiming that for years Israel had spread the AIDS virus and other diseases throughout the Arab world, and a second calling for war against Jews and the destruction of Israel. The broadcasts set off new demands by French officials, members of Parliament, academics and commentators to shut down the channel.

''This affects the security of our fragile suburbs, the interest of France, the respect for human rights, even the honor of our country,'' Ladislas Poniatowski, a senator from Normandy, told a public senate session last week with Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin. ''We must stop the broadcasts of Al Manar without delay. I'm demanding it.''

Mr. Poniatowski was loudly applauded. Mr. Raffarin agreed, saying, ''These programs are incompatible with our values.''

The Council of State, France's highest judicial administrative authority, will rule Saturday whether the channel can be banned under French law. But Mr. Raffarin confessed, ''We don't have the judicial means to intervene immediately.''

Al Manar estimates that it reaches 10 million viewers in dozens of countries. The channel is transmitted through international satellite providers in a package with other Arabic channels, often free. It is available in the United States through Intelsat, despite the fact that Hezbollah was listed by the State Department as a terrorist organization in 1997.

But it is in France that the battle lines have been drawn, because of its five million to six million Muslims and 600,000 Jews, the largest Jewish population in Europe. The status of Al Manar here has become a test of whether any government can legally or technically impose limits on satellite television broadcasts on its soil.

Al Manar beamed its first signal from its headquarters in a Beirut suburb in 1991, but its global reach was felt only nine years later when it began to broadcast via satellite.

The French government largely ignored the channel until it broadcast a virulently anti-Semitic Syrian-made series during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan in October 2003. The series had scenes depicting Jews as plotting to take over the world and the murder of a Christian child on a rabbi's orders so the blood could be used to bake matzos for Passover.

''It was more than disgusting,'' said one senior French official who saw it. ''It was impossible to look at. When Raffarin saw it he immediately said, 'We have to shut it down.'''

But when the French government asked Eutelsat, the French satellite company offering the channel, to ban it, there was no legal way to do so. So in July France modified a law to make it easier to ban unlicensed television channels like Al Manar.

The Council of State refused. It ruled that Al Manar should be allowed to broadcast as long as it adhered to regulations. After the channel signed the agreement with the commission pledging to do so, the commission gave it a license.

''That decision officially authorized anti-Semitic propaganda,'' said Roger Cukierman, chairman of France's main Jewish organization, the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions. Banning the channel is possible, he added, ''because France is a country where things are regulated -- we don't have the First Amendment here.''

But Dominique Baudis, president of the audio-visual commission, defended the decision to license Al Manar, arguing that his panel lacked the legal tools to block it.

''What to do when images 'fall from the sky'?'' he asked in an opinion article in Le Monde last week. ''In no other country where these programs are broadcast, in Europe or the United States, have public authorities intervened. We are alone in attempting something without truly having effective legal means.''

American Jewish groups, including the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, have joined in criticizing the decision to allow the broadcasts in France. But they also acknowledge that little has been done to prevent Al Manar from broadcasting in the United States, in part because the laws prosecuting racist and hate crimes are much weaker in the United States than in France.

''We don't have the same laws in the United States,'' Abraham Foxman, president of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a telephone interview. ''If France takes this new approach, hopefully we can learn from it.''

On Wednesday, the American Jewish Committee sent a letter to Treasury Secretary John W. Snow asking that Al Manar be shut down in the United States under existing counterterrorism laws and executive orders. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, David A. Harris, the executive director, acknowledged, ''Frankly, this was not on the radar screen until it emerged as an issue in France.''

So far, the Bush administration has not taken a position on whether it can shut down the channel in the United States. Asked at a briefing in October whether the United States could stop the broadcasts, Adam Ereli, a State Department spokesman, said, ''At this point, I'm not in a position to speculate about what steps may or may not be taken.''

As for Al Manar itself, Mohammed Haidar, its president, admits mistakes have been made and has pledged to do better to comply with the agreement reached with the audio-visual commission.

''It is important for us to be seen, not only in France, but in Europe and the rest of the world,'' Mr. Haidar said in a telephone interview in Arabic from Beirut. ''We would be disappointed if we were barred from being transmitted in France. This would be unjust and unfair.''

The hourlong report on ''20/20'' re-examines the murder of Mr. Shepard, 21, a college student who was tied to a fence, beaten and left to die by two men outside Laramie, Wyo.

The program includes prison interviews with the confessed killers, Aaron J. McKinney and Russell A. Henderson, who are serving life sentences. Mr. McKinney tells the ABC News correspondent Elizabeth Vargas that he was high on methamphetamine when he killed Mr. Shepard in a rage, explaining that his intent was to beat up and rob him.

''Did you kill Matthew Shepard because he was gay?'' Ms. Vargas asks. ''No, I did not,'' Mr. McKinney replies.

Mr. Henderson, who is appealing his sentence, also says on camera that the killing was simply a robbery gone bad. ''It was not because me and Aaron had anything against gays,'' he says.

Those leading the charge against the heavily promoted ABC report -- including Joan Garry, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation -- said the program relied on speculation, two convicted killers and other witnesses lacking credibility who are now changing their stories or making accusations that cannot be proved.

Ms. Garry and others also noted that the contentions that robbery and drugs figured into the killing are old news, as is the assertion of the Albany County prosecutor, Cal Rerucha, that Mr. Shepard's sexual orientation played no role in the killing, as he re-states in the ''20/20'' interview.

''I would be prepared to hear a sound argument that something else was at play; this was not a sound argument,'' Ms. Garry said in an interview.

Jeffrey W. Schneider, an ABC News vice president, said he understood the concerns, which he said had been expressed in calls to the network. But he called the report ''both fair and accurate'' and said it was a result of a six-month investigation.

''I don't think our piece in any way diminishes a vitally important national conversation about hate,'' he said.

Sean Maloney, the lawyer for Judy Shepard, Mr. Shepard's mother, called the program ''just bad journalism,'' a simplification of a complex case. He appears in the report with Ms. Shepard.

''No one has maintained that this was only a hate crime,'' Mr. Maloney, a lawyer at Willie Farr & Gallagher in New York City, said in an interview. But ''there is a mountain of evidence that anti-gay bias was a trigger for the beating that left Matthew dead after they robbed him.''

Others said they welcomed a fresh look at the case. ''Whether this killing constitutes a hate crime or drug-fueled rage, robbery, some combination or whatever, we must not lose sight of justice,'' said Bill Dobbs, a lawyer and advocate for gay rights in Manhattan who opposed the death penalty in the case. Mr. Dobbs said he did not agree with every aspect of the ''20/20'' program but applauded ABC for producing it.

There has never been a unanimity of opinion about what role homophobia played in the case.

The law's advocates had tried to pass a more specific bill, identifying race, religion, gender, national origin or sexual orientation as the motivation for the crime, but were stymied in the House over the inclusion of sexual orientation. The bill passed when lawmakers removed all protected categories.

""It was the best that could be accomplished at the time,"" said Harry Knox, formerly executive director of Georgia Equality, a gay rights group. ""We tried to get more from the Legislature but couldn't.""

It also said the law put decisions like who should be protected into the hands of police officers, judges and juries, leaving it open to arbitrary interpretations.

The state had argued that the law did not need to be so specific because it was only a sentencing statute, and the aggravated assault law laid out the unlawful conduct. But the court said the hate-crimes law established a sentence for additional conduct, selecting the victim.

In local bars where Hispanic immigrants gather, they complain that blacks are jealous of their economic success and are out to get them. In the African-American community, there is grumbling that Hispanics are ""taking over"" -- that they speak only Spanish and that Hispanic businesses rarely hire blacks.

""The attacks showed the separation between the two communities,"" said Ray Blanco, a Cuban immigrant who arrived 26 years ago and is expected to be elected as Plainfield's first Hispanic councilman in November. ""Hispanics were in one corner and the rest were in another.""

Plainfield, a city of about 50,000 people at the western edge of Union County, has faced racial problems before. The city's grand mansions were split into apartments during World War II to house local factory workers, and Southern blacks poured into Plainfield soon after that, competing with whites for housing and jobs. In 1967, several days of race riots broke out after a white police officer refused to intervene in an assault among black youths. White residents began moving out, and before long, Plainfield was an African-American enclave with a downtown of mostly empty storefronts.

Hispanics started trickling in during the 1960's, when a handful of Cuban immigrants arrived. The flow was small but steady until about 10 years ago, when a wave of immigrants, mostly from Colombia and Central America, began to arrive to work in factories like the one operated by Berkeley Contract Packaging, which boxes cosmetics and pharmaceuticals at a plant in nearby Kenilworth.

Between 1990 and 2000, the Hispanic population rose by 72 percent to about 12,000, according to the United States Census. By 2000, blacks numbered about 29,500; whites, about 10,000. And that count probably understates the actual growth in the Hispanic population because illegal immigrants are often undercounted, and the immigration seems to have continued.

""It's really been in the last five years that we've seen this 400 percent explosion in Plainfield,"" said Dr. Gerald Lamont Thomas, pastor of Shiloh Baptist, a local black church, of what he sees as the growth in the Hispanic population.

Most of the time everyone gets along, he said. But when local Hispanics began opening businesses selling phone cards, ethnic food or other items that seemed to cater only to Latinos, the city's African-Americans took notice. Malcolm Dunn, a black member of the City Council, raised the point at a 1998 Council meeting, and again in 2002. ""I endured all-white stores,"" he said at the 2002 meeting. ""Now I'm dealing with all-Hispanic stores.""

In an interview this week, Mr. Dunn said his comments were meant to inspire black entrepreneurship, not to denigrate Hispanics.

Others in the black community have voiced similar sentiments about the burgeoning Hispanic presence.

""A lot of these young guys say that the Hispanics are taking over,"" said Colleen Fields, 50, a black activist who works closely with the homeless community.

As a result, he said, many blacks feel slighted. ""We see them and we don't know much about them,"" he said. ""There's a sense of being threatened by their presence. And any time there's the sense of a threat, bad things happen.""

Dr. Thomas and other prominent black leaders say the attacks were not an outgrowth of that tension. ""The people who did the attacks were psychos,"" said Plainfield's mayor, Albert T. McWilliams, who is black. ""They were not representative.""

The police chief of Plainfield, Edward Santiago, said that he thought the attacks were caused by greed, not racial hatred. ""If these immigrants walking the street were destitute without money, they would not have been assaulted,"" he said. ""I don't think the primary factor was, 'I hate Spanish people.""'

But Michael Parenti, the chief of the North Plainfield Police Department in neighboring Somerset County, said that the violence immediately struck him as too extreme for a mugging. ""To hit someone with a baseball bat, you have to hate someone,"" Chief Parenti said. ""To beat a guy for a few dollars never made a lot of sense to me. It looked to me like a bias incident.""

According to documents filed in the case, race played a significant role. Witnesses linked Mr. Perreira to the ""Bajan Bad Boys,"" a group of young black men who often bragged about attacking ""Ricans.""

""It was racism,"" Mr. Romero-Figueroa said of the attack, which has left him able to speak out of only the left side of his mouth.

""They beat me and left me to die.""

It was the June 10 beating of Mr. Romero-Figueroa that led Carmen Salavarrieta, a local Hispanic advocate, to call the Spanish-language and local news media. She said she had already heard of several attacks when Mr. Romero-Figueroa's wife called her for help. She said that she felt that the police were not doing enough to protect Hispanics , including letting them know they were being singled out for attacks.

""They did not want people to know what was going on,"" she said.

Chief Santiago of Plainfield acknowledged in an interview that he tried to keep the cases under wraps. ""We were cautious because we didn't want to let people know that there are all these Hispanic immigrants with lots of cash in their pockets,"" he said.

Many victims, Chief Santiago added, also refused to cooperate with the police. It is a problem that is common in communities with large numbers of undocumented immigrants who fear deportation, according to Hester Agudosi, chief of the New Jersey attorney general's Office of Bias Crime and Community Relations. She noted that during an investigation of six attacks in which bricks and rocks were used against Hispanics in Ocean County last year, the police discovered at least eight other incidents that had never been reported.

Ms. Salavarrieta said the police have never sufficiently reached out to the community. The Plainfield Police Department has 16 bilingual officers in its 151-member force, and though a service offers translation for 911 callers, there are no Spanish-speaking dispatchers.

As a result, people like Federico Manzilla Pineda -- a 62-year-old laborer who stands no taller than a jockey -- often end up frustrated. Mr. Pineda said in an interview that he had been attacked three times since arriving in Plainfield: once at gunpoint in July 2001; again in October 2002, when thieves took $2,500 in cash that he was carrying in a plastic bag; and finally, in January 2003.

He never filed a complaint, chiefly, he said, because the officers don't comprehend Spanish sufficiently. A Spanish-speaking officer he met through a local nonprofit agency gave him his business card, but he said he has been unable to reach him. ""When I call,"" he said in Spanish, ""they cut me off.""

This past summer, Ms. Salavarrieta and other Hispanics encouraged the Guardian Angels to open a chapter in the city. Bilingual members of the group now patrol downtown Plainfield three nights a week, helping to bridge the language problem.

But they may not be enough to solve the problem in a city struggling with poverty and crime, many local residents say.

""We've certainly engaged our Hate Crimes Task Force in this investigation,"" Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday. The police had even been hit: two of the swastikas had been painted on radio cars in the 60th Precinct.

But later yesterday, the police learned that the vandalism appeared to have been fueled by a different kind of hatred and intolerance: that of an ex-wife over her former husband's new spouse.

The first incidents occurred on Friday, when officers discovered swastikas on the two radio cars in Coney Island, and markings on the front doors of two Bay Parkway addresses in Bensonhurst and three on the doors of an Ocean Parkway synagogue, the police said. On Saturday, six more swastikas were discovered on 84th Street in Ozone Park, Queens. Yesterday, swastikas were seen on 12 more addresses in the Brooklyn neighborhoods, and three in Ozone Park.

Late yesterday, the Hate Crimes Task Force arrested Olga Abramovich, 49, of 101st Street in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The police said that she had become enraged when her former husband, Lev Abramovich, 50, of Howard Beach, Queens, married a 35-year-old. Several swastikas were accompanied by personal, spray-painted attacks at the new couple, the police said. Mr. Abramovich and his wife are Jewish, and the suspect is Russian Orthodox, the police said.

Ms. Abramovich was charged with 20 counts of criminal mischief, and a can of spray paint was recovered in her trunk, said Paul J. Browne, deputy police commissioner. He said she told the police that she used black on the mostly white police cars because it showed up better, and white for the other swastikas because it was her favorite color.

On one tape, a low male voice spoke languidly of killing. The voice addressed someone as ""son,"" and railed against economic inequalities between whites and blacks.

They include the usual expressions of intolerance: the assaulting of gays, the harassment of Muslims, the spray-painting of ""K.K.K.""

To the Editor:

A recent decision by House Republicans not to take up a Senate-passed initiative that would strengthen and expand the federal hate crimes law is disappointing, but not unexpected. In 2002, the Senate proposed a similar initiative, only to be rebuffed by House Republicans. It's particularly disturbing when statistics show that hate crimes occur at a rate of more than 25 a day in the United States.

In the 21st century, it's unthinkable that one crime occurs every hour against someone because of race, religion, ethnic origin, gender or sexual orientation. Since 9/11, hate crimes against Arab and Muslim Americans have soared.

As an organization with a long history of promoting tolerance and understanding, and helping garner support for this legislation among law enforcement nationwide, we believe that it's time for House Republicans to pass this bill so it can be signed by President Bush.

The man, Amjad Abunar, had complained that ""Go Home"" was twice spray-painted on a door of his Al Madinah Market before a fire on Aug. 6 that gutted the small delicatessen. Only last week, the graffiti and fire were cited as evidence by a Washington advocacy group that hate crimes against Muslims were on the rise in Texas.

Bond for Mr. Abunar was set at $150,000, and he remained in jail on Wednesday.

Representatives of the advocacy group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which had complained that McAllen officials were not investigating the fire as a possible hate crime, said they were stunned Wednesday to learn of Mr. Abunar's arrest.

Ibrahim Hooper, a council official in Washington, said Mr. Abunar had assured him he had nothing to do with setting the fire.

Amid heavy security, a three judge panel announced the verdict on Thursday night in a national television broadcast. The judges cited lack of proof as their reason for rejecting the prosecution's request for life sentences for the accused, but it will be a month or so before the full text of their decision will be made available.

The five men were not accused of a direct role in the attack, but were charged as accessories, part of what prosecutors called ""the local connection"" to Islamic extremist groups. ""The Iranian connection needs to be explored,"" the American Jewish Committee said in a statement urging the Argentine government ""to step up"" efforts to solve this case and a similar attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992..

Originally, 22 people, most of them officers of the corrupt Buenos Aires provincial police, were accused of being involved in the theft and sale of a van that was used to blow up the community center on July 18, 1994. But charges were dropped against some because of lack of evidence, and in other cases the statute of limitations ran out before trial. Five of the 22 ultimately went on trial, starting on Sept. 24, 2001.

But the case began to fall apart late last year, when the magistrate in charge of the investigation stage, Juan José Galeano, was ousted because he had approved a $400,000 payment to one of the defendants who in turn implicated others.

The pace of such acts has accelerated since April, raising fears that the two strains of anti-Semitism were spreading among a new generation in France.

''If people are simulating anti-Semitic acts, it's because we are in a climate in which anti-Semitic acts are believable,'' said Roger Benarrosh, vice president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France, or CRIF. He said the hoaxes should not detract from the fact that there has been a resurgence of anti-Semitism in France.

This year through July, the Justice Ministry registered 298 anti-Semitic acts in France, 160 of them violent, more than double the number reported in the same period last year. The French branch of the World Jewish Congress said its figures put the number of incidents so far this year at 375.

The hate is coming from several directions.

Some analysts say the encroachment of globalization on national cultures has reawakened Europe's latent anti-Semitism among France's alienated white youth. Others attribute the growing anti-Semitism to a pro-Palestinian bias in French media coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Some people say it is spreading from Germany.

''One source is the traditional extreme right, which is represented in the French political arena by the National Front, then you have the extreme left, which is anti-Zionist and gives a kind of legitimacy to anti-Semitism,'' said Roger Cukierman, the president of CRIF. ''Then you have pro-Palestinian Muslim youths who are facing the problem of nonintegration in French society, and they are looking for scapegoats.''

The trend has alarmed French politicians and tainted the country's carefully cultivated postwar identity as an increasingly multicultural land of tolerance. France has passed a stiff new law that threatens penalties of up to life in prison for some religious or racially motivated crimes. After the fire at the Paris center, the city's mayor, Bertrand Delanoe, said he would spend 300,000 euros, about $360,000, to secure Jewish sites.

But the issue has been muddled by the arrest on Monday and by other high-profile incidents in which apparent anti-Semitic acts turned out to have more complex motivations.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In July, a 23-year-old French woman, Marie Leblanc, stunned the nation by claiming that Muslim youths had attacked her and her child on a suburban commuter train and had drawn swastikas on her stomach. She soon confessed to making up the story, leading to criticism of French officials for quickly lending credence to her claims.

Earlier this month, dozens of tombstones in a cemetery in the southern French city of Lyon were scrawled with swastikas and anti-Semitic slurs.

A week later, a man turned himself in to the police and said he had written the graffiti because his earlier attack with a hatchet on a Muslim man in Lyon had not prompted the news media response that he had wanted. He said he had decided to desecrate the Jewish graves when a similar neo-Nazi incident in the northern French region of Alsace made the front pages of newspapers across the country.

The Aug. 22 fire in Paris also made headlines, and drew swift reactions from French politicians. Swastikas and statements like, ''The world would be pure if there were no more Jews,'' had been written inside the building before it was set ablaze, suggesting that it was a neo-Nazi attack. Justice Minister Dominique Perben called for a ''war on racism.''

Corsica has a long history of resisting outsiders and has been home to a simmering independence movement since the 1960's. That movement has depended largely on homemade bombs, which have become an almost daily feature of Corsican life.

By the 1980's there were 600 to 700 explosions a year, and sometimes dozens of detonations within hours of each other on what Corsicans called ''blue nights,'' a reference to the flashes from the bombs. There were 295 blasts last year, and while the pace has somewhat slowed there is still, on average, one explosion on the island every other day.

Police stations are a favorite target, but some attacks are aimed at vacation homes built by French mainlanders or foreign nationals, who Corsican separatists say are slowly colonizing the island. Some attacks are meant to settle scores or warn off commercial competition.

More recently, though, the island's growing Arab community has become a target. While those bombings still account for only a small fraction of the attacks, nearly everyone here seems to recognize that there is something more sinister about them.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Corsica's Arab population has increased sharply over the past 30 years, primarily from Moroccans imported by former French colonials who fled newly independent Algeria in the 1960's to work the fields here. North African Arabs now represent at least 10 percent of the island's 260,000 people.

There was little problem for the original immigrants, but as their children have taken their place in society, competing with Corsicans in the island's sparse economy, problems have grown. Most people agree that anti-Arab sentiment came to the fore after the Sept. 11 attacks.

''What concerns me is that many Corsican teenagers today are viscerally anti-Arab,'' said Christophe Raffin, a local magistrate, whose daughters have been pressured to take sides in Corsican-Arab schoolyard disputes.

The trouble has accelerated since last year, after tension between young Arabs and Corsicans in Bastia's crumbling old quarter erupted into a brawl along the narrow Rue Droite, a street that is now predominantly inhabited by Arabs. The government counted 60 racist incidents in 2003 and already lists 35 this year -- nearly double the rate in the rest of France.

Of 115 bombings in the first seven months of this year, ten have taken aim at Arabs and eight of those have been clearly identified as racially motivated, in most cases because they were accompanied by racist graffiti or followed by claims of responsibility by racist groups.

About one out of every five car burnings -- the island's second most popular rebel sport -- is also directed at Arabs and in recent months Arabs have drawn gunfire as well: one North African farm worker in the coastal village of Olmeto took a bullet in the leg from an unknown assailant in June.

Anti-Arab graffiti has spread over the picturesque island, whose main business is catering to tourists. ''Arabs, the suitcase or the coffin,'' reads one spray-painted slogan.

Many people attribute the growing racism to the island's own frustrated independence movement, whose ''Corsicans First'' platform implicitly assigns secondary status to Arabs and other non-Corsican groups.

After the Wafa Bank explosion, a previously unknown group calling itself Clandestini Corsi issued a statement saying: ''These actions have a precise goal: to stop the immigration that for too many years has gnawed at this island.''

But leaders of the independence movement have been quick to distance themselves from the anti-Arab violence, saying that the French government wants to conjoin the two in order to discredit Corsican nationalists.

''We've nothing to do with this,'' said Jean-Guy Talamoni, head of the Corsican nationalists in the island's provincial legislature. ''Corsicans have themselves been the victim of racism, we are part of the antiracist movement.''

He argues that Corsica is open to anyone who wants to build a future on the island, though he wants voting on local matters to be restricted to people who have lived here at least 10 years.

Many Arabs, though, have begun questioning whether they have a future in Corsica. Some began moving to the European mainland two years ago, largely to escape the unemployment and high cost of living here. Now, many are leaving to escape the racist attacks.

Muhammad el-Yousfi, a butcher now settled in southern France, says his businesses were attacked five times before he finally decided to leave the island. ''As soon as an Arab succeeds there, someone is unhappy,'' Mr. Yousfi said, sitting at a cafe near his new butcher shop in Montpellier.

His father arrived in Corsica from Morocco in 1963 to work in a butcher shop, and Mr. Yousfi grew up on the island and opened his own butcher shop, selling meat from animals slaughtered according to Muslim rules. But the shop was ransacked in 2000, and the next year a sport utility vehicle rammed through the front window of a second butcher shop he opened outside of town.

In 2002, a bomb destroyed the front of the second shop and the next year his original shop was bombed, and then bombed again last year. He still owns the businesses in Corsica, but he has moved his family to France.

Neo-Nazism is abhorred by the vast majority of French people and is not ''tolerated'' in France. In fact, we have established a ''zero tolerance'' policy against anti-Semitism in any form.

As President Jacques Chirac says, when a Jew is attacked in France, it is an attack against the whole of France.

Police investigators in France and Germany are working together against neo-Nazi groups. The French Parliament unanimously passed one of the toughest laws in Europe to punish racist, anti-Semitic or xenophobic offenses. An Interministerial Committee on Fighting Racism and Anti-Semitism has been set up under the authority of the prime minister to monitor the situation regularly.

In June, France held a meeting in Paris of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to promote a coordinated approach toward Internet sites that facilitate unacceptable racist or anti-Semitic speech.

There has long been resentment here over the botched investigation, but the anger has grown in recent months as a result of the train bombings that killed 190 people in Madrid in March. Although the Spanish government initially blamed the attack on Basque separatists, its ability to identify and apprehend fairly quickly the people suspected of being Islamic militant organizers has been repeatedly contrasted here with the Argentine government's ineptitude or unwillingness to act.

In recent months, there has also been talk here of seeking ''a Lockerbie solution,'' in which Argentina would relinquish some of its legal claims so that the accused Iranians could stand trial in a third country. But Iran, which threatened to ''adopt appropriate measures'' if Argentina did not revoke the indictments, has offered no indication it is interested in such a deal.

With the recent release of government documents, ordered by Mr. Kirchner, Jewish community groups are also pushing for a belated investigation into a Syrian link to the attack. Among the questions they have raised is why Mr. Menem, himself of Syrian descent, allowed various Syrian citizens who were then under surveillance to leave Argentina in the wake of the bombing, including one who is said to be a cousin of Hafez al-Assad, who was then the president of Syria.

Mr. Kirchner, who took office 14 months ago, is the first Argentine president to attend the annual AMIA ceremonies. In April, he described the unsolved case as such ''a national disgrace'' that it required him to ''find the historical truth,'' and on Sunday he was hugged, kissed and greeted with cries of ''keep on pushing, Mr. President,'' by relatives of many of the victims.

But his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, generated criticism last week when in an interview with a local Jewish publication she suggested that some Jewish leaders aided in the cover-up. Mrs. Kirchner, a prominent senator and member of a legislative commission that also investigated the bombing, was understood to be referring to an ally of Mr. Menem who controlled a financially troubled bank that received questionable government support.

Mr. Kirchner is scheduled to meet Monday with members of a delegation representing the American Jewish Committee. In an interview, David A. Harris, executive director of the group, said resolving the AMIA case will ''require extraordinary political will and courage'' and urged Mr. Kirchner ''to translate good intentions into concrete results.''

''Manipulations may happen, and those manipulations are the result of the bad climate that has developed,'' he said.

Mr. Chirac ranged wide in the interview, making a surprise announcement toward the end that France would hold a referendum in the second half of 2005 on ratifying the European Union's first constitution, and declining to comment on the American presidential campaign. Iraq was not mentioned.

He vowed that France would enforce the ban on Muslim head scarves in schools this fall, and admitted that the country's effort to integrate people of different religions and ethnic backgrounds into the fabric of French society was not succeeding.

''We are currently in a situation where integration doesn't work well,'' he said.

Still, Mr. Chirac also defended his condemnation last Saturday of the reported attack on the woman in the commuter train, identified as Marie Leblanc.

The woman, who turned out to have a history of filing complaints for assaults that were never proved, told the police that six men of North African and African origin attacked her on a commuter train north of Paris after they mistakenly identified her as a Jew and overturned the stroller that held her 13-month-old baby.

''It is an unfortunate story,'' Mr. Chirac said of the hoax. ''But I do not regret what I said the other day.''

The story continued to dominate the front pages of Wednesday's newspapers, which began to analyze why everyone from the president and the police to newspaper reporters got it so wrong.

Under the headline ''The Mistake and the Challenge,'' an editorial in Le Monde said, ''The highest levels of the state gave credibility to the lies of a mythomaniac.'' It added that Le Monde had also made a mistake, saying: ''We owe apologies to the youth of the suburbs who are of immigrant North African or African origin, wrongly stigmatized. We also owe apologies to our readers who can rightly reproach us for not having left sufficient space for doubt.''

The left-leaning Libération also apologized to readers, saying, ''The lesson is hard, and apologies, ours, like those of all the players in this situation, are necessary.''

Mr. Chirac, meanwhile, also deplored racism in France, saying: ''We are going through a period of displays of racism in which our compatriots, Jews, Muslim or even others, sometimes even simply French people, are the object of aggression with the only motive that they don't belong or are not from such and such a community. This is unacceptable. It's the very opposite of our social pact, of the morals to which we are attached.''

The suggestion that Jews or Muslims are separate from French people was apparently a slip of the tongue. But it was reminiscent of the words of Raymond Barre, then prime minister, after a bomb attack on a Paris synagogue in 1980, when he deplored the fact that ''Jews and innocent French were wounded.''

Racist acts and statements, not only against Jews but also against Muslims, have increased in France, and Mr. Chirac and his cabinet are quick to condemn any act that is defined as racist.

Mr. Chirac's interview was broadcast both on national television and on a giant screen framed by red drapes and gold gilt in the main ''Salon of Celebrations'' at Élysée Palace.

The interview was the centerpiece of the Bastille Day party at the palace, one of the most festive events of the year in which thousands of guests stroll the garden, sip Champagne and dip into dishes from all corners of France.

In announcing that France will hold a referendum on the European Union constitution, Mr. Chirac follows the lead of several others of its members, including Britain and Spain. The constitution has to be approved by the 25 member nations of the union to be enacted. While Prime Minister Tony Blair's decision to hold a referendum created a stir in Britain, opinion polls in France consistently show that the French favor efforts to strengthen the union.

Until now, however, Mr. Chirac had resisted moving toward a referendum, knowing full well that it could be interpreted as a one on his administration. One of his fiercest political rivals, Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, has already openly endorsed the idea of a referendum, and he has pushed Mr. Chirac's conservative party, the Union for a Popular Movement, into accepting it as well.

Mr. Chirac used the interview to take on Mr. Sarkozy, who has declared himself a candidate for president in 2007 and outperforms his boss in popularity polls.

Mr. Chirac, who is 71, made clear that if his ambitious 49-year-old minister wins a race for the leadership of the party, he will be fired from his ministerial post. Mr. Sarkozy, who sees the party leadership as a stepping stone toward the presidency, wants both jobs.

''He must quit immediately or I will immediately relieve him of his duties,'' Mr. Chirac said.

In a modern-day version of Louis XIV's ''L'état, c'est moi,'' Mr. Chirac also made it clear who is in charge. ''I decide, he implements,'' Mr. Chirac said of his relationship with Mr. Sarkozy. The audience watching the performance burst into laughter.

When one of the two interviewers reminded Mr. Chirac that he himself was both prime minister and head of a party once, the president replied: ''Yes, but I never came to the headquarters of the party. Everybody knew it.'' Once again, the audience laughed.

At another point, Mr. Chirac insisted, ''I don't have any problems with Nicolas Sarkozy,'' a statement that also elicited some audible snickering.

Mr. Sarkozy, whose popularity rose during his time as the country's tough law-and-order interior minister, has been finance minister only since March, when Mr. Chirac shuffled his cabinet after a brutal defeat in regional elections.

The suspect, Salvatore Maceli, 26, of Valley Stream, was one of several people involved in a confrontation with the Sikh, Rajinder Singh Khalsa Ji, 54, who was punched and kicked into unconsciousness, investigators said. Mr. Maceli, who is charged with assault, faces up to four years in prison if convicted under a 2000 state law that classifies racially and ethnically motivated assaults as hate crimes, and the police said others who participated in the attack may also be charged.

Mr. Khalsa Ji, a limousine driver from Queens and a spiritual leader for Sikhs in New York City, had been walking with another Sikh man past a catering hall, Il Palazzo di Villa Russo, at Lefferts Boulevard and 101st Street in Richmond Hill, when the assault occurred.

If that is so, his killing would represent an escalation of the recent wave of racial violence to include not only Muslims, Jews and migrants from Africa and Asia, but also one of the most prominent defenders of their rights.

''This has brought us to a turning point,'' Aleksandr Y. Vinnikov, a writer and human-rights campaigner, said at a memorial service held for Mr. Girenko on Thursday at St. Petersburg State University beside the Neva River. ''Either the society and the government recognize the dangers and take measures, including the use of force, or the murderers will get away with it, and Russia will take the course of the Weimar Republic.''

Mr. Girenko, an ethnologist who spent decades studying African cultures, had in recent years become an expert on one of the darkest undercurrents of Russia's post-Soviet experience: a proliferation of loosely organized groups embracing the credo of Nazi-like ethnic supremacy and, all too often, expressing it in brazen assaults on minorities.

He fulminated against racial and ethnic hatred in his research and provided expert testimony for prosecutors trying (half-heartedly, many here say) to fight its adherents. Most recently he participated in criminal cases against epithet-spewing nationalist newspapers and a neo-Nazi group that calls itself Schultz-88, a coded reference to Hitler.

St. Petersburg's prosecutors have vowed to solve Mr. Girenko's killing, assigning 120 investigators and turning the case over to a newly created department that specializes in hate crimes. Even so, officials have still not ruled out the possibility that he was the victim of some random crime or hooliganism, an euphemism often used in cases of ethnic violence, including the stabbing death of a 9-year-old Tajik girl in February and that of the son of Libya's cultural attaché this month.

Mr. Girenko's daughter and colleagues called that notion preposterous, saying the circumstances of the shooting indicated he had been singled out.

Nikolai A. Vinnichenko, the city's chief prosecutor, even suggested that Mr. Girenko's own work was hampering the investigation: he had studied so many hate groups that the pool of potential suspects was huge. ''The results of his work were vital to the investigations of criminal cases in many regions of the country,'' he told the Interfax news agency.

A little-known nationalist group, Russian Republic, published a letter on its Web site saying it sentenced Mr. Girenko to death, citing his testimony in several criminal cases against ''Russian patriots'' and his booklet for prosecutors and police officers.

''I consider N. M. Girenko a staunch and incorrigible enemy of the Russian people and I sentence him to the highest degree of punishment,'' a man identified as V. Y. Popov wrote.

A spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office said the letter was under investigation, but other officials quoted in Russian news reports discounted the document, saying that while it was dated a week before Mr. Girenko's killing, it only appeared afterward.

Few believe that the killers will be caught, and not only because of the dearth of evidence and witnesses.

Despite a series of heinous racial crimes in St. Petersburg, including at least eight killings in the past 18 months, the authorities here and elsewhere in Russia have tended to play down the prevalence of neo-Nazi or skinhead groups. Groups that track them estimate, though, that they have 50,000 active members.

Sergei D. Khakhayev, chairman of the St. Petersburg branch of the rights organization Memorial, said the reason many government and law enforcement officials were reluctant to address racial hatred was that they harbored their own biases against non-Russian ethnic groups, if less stridently or openly.

''Unfortunately, culture is only one side of our city,'' he said. ''Another side exists. It is enough to walk around the city and see swastikas on the walls, the slogans that say 'Russia for Russians.' And the authorities do nothing.''

Mr. Girenko's colleagues said his calling came from deeply rooted passion against all forms of extremism. He was a year old when the Nazis laid siege to the city, then known as Leningrad. Valentina G. Uzunova, who worked closely with him, said Mr. Girenko could not understand how, given the city's history, anyone here could hold such views.

He developed his expertise about hate groups during the chaotic years that accompanied the unraveling of the Soviet Union, when enforcement of intellectual conformity was lifted, allowing free expression to flourish, even in its most hateful forms. He also became active in politics, winning election to the city's local parliament as a member of a liberal party, Democratic Russia, and speaking out on human rights.

''When I tried to talk him out of getting involved in politics, he said, 'If not me, who else?' '' Mr. Girenko's wife, Valentina, said in an interview in their apartment, where he was born and lived most his life.

In his work with law enforcement, Mr. Girenko studied the literature of neo-Nazi groups, demonstrating how the language they used in publications and on the Internet constituted incitement to ethnically motivated violence.

Ms. Uzunova said it was monotonous and difficult work, complicated by prosecutors' reluctance to accept racially tinged calls for action against minority groups as evidence of premeditation, for example. He wrote the booklet for investigators as a result. She was working with him on an expanded version for other experts like themselves. Neither of them was paid for the work.

But Democrats, who lost a similar battle last year, said that the research would spur other nations to turn to such weapons and that even bombs exploding underground would pose risks of fallout far beyond their targets. That the administration has budgeted $485 million over five years for the so-called bunker buster is evidence that the Pentagon already intends to move beyond research, said the opponents, led by Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Dianne Feinstein of California.

Backers of the administration denied that a decision to produce the weapons had already been made, saying money was included in projections of future budgets only in case Congress gave approval.

Taken together, the votes in the Senate and the House have made clear that Congress will be battling over this issue throughout the summer.

The hate crimes proposal was pushed by Mr. Kennedy and Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon. Mr. Smith called the change in the definition ''long overdue'' and said it was relevant to the Pentagon legislation because of violent crimes that have been committed against gay members of the armed forces.

''You cannot fight terror abroad and accept terror at home,'' he said.

Similar measures have been passed by the Senate before but have been stripped from final bills. This time, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Smith said, they believe that the strong show of support in the vote will give them leverage in talks with the House. They also have assurances from the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, that he will back the language in those negotiations on the overall bill.

Some Senate Republicans criticized the proposal, saying that it would require the authorities to try to ascertain the psychological motive for a crime and that there was no evidence that offenses against the specified groups were not being prosecuted now.

Mississippi's attorney general, Jim Hood, like his predecessor, has said he is considering reopening the case. But as the years go by, more and more witnesses and suspects die. Even so, at least half of the 18 men who were originally tried on federal civil rights charges in 1967 are still around, many living in this sparsely populated rural county about 70 miles northeast of Jackson. Seven were convicted of conspiracy. None served more than six years in prison.

Healing will not be easy for Philadelphia, which has become one of the more integrated places in Mississippi. While blacks, 40 percent of the population, have long been pressing for a re-examination of the case, many older whites resist. More than a few scoff at the prospect of Philadelphia's becoming an official site on the growing civil rights tourism circuit.

Linda Jenkins, who owns Carousel Gifts, Pools and Spa, just across from the Neshoba County Courthouse, offers the commonly held view that events of the summer of 1964 should be left alone. ''It's part of history and we can't sweep it under the rug, but we have to move on,'' said Ms. Jenkins, 50, who is white. ''The less said about it the better.''

In early May, the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation in another Mississippi racial slaying, the 1955 killing of 14-year-old Emmett Till.

Not that the events of the past have gone entirely unnoted. Mount Zion Methodist Church, whose burning by the Ku Klux Klan that summer lured the three civil rights workers to the county, has held a quiet memorial service each June for decades and has erected its own commemorative markers. In 1989 some residents organized a 25th-anniversary event that prompted a public apology by the Mississippi secretary of state.

But such things have not erased the stigma that many people say still shadows them. Don Kilgore, 55, a local lawyer who is white, says he sometimes dreads telling people where he is from when he travels. ''People have this idea that we're backwards and racist, and the lack of any conclusion to the case lends credence to those feelings,'' he said.

Mr. Kilgore and others say they find the notoriety especially troubling because Philadelphia has come so far since the summer of 1964.

Philadelphia's public schools are integrated, the Klan has been moribund for decades, and blacks and whites alike describe the city as a nurturing and tolerant place. ''There's no question that life here has changed for the better,'' said Elsie Kirksey, 46, a Mount Zion parishioner whose cousins were beaten by the Klan that summer. ''We no longer live in fear.''

In 1964, fear ruled the lives of many people in Neshoba County, black as well as white. It was Freedom Summer and hundreds of volunteers from the North flocked here to organize black voter registration drives. To the Klan, the civil rights workers were invaders, and their arrival helped the local Klan recruit as many as 250 members.

They were especially infuriated, according to the F.B.I., by Mr. Schwerner, 24, a New Yorker who had opened a community center for blacks in nearby Meridian. After the firebombing of Mount Zion, he drove Mr. Goodman and Mr. Chaney to the church to inspect the ruins. Later that day they were arrested by Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price for speeding and held long enough for Klan leaders to organize two carloads of men. Once released from jail, the three were chased down in their Ford station wagon, shot and buried on the farm of one of the city's wealthiest citizens.

Six weeks later, after one of the largest F.B.I. manhunts in history, the bodies were found. Among those arrested were Mr. Price, the Neshoba County sheriff and a preacher. The identities of the killers were widely believed to be known around town, and to this day, Stanley Dearman, then a reporter for a nearby newspaper, wonders why no one stood up.

''Of course there was a lot of fear,'' Mr. Dearman said. ''But there was also a lot of sympathy.''

Mr. Dearman went on to become the editor of The Neshoba Democrat. He said he adored his community but remained plagued by the memories of those turbulent years. For decades, he has been one of the most persistent advocates for reopening the case.

Mr. Dearman, who is 71 and retired, says that every time he drives by the jail, now an office building, he is reminded of the killed men. ''I can say without exaggeration that in 40 years, not a single day has gone by that I don't think about those boys,'' he said. ''It's just something you can't wash off. People may not want to talk about it but it will never go away. The thing won't let us forget.''

As a native Mississippian among Mississippians, I hope I am not in the minority by saying I am glad that the Emmett Till case is being reopened (''U.S. Reopens '55 Murder Case, Flashpoint of Civil Rights Era,'' front page, May 11).

Here in the South, we are often reminded of the pain of Jim Crow, and the scars of racism have yet to be fully healed. But by facing our past and admitting the wrongs done, we continue to heal those wounds.

The 2001 conviction of Thomas E. Blanton, who plotted the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., that killed four black girls, and the 1994 conviction of Byron De La Beckwith, 31 years after he murdered Medgar Evers in cold blood, atone for the past and set the record straight.

The death of Emmett Till sent the South down a long and arduous path that ended at freedom's door. His brutal and untimely death was not in vain.

We, down here especially, cannot forget what happened. As a great Mississippi novelist once wrote, ''The past is not dead; it is not even past.''

It included a moment of silence at midday, followed by the reading of Ms. Gunn's name and the names of 25 other Newark school children who had died in accidents or because of violence since 2002.

Carol Patterson Brooks, a spokeswoman for the Newark district, said the day was set aside to remember Ms. Gunn and to reinforce not only a ''tolerance of differences'' but a celebration of them. According to the Newark police, Ms. Gunn and four of her friends were waiting for a bus at a downtown bus stop at 3:30 a.m. when they were approached by two men in a car who made advances. When they were rebuffed, the men got out of their car, the police said, and a shoving match began, which escalated into a scuffle when one of the girls told them that they were lesbians and not interested in men. It was in that struggle that the stabbing occurred, the police said. The men fled.

A group representing the families of gay teenagers released a letter it said came from Richard McCullough, who has been accused of murder in Ms. Gunn's death and has also been charged under the state's bias crime law. The letter said that the stabbing was an accident caused by the person who attacked him and his friends because they argued with a group of girls.

''This little dude pounced on me and into the knife that I held in my hand,'' Mr. McCullough, 30, wrote in to the group, Parents and Families of Lesbians and Gays, in February. ''I never wanted or intended to hurt him or anybody else. I never knew he was a she filled with such hate and aggression over a simple argument and nothing more.''

Mr. McCullough, who surrendered two days after the stabbing, is being held in the Essex County Jail on $500,000 bail. His lawyer, John McMahon, said that he was ''aware of no such letter'' from his client and said that he would have to ask him about it before commenting.

Emmett Till, a Chicagoan who was visiting relatives in Money, Miss., that August, was dragged from his bed, beaten, shot and dropped in the Tallahatchie River after he had been accused of whistling at a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, in her family's store. The image of Emmett's battered body in an open coffin at his funeral in Chicago became a galvanizing moment in the civil rights movement, particularly for many Northerners removed from the brutalities of the Jim Crow era.

Testimony from witnesses linked two white men -- Carolyn Bryant's husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, J. W. Milam -- to the crime. But an all-white jury acquitted them after the defense appealed to the jurors' white heritage. The defendants later gloated about the killing and provided gruesome details about the torture and murder in a Look magazine article. Both are now dead.

Mr. Acosta of the Justice Department called the acquittals a ''gross miscarriage of justice'' that moved the country to begin to confront the racism and segregation of the South.

The federal government did not investigate the case at the time, despite numerous pleas, and the five-year statute of limitations then in place for federal civil rights crimes has long expired.

But if others are now implicated, they could still be prosecuted by the State of Mississippi on charges of murder or perhaps other crimes, officials said. Mr. Acosta said that officials had already conducted a preliminary review into the new information and that federal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents would work with the local authorities in Mississippi.

''At the end of the day, there may not be a prosecutable crime, but it's a case of such importance that it's worth taking a chance to see what's there,'' said a senior Justice Department official speaking on condition of anonymity.

Simeon Wright, a cousin of Emmett who shared a bed with him the night he was abducted, said he had been waiting for justice in the case most of his life.

''I'm elated by this,'' said Mr. Wright, a retired pipe fitter who lives in Chicago. ''It's a great decision. Something had to be done.''

Mr. Wright said the killing fractured what had once been a close-knit family, and relatives fled Mississippi for Chicago soon after the defendants were acquitted. His father, a cotton farmer who stood up in court to point out the accused men, had to leave most of the family's possessions behind, Mr. Wright said.

''Our world was never the same after that,'' he said.

The re-examination of the case was prompted in part by Keith Beauchamp, 32, a filmmaker from New York City who spent the last nine years making a documentary about the killing. Mr. Beauchamp said that based on his research, he believed five people were still alive who were involved in or had knowledge of the killing. Emmett's mother, Mamie Till Mobley, who died last year, was involved in the making of the film.

In recent years, Mr. Beauchamp has toured the country showing a partly completed version of his film, ''The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,'' to drum up public support for a re-examination of the case. He has met with the federal authorities to plead his case and has also enlisted the help of members of Congress like Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Charles B. Rangel, both Democrats of New York.

Mr. Schumer said in an interview that he was ''pleasantly surprised'' by the Justice Department decision, but that investigators should now move quickly.

''Time is of the essence because so many of the witnesses and even the possible conspirators are older,'' he said. ''In a case like this, justice delayed should not be justice denied.''

A second filmmaker, Stanley Nelson of Manhattan, produced and directed a 2003 documentary titled ''The Murder of Emmett Till'' that has been broadcast on PBS and is scheduled to receive a Peabody Award next week. That documentary has also been reviewed by the Justice Department, officials said.

Mr. Nelson said he was hopeful the investigation would lead to charges against others.

''There were a number of people who had evidence about the murder who did not testify at the time because they were scared,'' he said. ''We were able to go to Mississippi and find people in a week or two who had evidence to give. So if you have trained investigators with subpoena powers, who knows what will come of this?''

As part of his documentary, Mr. Nelson said, he interviewed a Mississippi man, Oudie Brown, who remembered seeing another man cleaning up blood shortly after the killing. ''That's Emmett Till's blood,'' Mr. Brown said the other man had told him.

The Till murder is one of several civil rights cases that have been reopened long after most people thought they had been consigned to the history books. In 1994 in Jackson, Miss., a jury of eight blacks and four whites took six hours to convict Byron De La Beckwith, then 73, in the 1963 slaying of the civil rights leader Medgar Evers. Mr. Beckwith, a white segregationist, had been tried twice in 1964; both times the all-white juries had deadlocked.

Last year the Justice Department helped convict a 72-year-old former Klansman, Ernest Avants, in the 1966 slaying of a black sharecropper, Ben Chester White. The slaying was part of a plot, prosecutors said, to kill the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

In trials in 2002 and 2001, two former Klansmen were convicted in the 1963 church bombing that killed four girls in Birmingham, Ala.

The re-examination of the Emmett Till killing came a week after the Justice Department announced an agreement forcing Cracker Barrel restaurants to ban discrimination against black diners.

Civil rights advocates were divided over whether the developments in the Till and Cracker Barrel cases represented a more aggressive posture under Mr. Acosta's leadership or politically motivated moves in an election year.

The assault, in which officials said one victim was cut with a sickle and another with a broken bottle, led to community soul-searching about racism on Staten Island and the suspension without pay of two police officers who, the college student said, discouraged her from making a complaint after the incident.

The indictment was the first on Staten Island under the Hate Crime Act of 2000. An assault designated as a hate crime is prosecuted as a charge one degree higher than it would be otherwise.

''These indictments send the message that crimes involving bias and prejudice on Staten Island will be thoroughly investigated and vigorously prosecuted by this administration and that anyone who engages in this kind of criminal behavior will face the appropriate consequences,'' Mr. Donovan, a Republican who took office in January, said in a written statement.

Mario Gallucci, the lawyer for Mr. Rudge, expressed incredulity at the hate-crime part of the indictment. ''Did a fight happen? Without a doubt,'' he said. ''Was it racially motivated? I don't think so.''

Joseph Sorrentino, a lawyer for Mr. Improta, said the grand jury was controlled by prosecutors. ''We will wait for our day in court to present our defense, and we are confident that my client will be exonerated,'' he said. Lawyers for Mr. Zitelli did not return a call for comment.",nytimes.com,True

Brown, the Queens District Attorney, said.

The woman, Donna Harding, a 41-year-old budget analyst from Breezy Point, Queens, was accused of using racial epithets after she encountered the girl and her mother outside a bar in Breezy Point, a gated community on the western tip of the Rockaways. The girl and her mother were the guests of a Breezy Point resident, officials have said.The original, more serious charges against Ms. Harding were dismissed after she and the victim agreed that Ms. Harding would plead guilty to disorderly conduct, a spokesman for Mr. Brown said. Those charges included third-degree assault as a hate crime, a felony punishable by up to four years in prison.

Law enforcement officials said Ms. Harding shoved a plastic wagon into the girl's legs and had earlier told the girl and her mother that blacks and Hispanics did not belong in Breezy Point and that they should ''go back to Orchard Beach'' in the Bronx.",nytimes.com,True

''It's not necessarily a professional job, nor is it completely amateur,'' said an investigative official here. ''It's somewhere between the two.''

The police have found traces of triacetone triperoxide on the wreckage of Mr. Dermouche's car, which was destroyed in early Jan. 18, just four days after his appointment to his new job was announced.

Triacetone triperoxide, known as TATP, is a dangerously unstable explosive favored by many violent groups because of its ease of manufacture from commonly available ingredients: nail polish remover, acid and bleach.

Its use suggests a well thought out campaign against Mr. Dermouche by one or more persons willing to take significant risks. The substance formed part of the bomb discovered in the shoes of Richard Reid, suspected of being a member of Al Qaeda, while he was aboard a flight from Paris to Miami in 2001.

''It's not just a Molotov cocktail,'' the investigative official said.

The first bomb was slipped between the windshield and hood of Mr. Dermouche's car. The second bomb, on Sunday, shattered glass doors at Mr. Dermouche's former business school.

The bomb on Thursday was slipped through a letter slot on a wooden door of his son's school building and blew apart an interior mail box. There were no injuries or witnesses in any of the bombings.

The official said investigators were not ruling out any hypothesis about who was behind the attacks. He said that it could turn out to be someone with a personal grudge against Mr. Dermouche and who was angered by his recent appointment.

But the official said that at least five people had called several news and government agencies to claim responsibility for the bombings on behalf of various right-wing, anti-immigration causes.

After the first bombing, the police detained the boyfriend of Mr. Dermouche's former wife because there had been open animosity between the men. But the man was released and the official said the subsequent bombings made it unlikely that he was involved.

Mr. Dermouche, 57, was born to a farming family in a small Algerian village and moved to France when he was 18, part of a wave of Algerian immigrants who arrived in the wake of that country's violent war of independence. He earned a doctorate in social science before obtaining the French equivalent of an M.B.A.

After completing his studies, Mr. Dermouche began teaching at a small but respected business school in Nantes. He became director of the school in 1989 and soon gave the school an international presence by establishing partnerships with dozens of business schools abroad. Mr. Dermouche, who declined to be interviewed for this article, also used the school as a means for connecting with France's power elite, inviting well-known personalities to lecture his students. The institution, now called Nantes' Audencia School of Management, is regarded as one of France's top business schools.

But despite Mr. Dermouche's success, his appointment as prefect in Jura has created a stir because it appeared to many people to be an example of affirmative action, a policy that is technically prohibited in France. He will start his new job the week of Feb. 9.

President Jacques Chirac has insisted that France will not adopt the policy, but the interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, contends that the country's frustrated immigrants need help in winning positions of responsibility.

France attracted tens of thousands of North African immigrants during the economic boom that followed World War II. While immigration was all but stopped in the early 1980's, the country has since been troubled by the social strains of absorbing those immigrants and their French-born children, many of whom are Muslims.

''I asked the question, where are you guys?''

One of the reasons for the silence is that few agree that the attack was ethnically motivated. In interviews last week, several prominent Russian residents said they saw the attack as an unfortunate isolated incident carried out by a particular group of troublemakers, and not as a signal of some broader tensions between Russian immigrants and Hispanics in Brooklyn.

''It was just this certain group of hooligans,'' said Anatoly Eyzenberg, owner of Brighton King Meats and a member of a Russian-American political organization called Pravo.

''I don't want to inflame ethnic hatred'' with speeches, he said. ''I'm categorically against that.''

Many details of the attack are still unclear. Mr. Charnavus, and four other men, all Russian speakers, tried to buy alcohol about 1 a.m. at a small restaurant on Knickerbocker Avenue, the police and witnesses said. The server told them they would have to stay to drink it, so they went instead to a bodega, the server's sister said.

The trouble started outside the bodega, when a group of seven Hispanic men and teenagers mistook Mr. Charnavus and his group for Poles and shouted ethnic slurs, the police said. A fight ensued, and Mr. Charnavus was critically injured. He died last Tuesday. The other men suffered less serious injuries.

The police have yet to say definitively that the attack was ethnically motivated. It is possible detectives will conclude it was simply a fight between two groups of men, a Police Department spokeswoman said on Friday.

But a person acquainted with the victims said they tried to escape. The victims, the person said, spoke virtually no English, and probably did not understand what was being said to them.

''They weren't robbed,'' said the person, who asked not to be identified. ''They didn't start the fight. When they tried to get away, the bats and knives came out.''

One Bushwick resident, Adam Huertas, 20, who was on the block the night it happened, said the fight was a misunderstanding that got out of control.

''One said something, then the other said something,'' Mr. Huertas said of the encounter. ''It wasn't racial,'' he said.

He added, ''It was wrong.''

But another resident, who declined to give his name, acknowledged ethnicity has been an element in neighborhood disputes. ''A lot of it is turf,'' the resident said. ''It's to say: 'This side is dangerous. Don't come over to this side.'''

Whichever version proves true, the city's Russians are still not turning to public action in this case. The reasons can be traced back to their homeland. Decades of being force-fed politics in the Soviet era, when participation in Labor Day demonstrations and other marches was obligatory have left many who immigrated here extremely distrustful of public forums, said some who were interviewed for this article. And while Brooklyn's ex-Soviet population has prospered and grown, it has remained underrepresented in city government.

''Most people say: 'Politics? Who cares,''' said Oleg Gutnik, a Sheepshead Bay doctor, who ran unsuccessfully in the 2001 City Council election. ''They come from the Soviet Union, where 99.9 percent of the vote was for one party. That philosophy still exists.''

The distaste for public action has meant that indignation about the killing has not spilled over into public pronouncements like Mr. Siegel's, said Leonid Rashkovsky, a spokesman for the Russian American Officers Association, a group of Russian-speaking law enforcement officers. He recently spoke about the beating on a radio show.

''I've spoken to some political activists, but they just don't seem interested,'' he said. ''I got no response. It's sad -- this guy died because he was speaking Russian, and it's going nowhere because we're not organized. There is no political power in the community.''

For many residents in the heavily Russian neighborhood of Brighton Beach, Bushwick is a distant land. When the crimes have struck closer to home, Russian residents have taken grievances to City Council members, representatives and senators, said Mark Davidovich, an immigrant Democratic leader for the 46th Assembly District.

Surf Avenue, where many elderly Russians live and many robberies had occurred, was made safer after Russian-American leaders met with local police officers and city and state officials, Mr. Davidovich said.

During the so-called Troubles, the violent 30-year conflict between Catholics and Protestants here, few immigrants, no matter how desperate, chose to settle in Northern Ireland. That slowly began to change with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ushered in a period of relative peace and prosperity.

Foreigners looking for jobs, primarily in the health care, restaurant and university sectors, started to trickle in, most of them unaware of the Byzantine rules, credos and allegiances that govern Northern Ireland. Few speak English well, and most stand out because of their skin color.

As a result, the number of attacks on foreigners has jumped sharply, particularly in the hardscrabble neighborhood called the Village in South Belfast, which is populated by people called loyalists for their fierce allegiance to the British crown. From April through December, 212 racist incidents were recorded in Northern Ireland, ranging from assault to arson, police statistics show. Five years ago, only a handful of such incidents were reported.

The violence has worsened lately. In the last two months, a six-foot plank was thrown through the window of a Pakistani home, two houses have been pipe bombed, one occupied by a Ugandan family the other by Romanians, and another Chinese family was forced to flee its home after being threatened by a gang.

Filipino nurses walking home are routinely harassed and physically threatened, said a local official of the hospital workers' union. Children are being bullied. In an interview, a local real estate agent, William Faulkner, said he was warned not to rent to foreigners before his office was firebombed. Swastikas and racist words now compete for wall space with anti-Catholic vitriol and Protestant murals of paramilitaries carrying assault weapons.

Political officials and advocates of immigrants' rights say they can pinpoint the flash points. With few exceptions, racially motivated attacks have taken place in Protestant working-class neighborhoods like the Village and on streets controlled by loyalist paramilitary groups. It is common knowledge that loyalist leaders can just as easily start trouble as end trouble in these neighborhoods, and people who fall out of line know the consequences, city and immigrant group leaders say.

''Very little goes on in those areas that people don't learn about very quickly,'' said Ken Fraser, who works for the Race Equality Unit in the office of the first minister. ''Typically, you steal cars in the wrong area and your kneecaps hear about it.''

David Ervine, leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, which represents the Ulster Voluntary Force, a loyalist paramilitary group, said that a small group of troublemakers were responsible, ''and I have no doubt that some of these are paramilitaries.''

''We certainly have a problem, but it's not so different from other communities who have been exposed to immigrants for the first time,'' he said. ''You hear, 'They are taking our jobs and our houses.' '' But to blame paramilitary leaders is to oversimplify and exaggerate their power nowadays, he said.

The city indeed finds itself struggling to stop the violence. For decades, Northern Ireland has shaped itself -- its institutions, its property maps, its laws -- through the prism of Catholic and Protestant divisions. The police department, for example, must be 50 percent Catholic, 50 percent Protestant. But there is no requirement for ethnic minorities.

Politicians are planning to toughen hate crime laws, and the city is busy forming new groups to deal with racism. But the larger problem is getting the laws enforced and people to cooperate.

''For these racial attacks, there is never any information put forward by local people,'' said Patrick Yu, head of the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities. ''No information, no arrests, no prosecutions.''

After the decades of violence, Belfast is trying to brighten its cultural and financial image in the European community, and for its mayor, Martin Morgan, quelling the attacks is crucial to dispelling the city's reputation as a violent backwater.

Racist attitudes lie deep within the Russian psyche and are growing even worse now, said Aleksandr Brod, director of the Moscow Human Rights Bureau, a private group that monitors discrimination. The driving force, he said, is the proliferation of white-supremacist skinhead groups, which enjoy widespread support and are fueled by nationalist political groups and publications.

There are now some 200 nationalist publications around the country with racial overtones, he said. In parliamentary elections earlier this month, a dozen parties campaigned on extremist nationalist agendas, with considerable success.

Although the fire is officially described as an accident, most minority students are convinced that it was arson. They say that for weeks, both before and after the fire, bomb threats forced students into the cold streets during the class day or in the middle of the night.

Perhaps it is because my 11-year-old daughter is studying the Holocaust, or maybe it is because Eva Mozes Kor, the museum's owner, suffered in Auschwitz, but I was very upset with what happened to the museum. You report that the F.B.I. is investigating the case as domestic terrorism and a possible hate crime because ''Remember Timmy McVeigh'' was found scrawled on a museum wall.

As a country, we keep focusing on eradicating terrorism far away, yet we would be prudent to keep looking in our own backyard for those who hate.

The teenager, William Lutz, 17, admitted that he was among five teenagers who, at 1 a.m. on July 5, threw a lighted fireworks rocket from a car into the Granny Road house where Maria Garcia, Sergio Perez and their two children were asleep. The family escaped injury, but the crime, which police said was bias-related, rekindled fears of anti-immigrant violence on Long Island.

The two teenagers who have pleaded guilty in the case, Mr. Lutz and Derek Brandafino, 17, were passengers in the car and not ringleaders of the crime, investigators have said.

On Wednesday, two other defendants, Scott Soucek, 16, and Kyle Mahler, 17, will appear in Suffolk County Court in Riverhead for a conference. The case of the fifth teenager, who is 15, is being handled in juvenile court.",nytimes.com,True

County Executive Andrew J. Spano announced last week that county authorities would be tracing extremist groups more closely, monitoring related Web sites and developing a training program for police officers and investigators.

''With more training and understanding of how these groups work, they'll have a much better chance of heading off any criminal or inappropriate activity before it happens,'' Mr. Spano said in a statement. The county will work with the Anti-Defamation League in developing the program, and municipalities will be encouraged to report bias and hate crimes to develop a database to determine the scope of the problem, he said.

Pro-Hitler leaflets were distributed in Irvington, Dobbs Ferry, Tarrytown and Ardsley around Halloween, and swastikas have been painted on buildings and cars in Sleepy Hollow, Yonkers and New Rochelle this fall.

In March, the Jewish Family Congregation in South Salem was vandalized with a swastika. In October, a large swastika was spray-painted on the Mid-Chester Jewish Center in Yonkers. This fall, there were other complaints about swastikas being painted on cars in New Rochelle and Yonkers. An elderly Scarsdale woman and Holocaust survivor, found a piece of hate literature from the National Socialist Movement in her driveway, while a Jewish woman, who is a board member of the American Jewish Committee, found a leaflet from the New Order on her car in a Central Avenue shopping mall parking lot earlier this fall.

Other incidents so far this year include anti-Semitic slurs written on billboards at the Dobbs Ferry train station, a swastika and racial slurs on a picnic bench behind the Dobbs Ferry High School, next to the Greenburgh Hebrew Center, and similar signs at Memorial Park in Irvington.

In Rockland County, two 16-year-olds were arrested in October on hate-crime charges, for racist and anti-Semitic graffiti, and an attempted cross burning on the lawn of a black family in Clarkstown that took place this past summer. And a Spring Valley trustee, Demeza Delhomme, drew fire when he made anti-Semitic comments on his weekly cable television show.

Jeremy M. Menchik, assistant director of the New York regional office of the Anti-Defamation League, said: ''There's been a spike in extremist activity in the last six months. You can see the trend - 10 incidents in Westchester, compared to seven last year - and we're not even at the end of the reporting period. We anticipate more incidents. It's a disturbing trend.''

According to local law enforcement officials and the district attorney's office, the leaflets -- mainly proclaiming Hitler's greatness - are protected as free speech under the First Amendment. The materials apparently came from the Web site of the New Order, a white supremacist organization with a post office box in Milwaukee. Two leaflets were distributed, one saying that ''Hitler was Right'' and the other exploring ''Who is Hitler?''

''Free speech is a fundamental right that the Supreme Court recognizes, '' said , Jeanine Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney. ''When free speech crosses the line into criminal behavior is where we could prosecute. Handing out literature, as outrageous and inappropriate and morally wrong and hateful as it is, is still not a crime. It's protected. Someone who would hand out literature to a young boy saying that Hitler was right was one of the most morally outrageous and bankrupt acts that deserves prosecution, but the First Amendment doesn't allow it. The hate crimes unit collects all of the information.''

Floyd Abrams, the prominent First Amendment lawyer, said: ''The district attorney is right that the speech is fully protected under the First Amendment as a sort of political advocacy. It would not be protected in almost any country other than ours, like Canada or France. We don't allow our government to suppress what is at its core political advocacy.''

The inability to pursue any charges against the distribution of the pro-Hitler literature frustrates people like Donna Cohen, executive director of the Westchester Holocaust Education Center in Purchase, which offers a free program for nonviolent juvenile offenders of hate crimes.

''So many survivors live in the community,'' Ms. Cohen said, referring to Westchester. ''No one's gotten hurt, but this is how it started in Germany. We've been very lucky in this community, but this is having little red flags going up. We have to pay attention. Hate is percolating out there. This is not a Jewish problem. It is a community problem.''

County Executive Andrew J. Spano in an e-mail message: ''There is no place in Westchester County -- or anywhere in this country -- for bigotry and hatred. The recent attempts to idolize Hitler are despicable and frightening. Fortunately, they have fallen on deaf ears, but not before causing worry and outrage. Our residents and our government must be ever vigilant in efforts to fight bigotry and prejudice wherever it raises its ugly head. ''

Among the specific actions the county is taking includes having the Department of Public Safety work with the Anti-Defamation League to monitor Web sites of groups known to be involved in bias activities and to develop a training program for police patrol officers and investigators on recognizing extremist groups.

Laura Lewis, a lawyer who is executive director of the Westchester chapter of the American Jewish Committee, in White Plains, said: ''For me, the issue is that these groups have a strong tendency to be violent. The ante keeps getting raised. The Jewish community here is one of the largest recipients of hate literature. I think it would behoove the anticrimes unit to try to find a common theme. It is free speech, but it is the tip of the iceberg. I am concerned with the general rise in the level of anti-Semitism around the world. When people feel threatened, they resort to old patterns, and resort to blaming the Jews.''

One problem is that ''there's a need for training in law enforcement in these kinds of incidents,'' said Mayo Bartlett, a lawyer with Young and Bartlett in White Plains who specializes in human rights and civil rights.

''Swastikas painted on a house speaks for itself,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''A lot of these organizations have violent histories. There's value in monitoring this type of literature. You could make the argument that there are parallels between these groups and terrorists, looking to change through coercion.''

Mr. Bartlett is also on the board of the Westchester Holocaust Education Center and been in charge of the bias crime unit of the district attorney's office until March of this year.

In Sleepy Hollow, where the swastikas were painted on a resident's door, Jimmy Warren, the police chief, said: ''There are no suspects yet, but it's an on-going investigation. We could bring a charge of vandalism as far as marking up someone's home. It could elevate itself to a hate crime. It depends on what was the person's intent when he committed the act, to mark up the home or to instill fear.''

To some Jews, the incidents are unsettling.

David Holtz, rabbi at Temple Beth Abraham in Tarrytown, said: ''I don't want to minimize this. The leaflet doesn't espouse violence. I think it is anti-Semitic, and that you don't just ignore it. It's critical that people not be quiet. That's what they did with Hitler at first.''",nytimes.com,True

A local activist, Al Peters, called Staten Island ''this twilight zone, this borough from another planet.''

Mr. Siegel compared the racial discord on Staten Island to past problems in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bensonhurst and Crown Heights, as well as in the South. ''If we have to begin a Northern civil rights movement, let's bring it on,'' he said.

''This could be an historic movement to bring about racial changes needed. You remember the Mississippi summer? We may need a New York summer with some Southerners coming up to help us out with our problem.'

Some speakers complained that while the island's minority population has grown, the percentages of minorities in the school system, police force and government have not.

Jeff McGraham, 30, a white man who lives in a predominantly black part of Stapleton, said he has often seen police officers mistreating young black men on the street.

The church is miles away from the site of the attack, in an exclusive part of Nassau County on the North Shore. Mr. Ramirez said many of the parishioners had given anonymously, with the other contributions coming from outside Long Island. He said he was struck by the outpouring of generosity.

The firebombing had thrust Farmingville into a familiar spotlight. In 2000, two Hispanic day laborers, who lived next door to the family, were led to a deserted area and severely beaten.

Newsday has reported that one of the five teenagers accused in the firebombing pleaded guilty on Thursday to fourth-degree arson as a hate crime. The youth, Derek Brandafino, 17, faces a maximum of seven years in prison in an agreement that requires him to testify against his friends if necessary, the article said. The others who have been accused are Kyle Mahler, 17, Scott Soucek, 16, William Lutz, 16, and a boy, 15, whose name has not been released.

''I don't feel any rancor toward them,'' Mr. Perez said in Spanish, ''because we don't know them.''

When they walked inside the pool hall, they found themselves outnumbered by a larger group of Asian boys, who chased them outside, an investigator said.

''They don't like calling the cops because they'll get in trouble,'' James said, citing a concern as old as the simultaneous existence of multiple generations.

But Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn, one of several black council members to criticize the department's handling of the events, said that the mayor was trying to protect the police, and in doing so, was sending the wrong message.

''The mayor is a white male of privilege in New York,'' Mr. Barron said. ''He doesn't have a clue as to what happens when black people go to law enforcement. They did not act appropriately. They should have immediately launched an investigation and labeled it as a bias crime. They brushed it off as a little incident between teenagers.''",nytimes.com,True

The student, Rachel Carter, 18, of South River, N.J., had gone to a barbecue at the home of a friend, Jarra Flanagan, who lives on Armstrong Avenue up the street from the park, Ms. Carter said yesterday. Late at night, Ms. Carter and five others -- three men and two women -- strolled down to the park, she said.

A group of white youths was hanging out there, and one of them used a racial slur that seemed to refer to her, she said. Ms. Carter said she told them not to use the word, they told her to mind her own business, and she and her friends sat down nearby. After about 20 minutes, Ms. Carter said, as her group prepared to leave, one of her friends got in a shouting match with someone in the other group.

The police said that one of the white youths pulled out a sickle and cut one of Ms. Carter's friends in the arm, while another white youth used a broken bottle to slash the arm of another of her friends, creating a wound that required 17 stitches. A third friend, Justin Moglia, said that he was badly beaten, and yesterday, a week after the incident, he still had two black eyes.

Ms. Carter said that a white girl punched her in the jaw. She identified the man cut with the bottle as Frank Sottile and the man cut with the knife as Jose Alvarado.

Carmela Botallico, 59, who lives next door to the park where the fight occurred, said yesterday that she had frequently complained to the police about the groups of young people who drink in the park late at night, but that the commotion that woke her up in the early hours of Sept. 1 was different. ''It sounded bad,'' she said. She called 911 and ''I told them to get over here before someone gets killed.''

What happened next is disputed. Ms. Botallico said that only one police car arrived on the scene. Mr. Moglia, 21, a student at Rutgers University, said that he and his friends pointed out some of the youths getting into a Nissan Altima but that the police did not seem interested in pursuing them as they drove off.

Ms. Carter, a student at Middlesex Community College, said that she and her friends received first aid at the scene from paramedics, but that the police told her ''there was nothing we could do'' about the attack itself.

Ms. Flanagan, the friend who lives near the park, said that an officer told her he could not fill out a report because she and her friends did not have the assailants' names, and that he advised her friends to go back to New Jersey in case the attackers returned. They did so, and were treated at a hospital in New Brunswick, she said.

Ms. Carter's mother, Joan, said that when she called the 122nd Precinct two days after the attack to ask about the investigation, she was told that no report had been made about the incident. She began calling radio stations and newspapers. At the end of the week, she said, her daughter went to the precinct and gave a statement to the police.

Commissioner Kelly said that the victims had refused medical attention at the scene and that the case was being investigated by the bias crimes unit. ''We are doing an investigation to see if our officers who responded acted appropriately,'' he said.

A second, apparently unrelated attack took place in the same precinct on Saturday. The police are investigating it as a possible bias incident. That evening, a black man and a Hispanic woman in a car got into a dispute with two white couples in the car behind them, the police said, adding that some of the occupants of the second car got out and damaged the couple's car.

Great Kills, a neighborhood of detached homes and tidy lawns, is 90 percent non-Hispanic white and less than one percent non-Hispanic black, according to 2000 census figures. Several residents said that they rarely if ever saw a black person in the neighborhood except on the commercial strip of Hylan Boulevard.

Others had different impressions. Joey Dagostaro, 30, who grew up in the neighborhood, said that in recent years he sometimes saw black and white teenagers hanging out together late at night in the park without incident.

They include women, the disabled, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans. For the first time since civil rights groups began commemorating the anniversary of the march, major conveners of today's march include the Arab American Institute and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

At the same time, the size and influence of the torch-bearing civil rights organizations behind the historic march has diminished, even as their rhetoric and tactics have been adopted by a host of new and disparate causes. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, now led by Martin Luther King III, son of the slain civil rights leader, is a mere shadow of its former self. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee is gone. Even the N.A.A.C.P nearly went bankrupt in the 1990's.

''It's a whole bevy of people who join what you could still call a movement, but it's something far broader -- less spontaneous maybe, but potentially more powerful,'' said Washington's delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, who helped organize the 1963 march.

More Voices, More Issues

Still, the resulting conglomeration is rife with contradictions and challenges. It is a movement that is more diverse, yet less integrated. It is desirous of new blood, yet often out of touch with younger people. It is embracing new political causes, yet fighting to maintain its political influence. And many of the issues on the current agenda are far more subtle and complex, less easy to package, than the right to register to vote without fear of injury or death.

A recent public service campaign, about housing discrimination by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, founded in 1951, highlights the movement's more expansive reach. The radio and television commercials feature a series of prospective renters with strong accents and names like Juan Hernandez, Sanjay Kumar and Tyrone Washington all trying to view an apartment and being turned down on the phone, while the caller who ''sounds white'' is given an appointment.

''It's necessarily become much more inclusive,'' Karen Narasaki, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, said. ''There are many more voices. But there are also more issues.''

In 1963 no one considered issues like the racial profiling of Arab-Americans, hate crime legislation for gays and lesbians, or welfare for illegal immigrants.

The broadening of the mandate has not come without tension. ''There are some who fear that investing resources in the examination of issues faced by other communities dilutes attention from issues still faced by African-Americans,'' Ms. Narasaki said.

The movement is also facing a public that is increasingly cool to many of its goals, like affirmative action. In a Gallup poll taken in June, 17 percent of black respondents said they believed that blacks have job opportunities equal to whites. In contrast, 55 percent of whites said they thought blacks and whites had equal chances for employment.

''For many white people, the laws that were passed in the 1960's took care of everything,'' said Julian Bond, chairman of the N.A.A.C.P. ''For them, they just shrug their shoulders and say, 'What's the problem? I don't get it.' ''

Even the vocabulary of 40 years ago at times falls short of capturing the complexity of the issues championed today. For instance, said Randall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard Law School, a literal interpretation of the word ''discrimination'' can obscure the disadvantage brought about by historic inequality. The word ''racism'' does not capture detrimental attitudes or positions that are based on race or are racist.

''We need new lingo,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''Maybe what groups are fighting against today is subordination. Wielding the old words often lets people off the hook. It doesn't zero in on what is truly culpable in certain conduct.''

An Economic Agend

Some of the seeds of the current struggle for a broadly encompassing but focused message took root around the planning for the 1963 march. Organizers of the 40th-anniversary march promoted it as a march for jobs and freedom.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

When they think of the 1963 march, many people today only remember Martin Luther King Jr.'s ''I Have a Dream'' speech and the calls for racial equality. In fact, access to jobs and eradication of poverty were the initial objectives of the rally. A. Philip Randolph, the influential president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, who called for the march, and Bayard Rustin, who organized it, originally conceived of it as a way to do something about the grinding poverty that afflicted not only blacks, but other groups as well.

''This civil rights demonstration is not confined to the Negro; nor is it confined to civil rights; for our white allies know that they cannot be free while we are not,'' Randolph said in his speech on the National Mall on the day of the march. ''We know that we have no future in which six million black and white people are unemployed, and millions more live in poverty.''

But the burning racial strife in the South in the early 1960's focused much of the attention during the march and in the years following on the call to end Jim Crow laws.

In the next five years the primary legal goals of the movement were met with the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. But 40 years later, the liberal economic agenda championed by Randolph, Rustin and King remains stalled in the eyes of many.

In many ways the march and the years directly after were the apex for traditional civil rights groups. Later in the 1960's and 70's, white liberals gravitated toward new moral crusades like opposing the Vietnam War, fighting for women's rights and protecting the environment. Black nationalists eschewed the nonviolent strategies of the old-line civil rights organizations.

The economic stagnation of the 70's and 80's made middle- and working-class whites less supportive of programs to help poor blacks and resentful of efforts like affirmative action that primarily helped middle-class blacks.

''It is one thing to be liberal minded about issues of equality in the 1960's, when the people you're talking about are clearly a subordinate class,'' said Ron Walters, a political science professor at the University of Maryland. ''It is altogether different when the fruits of those efforts usher in a black middle class engaged in social competition for goods.''

If the ranks of traditional black civil rights organizations have diminished over the years, it is largely as an outgrowth of their own success. Black intellectuals planned and organized the movements of the 60's. Today they cluster in a slew of black professional organizations, such as those for lawyers, doctors, engineers and journalists, which have sprung up with increasing educational and job possibilities. Others who would lend valuable strategic, financial and marketing skills to the movement are often siphoned off by the much better-paying private sector.

Gaining the right to vote turned the energy of many black people away from the civil rights protests and towards the political arena. In 1970, seven years after the March on Washington, there were 1,469 black elected officials in the United States, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which studies black-oriented issues. By the year 2000, the number had reached more than 9,000. Some say there are still mass demonstrations of black people seeking to secure rights and advantages. They are now called elections.

''And those are the best kinds of demonstrations to have,'' Ms. Norton said.

'We Just Acted'

Some veteran civil rights advocates bemoan the lack of involvement in older organizations and causes as apathy born of privilege. ''In 1963 we didn't have Web sites, cellular phones or fax machines,'' said Representative John Lewis of Georgia, 63, who as chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was the youngest speaker at the march 40 years ago. ''We just acted.''

Many who came of age after the pivotal years of the movement argue that a change of focus and tactics is only natural. ''Success today in motivating people is not necessarily defined by getting 100,000 people out to a march,'' said Nelson George, 45, an author, film producer and pop culture critic. ''For some people it may be about 100,000 hits on a Web site. And that's O.K.''

For all the talk of new rhetoric and new strategies, some scholars of the movement say its future lies with people who know little of its origins.

Rogers M. Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of ''The Unsteady March: The Rise and Decline of Racial Inequality,'' said the movement's future would depend largely on how closely new immigrants identify with the goals of the civil rights struggle and how readily the movement embraces them.

''All we need to do, really, is agree to a set of principles and stick to them,'' Mr. Yzaguirre said. ''If a program is for the poor, then it should focus on all poor people. If we're going to have a diversity program, then it should be truly diverse. We can't accept a system anymore where any member is a junior partner.''",nytimes.com,True

Too tired to cook, they had stopped at the Jackson Heights Indian Market for take-out chicken curry and were walking toward their apartment at 59th Street and 47th Avenue when the three men, who had been sitting in a livery cab, began taunting one of the men, who was wearing a Sikh turban, calling him ''bin Laden,'' his wife said. She asked that she and her husband not be identified for fear of retaliation.

The victims said they told the men, ''Relax, relax,'' and explained that they were Indian immigrants from Punjab with no connections to Osama bin Laden or to the Taliban who sheltered him in Afghanistan.

The woman, sensing a fight was imminent, told her 10-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter to run into the apartment and call for help.

But the attackers started cursing the victims, spat on them, and grabbed Mr. Gill by the neck, putting him in a headlock, he and the woman said. Then, the attackers pushed and punched the victims, continuing to curse them as the woman implored them to go away, the victims said.

The three attackers ran off before the police arrived, the victims said.

Yesterday afternoon, the woman and Mr. Gill were recuperating at home while the other victim, a taxi driver, was at work. All three declined to go to a hospital for treatment.

Mr. Gill, who also drives a cab, said no one in Woodside had ever bothered or harmed them before.

''It's the first time it's happened in my life,'' said the woman, a special education teacher. ''It's very insulting. We live in America. We are American citizens.''

Though Woodside was once almost exclusively Irish, Mr. Gill said his neighbors are from many nationalities, including Greek, Colombian, Chinese, Arabic and Spanish.

For the victims, the attack conjured memories of the Sikhs and Muslims who were targeted after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Gill and the woman recalled how some men shaved their beards and doffed their turbans to avoid reprisals.

Re ''Bias-Crime Claim Puzzles Beach Enclave in Queens'' (news article, July 29):

The residents of Breezy Point who insist that no hate crime could occur in their neighborhood because they want to avoid a bad reputation are creating just the opposite effect.

A single hate crime could occur in any neighborhood at any time. A neighborhood won't be judged by a single crime, but by how it reacts to that crime. Denial is not a way to deal with bias. One must acknowledge bias and confront it, not turn a blind eye to it.

Three years ago, tensions increased when two men posing as employers lured two Mexicans from their home in Farmingville to an abandoned warehouse in nearby Shirley and attacked them with digging tools. The attackers were sentenced to 25 years in prison, and the conflict over the laborers' presence in town seemed to quiet down.

The recent case of arson at the home of Maria Garcia, Sergio Perez and their two children, a simple wood-frame house at 45 Granny Road, made neighbors wonder whether the conflict had resumed. In fact, the house was next door to the home of the two Mexicans who were beaten three years ago.

But the two men convicted in the earlier incident were covered with racist and neo-Nazi tattoos, and the police said the young men charged in the fire did not appear to belong to any hate group and were not tattooed. In fact, they did not seem to know the Mexican family, the authorities said.

Sleeping in the house were a couple with their two young children. Two other adults also lived in the house. ''Why would anyone do this to us?'' the family has asked. ''We have no enemies,'' they told me. Now they find themselves homeless.

I am sad to say that I was not surprised that this incident occurred. It came soon after Chris Simcox, who is known to pack a pistol and to advocate establishing militias to ''protect'' neighborhoods from immigrants, appeared at the invitation of the Sachem Quality of Life Organization, a local anti-immigrant group, to speak to its annual conference. On any Saturday morning, you can witness members of the Sachem group taunting day laborers waiting for work on street corners.

Most of the longtime residents of Farmingville are good, decent, hard-working and honest people. They have the same dreams and aspirations for their families as the more recently arrived immigrants who work as day laborers. Unfortunately, there is a very small but vocal and militant group that has stirred anti-immigrant feelings and appeals to the worst instincts in those who feel threatened by newcomers into a community. As a result, this community, along with Suffolk County and Long Island as a whole, has become associated and identified nationally as a racially intolerant place. This is not a positive way to promote our region as a place to work and live.

Bill Cunningham, a candidate for Suffolk county executive, appears to be the only voice displaying leadership and political will by proposing a hiring hall that would give the day laborers their own place to assemble. Let's listen to such voices of reason before there is another tragic bias attack. Businesses and industry, along with young professional families, will avoid considering our area as a possible place to build a future. We cannot afford to continue to ignore the issue of day laborers and must begin to address it yesterday.

The Suffolk Police Department is showing aggressive leadership in its investigation of this incident. The Bias Crimes Bureau is participating in the investigation and using all the resources available to find those who perpetrated this crime against innocent people. Let us hope that government officials follow the Suffolk police and provide the leadership they were elected to give. It is a mystery why no public officials are willing to step forward and lead on this issue. Where are the county executive and the legislators? Had this incident occurred to a member of another ethnic group, I daresay that politicians would be lining up behind microphones to condemn this attack. Why not now? Why the silence? If there ever was a time when leadership was needed, it is now.

https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/18/world/south-africa-panel-reverses-its-ruling-on-hate-speech.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"The South African Human Rights Commission ruled today that a slogan chanted at the funeral of an antiapartheid leader last year, ''Kill the Boer, kill the farmer,'' is hate speech and is not constitutionally protected.

The ruling reversed a previous finding that the slogan, while reprehensible, was protected speech under the country's post-apartheid Constitution.

Commissioner Karthy Govender told reporters today the commission had concluded that ''the calling for the killing of a group of people is an advocacy of hatred, which must amount to harm.''

The Freedom Front, an Afrikaner separatist group, brought the complaint last year after marchers chanted the slogan at a meeting of the Youth League of the governing African National Congress and at the funeral of Peter Mokaba, a militant A.N.C. member of Parliament.

Television pictures of the funeral that showed marchers shouting, ''Kill the Boer, kill the farmer,'' caused an uproar last June. A.N.C. officials at the event quickly put a stop to the chanting and party leaders have disavowed the slogan.

The couple said they appreciated the support of neighbors in Farmingville, a hamlet in central Suffolk County. The two day laborers beaten in September 2000, Israel Perez Arvizu and Magdaleno Estrada Escamilla, lived next door to 45 Granny Road, where Mr. Perez and Ms. Garcia lived. Mr. Perez said he knew the two men by sight.

Today, Mr. Ramirez read from several notes sent by residents from the neighborhood and beyond.

''I am ashamed to think that such hatred lives in my community,'' wrote one neighbor, who enclosed a check for $300.

The couple spoke briefly about the fire. On July 4, Mr. Perez said, they had spent the day shopping and cleaning around the house. They went to bed at 10 p.m., and were awakened in the early morning by the shouts of neighbors trying to rouse them after seeing the flames. A witness told the police of seeing someone throw a flaming object from a black vehicle.

Re ''Old Tensions Over Immigrants Surface After Firebombing'' (news article, July 14):

Can any reasonable person suspect that the firebombing of the Hispanic home in Farmingville, on Long Island, is anything but a hate crime?

It is ludicrous that the police and the F.B.I. are only now suggesting that it might be a bias crime.

When will Suffolk County wake up to the need for a hiring site for day laborers? Where hiring sites exist in other communities, the incidence of violence diminishes.

Robert J. Gaffney, the county executive, missed a real opportunity to reduce tensions by constructing a site after the attempted murders of two Hispanics in September 2000. One hopes that local officials will act now, before someone is killed.

EDWARD J. THOMPSON

Farmingdale, N.Y., July 14, 2003",nytimes.com,True
https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/14/nyregion/old-tensions-over-immigrants-surface-after-firebombing.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Around 1 a.m. on July 5, the police said, a neighbor saw someone in a black vehicle throw a flaming object through the window at 45 Granny Road. Neighbors still celebrating the Fourth of July heard shattering glass, saw the flames, and helped rescue the four adults and two young children inside. Now, the Suffolk County Police Department, the F.B.I. and the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York are investigating whether it was a bias crime.

But even without answers as to who did it and why, the fire has sounded an eerie echo of what happened on Sept. 17, 2000, when Israel Perez Arvizu and Magdaleno Estrada Escamilla, who lived in the house next door, were lured to an abandoned building in nearby Shirley with the promise of work, then attacked with digging tools. The two assailants, Ryan D. Wagner and Christopher Slavin, were each sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Since then, some pieces of the puzzle have shifted. Workers and their advocates say it is no longer common these days, as it was three years ago, to have empty bottles hurled at Hispanic men on the street. The Workplace Project has been trying to help the laborers organize themselves under the umbrella of the United Day Laborers.

Gaudencio García and Salvador Escamilla, members of that group, said their organization has put out about a dozen newsletters. In interviews translated by Ms. Marin-Molina, the men said the group's members have met with police officials and written newsletter articles explaining housing and driving laws.

''People are beginning to realize that we're not alone, and that we can bind together in a group,'' Mr. García said. Still, he said, the firebombing had a chilling effect.

''It's a renewed threat,'' he said. ''We had felt tranquillity.''

There have also been shifts in the Sachem Quality of Life, a local group that opposes illegal immigration and which, while it was not connected to the attack nearly three years ago, was criticized by some public officials and immigrants' advocates for contributing to the charged climate in which it took place. A few years ago, workers say, more than a dozen members of the group would gather by the local 7-Eleven on Saturdays, holding signs with slogans like ''Deport Illegal Aliens.'' Now, the number has dwindled to no more than five, and in general, their presence in the hamlet has diminished.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Recently, however, the Sachem group has split, alarming some critics. Its longtime spokesman, Ray Wysolmierski, who still answers to that title, said members of the breakaway group ''want to be a little bit more radical in their approach.''

Members of the new group did not return telephone calls seeking comment. About a month and a half ago, they held a conference featuring Chris Simcox, founder of a volunteer armed watch group that intercepts illegal immigrants crossing into Arizona and turns them over to the authorities.

And the basic ingredients that proved combustible a few years ago, for the most part, have remained.

The Suffolk County Legislature considered, but ultimately rejected, several proposals to limit the presence of day laborers. One would have had the county file a federal suit to force the Immigration and Naturalization Service, now the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, to move against the immigrants. Another would have revoked the licenses of contractors hiring undocumented workers.

Other Suffolk legislators proposed spending county money for a hiring hall where workers and employers could meet in an organized fashion, but Robert J. Gaffney, the Suffolk County executive, vetoed the measure.

Now, as three years ago, there is a shortage of cheap housing, so the men still crowd into single-family houses. There is no hiring hall, although Mr. Gaffney said in a telephone interview that he thought more and more men were being picked up at home by their employers. Immigration authorities have not raided the community. And while the economy may have been in a slump, Long Island still has a fertile market for people willing to mow lawns, paint houses, lay bricks and the like.

Detective Sgt. Robert Reecks, commander of the bias crimes unit of the Suffolk police, said virtually no bias crimes against immigrant workers have been reported in Farmingdale since the 2000 attacks in Shirley. But he said he thought day laborers were still reluctant to report crimes, saying, ''They're still very much in fear of the Police Department.''

For some residents, the issue is still raw. ''This is a political problem here, and nobody seems to want to come in,'' said Frank Hardina, a Farmingville retiree.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. Hardina said that the issue of day laborers has not been in the news, but has been on his mind. His car and house have been pelted with eggs, he said, and his television cable cut. He has no proof, but he suspects the laborers.

His neighbors Joseph and Deborah Mudaro said that until the firebombing, they had thought things had been settling down. Now, they wonder.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

''A lot of people have turned the other cheek and just accepted what's going on,'' Mr. Mudaro said. ''You had promises that people were going to do something for a while, then it all faded away. Now it looks like it's coming to a boiling point again.''

But the Rev. John M. Derasmo, pastor of the Roman Catholic Church of the Resurrection, opposite the firebombed home, was not so sure. Things are not the same, he said, as they were when he arrived at the parish five years ago. The handful of parishioners who barraged him with complaints that the parish was doing too much to welcome undocumented workers no longer attend Mass there.

Other, milder gripes about the workers' presence in the community, if not the church, virtually stopped after the terror attacks of Sept. 11. At recent trilingual Masses, featuring prayers in English, Portuguese and Spanish, he said, ''the church was packed.''

''I don't know if it's so much that they changed their views about the laborers, but they focused their attention on something else,'' Father Derasmo said. ''I think there are people in the community who are concerned, but I think they're willing to see how we can live in peace with one another.''",nytimes.com,True

Just as important as talking about hate crimes, New York City was acting to monitor and prevent them. The police department added a category to the CompStat crime-tracking system that accounted for bias directed at Arab-Americans. Every day the police commissioner, Bernard Kerik, would brief me on when and where such incidents were occurring and what the police were doing to combat them.

My country has struggled with its own history of prejudice and intolerance, with racism being particularly pernicious. The United States has taken several concrete steps to address these failings. Europe must now take the same approach. Tomorrow I will recommend that all 55 members of the O.S.C.E. adopt three important measures against hate crime.

First, they should agree to track hate crimes and recognize them as distinct from other acts of murder, assault or vandalism. The best way to predict and prevent crime is to assess the forces behind it accurately. For example, if several synagogues are vandalized in a short period, it is not only ineffective but intellectually dishonest to post additional police officers near all houses of worship, as if to pretend that one's nation does not have a special problem with anti-Semitism.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

There is precedent for collecting such data nationally. The Hate Crimes Statistics Act, passed by Congress in 1990, requires the federal government to acquire data on crimes that ''manifest prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.'' This information is an invaluable tool to police officials. It also holds them, and our elected officials, accountable for increases in hate crimes within their jurisdictions.

Second, just as important as collecting this information is making sure that it is not allowed to languish in some desk drawer. There must be analysis of and reaction to crime data on a regular basis. Critical to the success of New York City's CompStat program were weekly accountability meetings in which police officials would plan officer deployments, share successful strategies, praise good work and constructively criticize areas found to have fallen short of established goals.

Likewise, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe should establish its own meetings, at least annually, at which members can compare their results to stated goals and develop effective strategies for enforcement and education. It is promising that in October, the member states will meet again in Warsaw to review their progress on the recommendations that will come from this week's meeting. Such ''accountability sessions'' should become a permanent part of the organization's meetings.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Last, the Europeans should pass hate crimes legislation to stiffen penalties for offenses in recognition of the special threat they represent to a society's stability. Yes, some will argue that hate crimes need not be punished more harshly than similar crimes committed for different reasons. But the fact is that extra penalties are used throughout civilized legal systems -- in Europe as well as America -- as a way to distinguish acts that are particularly heinous. One of the functions of the law is to teach, to draw lines between what's permissible and what's forbidden. Recognizing the special threat that hate crimes pose to a democracy sends a powerful message that these acts will not be tolerated.

These specific measures will be effective, of course, only if the O.S.C.E. countries make broader efforts to address the roots of anti-Semitism. Making sure their citizens have an honest understanding of the Holocaust is vital, as revisionist viewpoints put us at risk of a repetition of race-based genocide. Schools must look at how they educate children regarding tolerance and fairness. Universities, public officials, advertisers and the news media should publicize the tremendous contributions that Jews have made to European societies through the years.

Finally, Europe must address the climate that has allowed anti-Semitism to return with such force. Hate flourishes when excuses for the conduct are accepted, or justified by vague connections to international politics. If a synagogue is torched, the response must not be, ''The act is wrong, but we can understand the reasons the arsonist feels he must resort to such extreme measures.'' The perpetrators must not be allowed to advance their so-called cause through violence.

Despite the alarming rise in anti-Semitic violence throughout Europe, there are strong Jewish communities all over the continent. European governments are working to regenerate the communities that played an integral role in the fabric of nations for hundreds of years. Seventy years after the Holocaust, more Jews are settling in Germany than in any other country (including Israel), increasing that country's Jewish population from 33,000 in 1990 to about 200,000 today.

The screenplay glides quickly past the gathering of evidence; the killers left a number of clues that made the case easy to crack. In a compact, chilling interrogation scene, the sheriff and the district attorney force the pickup truck's owner, a soggy marshmallow of a man named Shawn Allen Berry (Toby Proctor), to confess to his role in the crime, getting crucial testimony that leads to the death-penalty convictions of the other two killers.

Meanwhile, an armed phalanx of Black Panthers turns up to protest the murder, and by the time the Klan mounts its own rally outside the courthouse, tempers start to crack. Before long, a task force appointed by the mayor presents the sheriff with a long list of grievances. As Mayor Horn grimly says: ''We've been pretending all these years. It's all make-believe.''

What gives these scenes of social unraveling their punch is the sense that the townspeople are deeply animated by their religion, and that despite all the talk of the need for faith and healing they are being unfairly squeezed between demagogues on both sides while the politicians and the news media fan the flames.

The film, whose gospel-flavored music is by turns mournful and portentous, has some mawkish moments and hokey dialogue. But it gamely tackles knotty issues of race and identity, suggesting that everyone, no matter how devout and well-meaning, carries some kind of racial baggage that surfaces under the right set of pressures.

Sheriff Rowles, for one, comes off as a decent guy who surprises himself by acknowledging that he's against racially mixed marriages (''It's real hard on mixed-race kids'') and suggests that maybe the reason that police stop more blacks in Jasper is that they commit more crimes than whites. For his part, Mayor Horn, stirring up a long-repressed memory of a relative's savage beating by white police officers, grows angrier and more strident as the trial progresses.

In fact, the increasingly brittle relationship between the mayor and sheriff is the best thing about ''Jasper, Texas.'' Mr. Voight, who has chomped his share of scenery over the years, turns in a nicely shaded performance, making Mr. Gossett the far more animated actor. It's a treat to watch these two warhorses play off each other, lending nuance to a friendship tested by dimly understood prejudices.

Fittingly, the film closes on an uncertain note after the conviction and sentencing of the first defendant.

We're left with the sense that even if nothing will ever be the same in Jasper, ''leastways,'' as Mr. Gossett's character says, ''we ain't pretending no more.''

Burials in a Scrap Hill, A Cemetery in Red Ink

In 2000, a very troubled Cypress Hills Cemetery, on the Brooklyn-Queens border, filed a bankruptcy petition that its lawyers said was needed to pre-empt lawsuits that could have resulted in damages far exceeding its assets.

Those suing included families of many of the more than 1,000 people who had been buried on a disintegrating, 50-foot-high hill. After the burials, the families learned that the hill had been created from rubble trucked in from construction and demolition sites. The families sought a total of more than $10 million in damages.

Now, a proposal for the cemetery's reorganization under the bankruptcy laws has been negotiated and is awaiting a response from those who have claims against the cemetery. It calls for about $2.5 million to be paid to satisfy, fully or partly, the debts to various creditors, like the employees' pension fund. But the nearly 200 families whose suit was cut short would get nothing.

A lawyer for the cemetery, Gilbert A. Lazarus, said that the families' claims had been satisfied by an offer for reburial without charge elsewhere in the cemetery, and that many families of people buried on the hill had accepted it.

''The government didn't give us that,'' she added.

At the trial, a medical examiner for the city, Joaquin Gutierrez, testified that Mr. Rosenbaum's four stab wounds were not disabling, although he also said that two of the wounds ''could potentially have caused death.''

Mr. Rosenbaum was alert and conscious when he was taken from the scene in 1991, and he identified Mr. Nelson as his attacker. He died hours later at Kings County Hospital.

As yesterday's verdict was announced, Mr. Nelson, 27, was stone-faced upon hearing the word ''guilty,'' but after the second part was announced and his lawyer whispered in his ear, apparently to explain its significance, he heaved a sigh of relief and smiled broadly. He was not allowed to speak with his family, but he hugged his defense team's paralegal assistant, Jennie Carmona, with such fervor that one of her blouse buttons came undone.

In opening statements, Mr. Nelson's lawyer, Richard M. Jasper, made a dramatic turnaround from the previous trials by conceding that his client had stabbed Mr. Rosenbaum, but said he had done so because he had been drinking and was ''caught up in the excitement,'' not because of Mr. Rosenbaum's religion. Prosecutors called this explanation implausible, noting that Mr. Nelson had told a detective he heard a man yell, ''Let's get the Jew!'' before the crowd descended on Mr. Rosenbaum.

At a news conference outside the courthouse yesterday, the United States attorney for the eastern district, Roslynn R. Mauskopf, tried to put the verdict in a positive light. She said, just as Mr. Nelson's mother did, ''Justice has been served.'' As she said that, several in the small crowd of Orthodox Jews that had gathered shook their heads in disgust.

''They got him off,'' said one of them, Daniel Wasserman, 17, a high school student who lives in Crown Heights and attended the entire trial. ''He should stay in jail for life.''

Upon questioning, Ms. Mauskopf allowed that she was disappointed that the jury had not found Mr. Nelson responsible for Mr. Rosenbaum's death.

In 1992, Mr. Nelson was acquitted on a murder charge in Mr. Rosenbaum's death. Under pressure from civic and Jewish leaders, the Justice Department then took up the case, as it often does in racially tinged cases, and Mr. Nelson was convicted in 1997 of violating Mr. Rosenbaum's civil rights by attacking him because he was Jewish and because he was using the public streets. That conviction was overturned last year after an appeals court concluded that the trial judge had picked the jury improperly, setting the stage for the retrial in United States District Court.

The jury in the case was made up of eight blacks, two whites and two immigrants from Guyana. There were no Jews. The 1997 jury that convicted Mr. Nelson had three blacks, two Jews, three gentile whites and four Hispanics.

During six days of deliberations, the jury said it was deeply divided, telling the judge, Frederic Block, three times that it was at an impasse. ''We had our moments,'' Ms. McCloud said.

Although the State Health Department had found that Mr. Rosenbaum died as a result of inadequate treatment at the hospital, Mr. Nelson's lawyers were not allowed to mention that to the jury. Judge Block ruled that the fact that Mr. Rosenbaum would not have died had he not been stabbed made the hospital's actions legally irrelevant.

After yesterday's verdict, Mr. Rosenbaum, the victim's brother and a former prosecutor in Australia, saved his harshest words for the Justice Department officials in Washington who had declined to appeal the ruling overturning Mr. Nelson's 1997 conviction to the United States Supreme Court.

Fairly or unfairly, the Crown Heights violence became a symbol of leadership inattentiveness and a metaphor for a city that seemed out of control.

Years ago, New Yorkers made up their minds about what happened in Crown Heights, unencumbered by the details that are the bread and butter of the legal system. Someone shouted, ''Get the Jew.'' Mr. Nelson, then 16, stabbed Mr. Rosenbaum. So when his lawyers admitted the stabbing during this trial, even though they denied that it was because his victim was a Jew, they were confirming much of the shorthand understanding of the events.

The sweeping conclusions of some in the public realm were as extreme as they were unambiguous. ''I have been called a murderer. A Jew hater,'' Mr. Dinkins said in palpable bitterness during an interview while the latest Crown Heights jury deliberated. Though the point has often been debated, one strand of conventional wisdom has it that the violence in Crown Heights that August helped make Mr. Dinkins a one-term mayor.

According to an old adage, a trial is a search for truth. But it is a truth threaded through lawyers' strategies and spun around court rules. It is an imperfect truth settled, sometimes, by irritated jurors who are sick of being locked in a room together.

While the jurors in Mr. Nelson's case battled, the judge, Frederic Block, seemed to suggest that their lurching deliberations might not end up in a verdict that was a model of clarity. He said the jurors seemed ''muddled, confused and a little bit out of touch.''

Last night, James A. Cohen, a professor of criminal law at Fordham University School of Law, said the verdict did not help settle the historical record.

Facing the civil rights charge in the trial that ended yesterday, Mr. Nelson's defense lawyers challenged a public perception of one of the pivotal Crown Heights events. They argued that Mr. Nelson stabbed Mr. Rosenbaum not because of who he was but because Mr. Nelson was excited and drinking a 40-ounce beer.

''Whatever horrible, senseless, inexcusable thing Lemrick Nelson did to Yankel Rosenbaum, whatever crime he committed that night, it wasn't this crime,'' of a civil rights violation, argued one of the defense lawyers, Peter Quijano.

Some saw the defense as cunning. Some saw it as cynical. Some found it offensive. But the tactic may have worked well enough to create skepticism of the prosecution's case among some jurors. In their decision that the stabbing did not directly cause Mr. Nelson's death, they appeared to rely on little more than an allusion during the trial to old indications that Mr. Rosenbaum would have lived, but for botched medical care.

Creating such skepticism is an advocate's job. Lawyers serve a master different from the historical record, said Richard Emery, a civil rights lawyer who had no role in Mr. Nelson's trial. They transform shards of evidence into arguments. Sometimes, that means that the reality inside the courthouse appears different from the reality outside.

''Truth and history,'' Mr. Emery said, ''are the inevitable victims of an adversary system and the adversary system is a necessary requirement of a constitutional system that requires the government to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.''

One of Mr. Nelson's lawyers, James E. Neuman, took issue during an interview with the cliché's simplistic notion that trials are centered on finding the truth. ''A trial,'' he said, ''is not just about the truth; it is about a balancing of a lot of different issues and providing a defendant with protection against the government.''

So in the Brooklyn federal court, lawyers for the man who had helped spark a storm claimed his act was nothing more than a meaningless consequence of teenage drunkenness, while up at Columbia University, where he is a professor, Mr. Dinkins was nursing old wounds. ''Notwithstanding what I think is a superb record of support for Jewish people and the State of Israel,'' he said, ''all that was swept aside and I was accused in the most awful fashion.''

It is too soon to know whether there will be some ultimate historical assessment of Crown Heights, perhaps one that melds together the verdicts of the legal and political systems.

But, in a sense, August 1991 is already history. Richard E. Green, who runs the Crown Heights Youth Collective, just as he did that hot summer, said that for the teenagers in the neighborhood now, Mr. Rosenbaum, Mr. Nelson and Mr. Dinkins were all figures from a distant time.

Indeed, the themes of harmony and segregation echoed again and again in interviews with a few dozen residents and community leaders in the days leading to the conviction of Lemrick Nelson Jr. yesterday on federal civil rights charges in the stabbing death of Yankel Rosenbaum, an Orthodox Jew.

''You get the sense that they are more trying to get together with the colored people,'' said Neville Sandiford, 86, an immigrant from the West Indies who was sitting on a recent afternoon on his stoop near the corner of President Street and New York Avenue. ''They bow their heads, and tell you, 'Good morning.' ''

But like other blacks in the neighborhood, he sounded a subtle alarm that more Jews were moving in. ''You didn't have so much of them when I first came to this neighborhood,'' said Mr. Sandiford, a Crown Heights resident since 1956. ''The colored people don't stand a chance, because when they come and want to buy a house, they have to wait for the bank to approve them. But these Jews come with a suitcase full of money.''

Several residents pointed out that more people of different backgrounds were moving in, attracted to the area's abundant public transportation, reputation for safety and leafy streets, some lined with mansions. More Chinese, Koreans, Indians and Hispanics have begun moving to the area, residents said.

In the wake of the verdict, attitudes seemed very much unchanged, with several blacks criticizing the fact that no one had been brought to trial for killing Gavin Cato, the 7-year-old black boy who was struck by a car driven by a Jewish driver, and several Jews expressing dissatisfaction that Mr. Nelson, who is black, had not been convicted earlier.

Mr. Nelson, who was acquitted of murder in a trial in state court in 1992, conceded in the current trial that he did stab Mr. Rosenbaum, but said through his lawyers that he did it because he was drunk and overexcited and not because of Mr. Rosenbaum's religion or use of the streets.

As Judge Block told the jurors last week and again yesterday, if they do not find that Mr. Nelson violated Mr. Rosenbaum's civil rights, they can still return a guilty verdict if they determine that he helped someone else violate those rights.

Mr. Nelson's lawyers said the jury had every right to be confused. The defense team fought to keep the ''aiding and abetting'' option out of the jury instructions, in part because it gave the jury more leeway to convict, but in part because, they said, it made no sense.

In order to aid or abet in the violation of Mr. Rosenbaum's civil rights, Mr. Nelson would have had to ''willfully and knowingly associate himself'' with the violation. But, asked James Neuman, one of Mr. Nelson's lawyers, if the jury found that Mr. Nelson did not attack Mr. Rosenbaum with the intent of violating his rights, how could it find that he understood that someone else intended to violate them?

Mr. Rosenbaum's brother, Norman Rosenbaum, who has attended every day of every trial connected with the killing, said that he, too, was perplexed by the jury's questions but that he was not going to concern himself too much. ''They can ask as many questions as they want,'' he said. ''They can take as long as they want, as long as they convict him.''

As the deliberations continued, the courtroom and the hallway outside took on the appearance of a waiting room, or perhaps more accurately a waiting suite. In the hall, reporters played computer chess. At the back of the courtroom, a guard did a crossword puzzle. At the front, Mr. Nelson's mother, Valerie Evans, read from the book of Psalms. A columnist for The New York Post used a phone booth as a smoking lounge.

It occurred at 6:40 a.m., hours before celebrations at the temple day school to commemorate the 55th anniversary of the State of Israel.

Shargel, a defense lawyer, said that in theory, admitting to the killing could be a good trial strategy. ''If a jury understands that this extra element'' -- the requirement that the prosecution prove religious animus -- ''is part of the case, it forces the jury to come to terms with it,'' he said.

In other words, admitting to the killing could make it clear to a jury that Mr. Nelson is not being retried for murder.

The strategy may also stop the prosecution from dwelling on evidence that is now uncontested. ''It limits the powerful evidence that is likely to stir up a jury, that gets them in a surly mood,'' said Yale Kamisar, a law professor at the University of San Diego.

Jamie Orenstein, a former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn not involved in the first federal trial, questioned the strategy. ''It's always risky to admit the act and contest intent,'' he said. ''There is a good chance that the contradictory opening statement from the last trial can be admitted in evidence, which would be devastating in that it would show the jury that Nelson is playing games with the justice system.''

But a defendant can also be hurt by contesting the undeniable, and the evidence that Mr. Nelson killed Mr. Rosenbaum is, according to an appeals court decision, strong. There is DNA evidence, and Mr. Nelson made damaging admissions to a police detective.

Evidence of religious animus is weaker. Even after telling a detective that he stabbed Mr. Rosenbaum, Mr. Nelson continued to deny that religion had anything to do with it. This was long before he could have understood the legal significance of the point.

''No, I was just high from the beer,'' he said, according to the appeals court decision. ''I just got caught up in the excitement.''

The admission of murder puts him at little legal risk. Mr. Nelson did not testify at his earlier trials, so he cannot be prosecuted for perjury. And while the new admission might subject him to liability for damages in a civil lawsuit, he probably has no money. Nor can he be retried in state court for murder, because of the double jeopardy clause.

In one way, then, he is using the clause as a shield. But in another way, exceptions to double jeopardy have put him at risk, forcing the defense to craft this new strategy.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Supreme Court has read two kinds of exceptions into the double jeopardy clause: reprosecutions on different charges are allowed in general, and the federal government, because it is viewed as a separate authority, is free to retry state cases on the same charges, provided a federal statute applies. That second exception is known as the dual sovereignty doctrine.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the Nelson case, it is not clear whether a more direct federal homicide charge might have applied, but in general, the Justice Department has chosen to rely on civil rights charges in reprosecutions.

Dual sovereignty is established law, but it remains controversial. When the federal appeals court reversed Mr. Nelson's 1997 conviction, it held that the case presented no double jeopardy problem, noting that it was bound by Supreme Court precedent. But Judge Guido Calabresi, who wrote the decision, had elsewhere questioned such reprosecutions.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

''There can be no doubt,'' Judge Calabresi wrote in an unrelated 1995 decision, that the cases of Mr. Nelson and the officers accused of beating Rodney King ''involved reprosecutions in emotionally and politically charged contexts. It was to avoid political pressures for reprosecution that the double jeopardy clause was adopted.'' He expressed, he said, ''no opinion whatsoever'' about the cases themselves or how the double jeopardy clause might apply to them.

The Justice Department's internal policy is to bar reprosecutions in all but the most compelling cases. And some legal experts said Mr. Nelson's recent admission now helps justify Attorney General Janet Reno's decision to pursue him.

But Professor Kamisar said the occasional unpalatable result is no reason to abandon the double jeopardy clause. ''On the merits, I'm in favor of convicting this guy,'' he said. ''But you have to accept the fact that the principle cuts against you sometimes.''

Acceptance may not come easily. Mr. Orenstein said that the atmosphere, if not the law, was entirely changed by Mr. Nelson's admission. ''It's now a lot harder to complain that the retrial is unfair,'' he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/opinion/a-decision-on-cross-burning.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"The Supreme Court upheld a Virginia statute yesterday that makes it illegal for Ku Klux Klansmen and others to burn crosses. The case was a difficult one, forcing the court to weigh the free-expression rights of those who burn crosses against the right of their victims not to be physically intimidated and threatened with harm. The court got the balance right in a decision that upholds the ban on cross burning but warns the states against trampling on political speech.

Under Virginia law, it is illegal to burn a cross with ''intent to intimidate a person or group of persons.'' This 50-year-old cross-burning law was challenged by three men who had been convicted under it. Two of the men were convicted of attempting to burn a cross in the yard of a black neighbor. The third led a Ku Klux Klan rally at which there was a burning cross 25 to 30 feet high, accompanied by talk of going out and randomly shooting blacks.

The First Amendment's free-speech protection is not absolute. Many crimes, like filing a fraudulent tax return, are committed by means of the written word, and the Constitution does not protect them. The Supreme Court has long held, in particular, that threats of violence can be prosecuted without running afoul of the First Amendment. In its decision yesterday, the court observed that cross burning could be done either to make a general political point, in which case it is protected speech, or to convey a specific message of intimidation, in which case it is not.

The court's heavily fractured decision -- its dissents and concurrences crossed ideological lines -- sounds a welcome note of caution. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor warns that states cannot assume, or ask juries to assume, that every cross burning carries with it an intent to intimidate. The burden is on prosecutors to show, based on ''contextual factors'' surrounding a particular cross burning, that the necessary intent was present.

Yesterday's ruling gives law enforcement the authority it needs to go after cross burners. Now it is up to the states and the courts to ensure that they do so without punishing protected speech.",nytimes.com,True

Thirteen states have laws that ban cross burning.

The Supreme Court has found the relationship between hate speech and free speech troublesome for years, and the case today produced a range of opinions more amendable to a chart than to a verbal description. Here is how the justices addressed the issues in the case, Virginia v. Black, No. 01-1107:

Six justices found that a properly drafted cross burning law could be constitutional. They were Justice O'Connor and the three who joined her entire opinion -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer -- along with Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who each wrote separate opinions.

Seven justices found that the Virginia law was unconstitutional. Those were Justice O'Connor and her three allies, along with the three who regard all cross burning laws as unconstitutional: Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Anthony M. Kennedy.

Justice O'Connor said the flaw in the Virginia statute was that by permitting an inference of intent, it invited the jury to ignore ''all of the contextual factors that are necessary to decide whether a particular cross burning is intended to intimidate.''

''The First Amendment does not permit such a shortcut,'' she said.

For Justice Souter, joined by Justices Kennedy and Ginsburg, the problem with the law was not that it was a ''shortcut'' but rather the fact that in outlawing cross burning, Virginia had selected ''a symbol with particular content from the field of all proscribable expression meant to intimidate.'' They said a burning cross was inherently symbolic, carrying with it not only a message of terror but one of ideology, like ''white Protestant supremacy.'' As such, the law was ''content-based'' and could not survive First Amendment scrutiny, Justice Souter said.

In supporting criminal prohibitions against cross burning, Justice Thomas said he saw no reason at all to consider the act in light of the First Amendment, because its message was one of terror and lawlessness that did not qualify as protected expression. ''Just as one cannot burn down someone's house to make a political point and then seek refuge in the First Amendment, those who hate cannot terrorize and intimidate to make their point,'' he said.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

His separate opinion tracked closely the deeply emotional remarks he made from the bench when the case was argued in December. Then, he said a burning cross was ''unlike any symbol in our society'' and was not intended to communicate any message other than fear and hatred. ''This statute prohibits only conduct, not expression,'' he said today, adding that consequently ''there is no need to analyze it under any of our First Amendment tests.''

Justice Thomas said Virginia had not been interested in curbing racist expression in 1952, when it enacted the law, because the state had many segregationist laws on its books and was soon to begin its campaign of ''massive resistance'' to the Supreme Court's desegregation decree in Brown v. Board of Education.

''It is simply beyond belief that, in passing the statute now under review, the Virginia legislature was concerned with anything but penalizing conduct it must have viewed as particularly vicious,'' he said.

Like Justice Thomas, Justice Scalia did not find a fatal flaw in the section of the Virginia law permitting the jury to infer an intent to intimidate. But he did find that a jury had to be properly instructed so that defendants had a full chance to counter the inference by presenting evidence showing a different intent.

Justice Scalia agreed with Justice O'Connor that one of the defendants in the case, Barry E. Black, a Ku Klux Klan member who supervised a cross burning rally in an open field, had been improperly convicted. His jury was told that ''the burning of a cross by itself is sufficient evidence from which you may infer the required intent.'' Justice Scalia said Virginia should have a chance to retry Mr. Black with corrected instructions, a choice the O'Connor four did not offer to the state.

The two other defendants, Richard J. Elliott and Jonathan O'Mara, were not members of the Klan. They burned a cross on the lawn of a black neighbor. Mr. O'Mara pleaded guilty and Mr. Elliott was convicted after a trial in which the jury was required to find that he had intended to intimidate his neighbor. For that reason, Justice O'Connor said, and Justice Scalia agreed, the Virginia Supreme Court incorrectly overturned their convictions, and left open the possibility that they could be retried.

The decision was the court's first effort in a decade to revisit the question of hate speech. In a 1992 decision, R.A.V. v. St. Paul, the court invalidated a Minnesota city's ordinance making it a crime to burn a cross in the knowledge that the act would ''arouse anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.''

A lingering question from Justice Scalia's opinion for the court in that case was whether to read it broadly or narrowly: was the St. Paul ordinance's flaw its criminalization of cross burning as such, or its reference to the specific types of people who could not be permitted to be offended? At the time, some First Amendment commentators said the court was responding not so much to cross burning as to the debate then at its height over ''politically correct'' speech on college campuses and elsewhere.

Based on the decision today, it seems clear that the R.A.V. decision was a narrow ruling by which the court did not mean that cross burning could not be treated as a crime.

''A ban on cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate is fully consistent with our holding in R.A.V. and is proscribable under the First Amendment,'' Justice O'Connor said.

The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a prohibition on true threats ''protects individuals from the fear of violence'' and ''from the disruption that fear engenders,'' in addition to protecting people ''from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.'' Intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. Respondents do not contest that some cross burnings fit within this meaning of intimidating speech, and rightly so. The history of cross burning in this country shows that cross burning is often intimidating, intended to create a pervasive fear in victims that they are a target of violence.

The Supreme Court of Virginia ruled that in light of R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, even if it is constitutional to ban cross burning in a content-neutral manner, the Virginia cross-burning statute is unconstitutional because it discriminates on the basis of content and viewpoint.

It is true, as the Supreme Court of Virginia held, that the burning of a cross is symbolic expression. The reason why the Klan burns a cross at its rallies, or individuals place a burning cross on someone else's lawn, is that the burning cross represents the message that the speaker wishes to communicate. Individuals burn crosses as opposed to other means of communication because cross burning carries a message in an effective and dramatic manner.

The fact that cross burning is symbolic expression, however, does not resolve the constitutional question. The Supreme Court of Virginia relied upon R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul to conclude that once a statute discriminates on the basis of this type of content, the law is unconstitutional. We disagree.

In R.A.V., we held that a local ordinance that banned certain symbolic conduct, including cross burning, when done with the knowledge that such conduct would ''arouse anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender'' was unconstitutional. We held that the ordinance did not pass constitutional muster because it discriminated on the basis of content by targeting only those individuals who ''provoke violence'' on a basis specified in the law. The ordinance did not cover ''those who wish to use 'fighting words' in connection with other ideas -- to express hostility, for example, on the basis of political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality.'' This content-based discrimination was unconstitutional because it allowed the city ''to impose special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects.''

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

We did not hold in R.A.V. that the First Amendment prohibits all forms of content-based discrimination within a proscribable area of speech. Rather, we specifically stated that some types of content discrimination did not violate the First Amendment: ''When the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable, no significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists. Such a reason, having been adjudged neutral enough to support exclusion of the entire class of speech from First Amendment protection, is also neutral enough to form the basis of distinction within the class.''

Indeed, we noted that it would be constitutional to ban only a particular type of threat: ''The federal government can criminalize only those threats of violence that are directed against the president . . . since the reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment . . . have special force when applied to the person of the president.'' And a state may ''choose to prohibit only that obscenity which is the most patently offensive in its prurience -- i.e., that which involves the most lascivious displays of sexual activity.'' . . .

As the history of cross burning indicates, a burning cross is not always intended to intimidate. Rather, sometimes the cross burning is a statement of ideology, a symbol of group solidarity. It is a ritual used at Klan gatherings, and it is used to represent the Klan itself. Thus, ''burning a cross at a political rally would almost certainly be protected expression.'' Indeed, occasionally a person who burns a cross does not intend to express either a statement of ideology or intimidation. Cross burnings have appeared in movies such as Mississippi Burning, and in plays such as the stage adaptation of Sir Walter Scott's The Lady of the Lake.

FROM A DISSENT

By Justice Souter

I do not think that the Virginia statute qualifies for this virulence exception as R.A.V. explained it. The statute fits poorly with the illustrative examples given in R.A.V., none of which involves communication generally associated with a particular message, and in fact, the majority's discussion of a special virulence exception here moves that exception toward a more flexible conception than the version in R.A.V. I will reserve judgment on that doctrinal development, for even on a pragmatic conception of R.A.V. and its exceptions the Virginia statute could not pass muster, the most obvious hurdle being the statute's prima facie evidence provision. That provision is essential to understanding why the statute's tendency to suppress a message disqualifies it from any rescue by exception from R.A.V.'s general rule.

R.A.V. defines the special virulence exception to the rule barring content-based subclasses of categorically proscribable expression this way: prohibition by subcategory is nonetheless constitutional if it is made ''entirely'' on the ''basis'' of ''the very reason'' that ''the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable'' at all. The Court explained that when the subcategory is confined to the most obviously proscribable instances, ''no significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists,'' and the explanation was rounded out with some illustrative examples. None of them, however, resembles the case before us.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The first example of permissible distinction is for a prohibition of obscenity unusually offensive ''in its prurience,'' with citation to a case in which the Seventh Circuit discussed the difference between obscene depictions of actual people and simulations. As that court noted, distinguishing obscene publications on this basis does not suggest discrimination on the basis of the message conveyed. The opposite is true, however, when a general prohibition of intimidation is rejected in favor of a distinct proscription of intimidation by cross burning. The cross may have been selected because of its special power to threaten, but it may also have been singled out because of disapproval of its message of white supremacy, either because a legislature thought white supremacy was a pernicious doctrine or because it found that dramatic, public espousal of it was a civic embarrassment. Thus, there is no kinship between the cross burning statute and the core prurience example.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Nor does this case present any analogy to the statute prohibiting threats against the president, the second of R.A.V.'s examples of the virulence exception and the one the majority relies upon. The content discrimination in that statute relates to the addressee of the threat and reflects the special risks and costs associated with threatening the president. Again, however, threats against the president are not generally identified by reference to the content of any message that may accompany the threat, let alone any viewpoint, and there is no obvious correlation in fact between victim and message. Millions of statements are made about the president every day on every subject and from every standpoint; threats of violence are not an integral feature of any one subject or viewpoint as distinct from others. Differential treatment of threats against the president, then, selects nothing but special risks, not special messages. A content-based proscription of cross burning, on the other hand, may be a subtle effort to ban not only the intensity of the intimidation cross burning causes when done to threaten, but also the particular message of white supremacy that is broadcast even by nonthreatening cross burning. . . .

I conclude that the statute under which all three of the respondents were prosecuted violates the First Amendment, since the statute's content-based distinction was invalid at the time of the charged activities, regardless of whether the prima facie evidence provision was given any effect in any respondent's individual case. In my view, severance of the prima facie evidence provision now could not eliminate the unconstitutionality of the whole statute at the time of the respondents' conduct. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia vacating the respondents' convictions and dismissing the indictments. Accordingly, I concur in the court's judgment as to respondent Black and dissent as to respondents Elliott and O'Mara.

FROM A DISSENT

By Justice Thomas

In February 1952, in light of this series of cross burnings and attendant reports that the Klan, ''long considered dead in Virginia, is being revitalized in Richmond,'' Governor Battle announced that ''Virginia might well consider passing legislation to restrict the activities of the Ku Klux Klan.'' As newspapers reported at the time, the bill was ''to ban the burning of crosses and other similar evidences of terrorism.'' The bill was presented to the House of Delegates by a former F.B.I. agent and future two-term governor, delegate Mills E. Godwin Jr. ''Godwin said law and order in the state were impossible if organized groups could create fear by intimidation.''

That in the early 1950's the people of Virginia viewed cross burning as creating an intolerable atmosphere of terror is not surprising: although the cross took on some religious significance in the 1920's when the Klan became connected with certain Southern white clergy, by the postwar period it had reverted to its original function ''as an instrument of intimidation.''

It strains credulity to suggest that a state legislature that adopted a litany of segregationist laws self-contradictorily intended to squelch the segregationist message. Even for segregationists, violent and terroristic conduct, the Siamese twin of cross burning, was intolerable. The ban on cross burning with intent to intimidate demonstrates that even segregationists understood the difference between intimidating and terroristic conduct and racist expression. It is simply beyond belief that, in passing the statute now under review, the Virginia Legislature was concerned with anything but penalizing conduct it must have viewed as particularly vicious.

''We are being targeted as if violence is something innate to our community,'' said Dalia E. Mogahed, an business student active in Muslim concerns here. ''But we don't think we have any power to stop the targeting, so we'd rather have a working relationship with law enforcement.''

Pittsburgh has a small Muslim population, with about 7,000 Muslims in the city and surrounding counties.

Leaders of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh say they have invited F.B.I. agents to attend open houses and have helped F.B.I. recruiters find Muslims fluent in Arabic, Pashtun and Urdu. Despite this, mosque leaders say, they they believe they are under surveillance, although F.B.I. officials will not confirm or deny it.

Adel Fergany, president of the Islamic Center, said in an interview: ''There is absolutely nothing that we say to each other that we cannot say to the public. The only issue is that repeated appearances of the F.B.I. at our mosques makes our people think they are suspect.''

The Muslims here, and elsewhere, have other reasons to feel under suspicion. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (now known as the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has for months required tens of thousands of men from predominantly Muslim countries to register with their local I.N.S. office or face possible arrest and deportation. Some here have been detained on immigration violations, though no one in law enforcement could say how many. No Muslim in this region has been arrested on terrorism charges, F.B.I. officials said.

Kenneth T. McCabe, special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office of the F.B.I., praised the Muslim community's cooperation at the news conference today, and said, ''There are individuals of interest within our Pittsburgh division that we believe have supported or are willing to support terrorist activity, but we know of no sleeper cells.''

There were reports from around the country of a recent increase in anti-Muslim incidents, according to the Council on American Islamic Relations, a Washington advocacy group. A mosque in Glendale Heights, Ill., received a death threat and was burglarized.

The decision in Pittsburgh to cooperate with law enforcement has left some Muslims uncomfortable, for various reasons. Many immigrants who learned to fear police agents in their home countries are scared of interrogations and torture, and fear being deported back to oppressive regimes. African-American Muslims recall surveillance in the 60's and 70's that infiltrated leftist groups and black organizations.

Special Agent Mr. McCabe promised that the interviews would be voluntary, ''low-key, professional and respectful.''

But Witold Walczak, legal director of the local A.C.L.U. chapter, which is providing lawyers to accompany Iraqis to interviews, warned, ''The good will from the Islamic community will dissipate the moment people's constitutional rights are violated in one of these interviews.''",nytimes.com,True

His support for the suit represents a powerful condemnation of the State Legislature. His name resonates in the black Tulsa community of Greenwood, where a boulevard is named in his honor. Greenwood, such as it is, might not even exist if not for his father, the estimable lawyer B. C. Franklin (1879-1960), who was practicing in the community at the time of the riot. B. C. Franklin somehow managed to avoid being killed and was briefly held captive after the conflagration. After his release, he turned immediately to the task of fighting the city in court. The accounts of this period in his autobiography, ''My Life and an Era,'' published posthumously, will be quoted often if this newly filed lawsuit comes to trial.

In 1921, The Tulsa Tribune primed its city for the riot with months of race baiting during which it referred to Greenwood as ''niggertown.'' The immediate spark for the riot was a now-lost Tribune article that encouraged readers to lynch a jailed black man who had been accused -- falsely as it turned out -- of trying to rape a white woman. The mob that showed up to lynch the prisoner exchanged shots with a group of black men who tried to stop it.

City officials then made the fatal mistake of deputizing the white mob, to which arms were handed out indiscriminately. As many as 10,000 whites, including the police and the National Guard, poured across the tracks into Greenwood, burning, looting and shooting. One white witness reported seeing officers in uniform robbing unarmed black citizens at gunpoint and shooting those who resisted. While the police were thus engaged, an execution squad composed of Klansmen roamed the riot zone, killing black men on sight. Eyewitnesses tell of seeing corpses piled in the backs of wagons and pickup trucks or stacked along the street. Those bodies, which were never found, were thought to have been spirited into secret mass graves.

Greenwood had been a black city within a city that included as many as 15,000 people and supported 191 businesses, including 15 doctors, 2 dentists, a chiropractor and 3 law offices. After the riot, as B. C. Franklin writes: ''As far as I could see, not a Negro dwelling-house or place of business stood.'' Thousands of blacks were confined to makeshift prison camps. Those who worked for white Tulsans were allowed to go out to their jobs. But blacks were required under pain of arrest to wear or carry ID tags furnished by the city.

The principal black political leaders fled Greenwood after being indicted by a Klan-dominated legal system. B. C. Franklin remained, partly because his wife and children were safe in his hometown, Rentiesville, 65 miles away. His rooming house and law offices destroyed, he and his partners set up shop in a tent and commenced the legal battle that prevented the city from annexing Greenwood and forcing black people completely out of the city.

Echoing his father, John Hope Franklin told me in a recent telephone interview that he had joined the suit to ''turn up the heat on Tulsa and Oklahoma.''

In ''Defending France's Jews'' (editorial, Jan. 16), you note that ''disaffected North African youths'' are primarily responsible for the spate of anti-Jewish violence in France. The previous administration of Lionel Jospin addressed this problem with a mixture of denial and empty rhetoric, while the current interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, is treating the problem seriously as part of the more general crime problem affecting the country.

Your dismissal of a link between these attacks and France's Vichy past is problematic. Anti-Semitism remains casually endemic in France (conflict about the place of Jews in France goes back to the founding of the republic), but day to day it has little practical importance for the country's Jewish population.

This more fundamental subtext of anti-Semitism provides a background for understanding the country's slow and equivocal response to the problem and the cynical and self-serving rationalizations by some in its intellectual elite. Could some of these same attitudes have also supported the rise of Vichy?

The official reaction consisted of a Gallic shrug, as if to ask, What can you expect from poor Arabs when they watch brutal scenes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on television? As accusatory reminders of France's Nazi collaboration flowed in from the United States and Israel, the French establishment went from dismissive to defensive. President Jacques Chirac asserted indignantly, after his re-election last May, that France was not an anti-Semitic country.

Lately there has been a marked and welcome change. Early this month a young rabbi in Paris was stabbed at the entrance to his synagogue by a man shouting ''God is great'' in Arabic. The rabbi was only superficially wounded, but the reaction of the government was swift and on target. It included a letter from President Chirac saying, ''There can be no place in our republic for anti-Semitism,'' an investigation by the Interior Ministry and a remarkable display of solidarity at a ''service for fraternity and hope'' several days later.

Meanwhile the interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, has ordered the police to treat attacks on religious sites differently from simple property violation or arson. The National Assembly recently passed a bill making crimes committed because of a victim's real or presumed ethnicity, race or religion subject to harsher penalties. And partly in an effort to rein in more extreme Islamist tendencies, the government has created a national council to represent France's five million Muslims.

The 500,000 French Jews nonetheless remain nervous and skeptical. Last year the number of Jews moving from France to Israel doubled. While that number remains small -- an increase to 2,300 from 1,150 the previous year -- it sets a three-decade record. A poll of French Jews in November found that despite their high level of success throughout the professions, business and government, they were worried about the risk of violence and troubled by the official silence.

It remains sadly common for French intellectuals and officials to discount Jewish anxiety and to suggest that if only Israel would do right by the Palestinians, the problems of France's Jews would disappear. While a solution in the Middle East would help calm things down, this is a cynical argument.

About a dozen World Church of the Creator members stood when Mr. Hale entered a federal courtroom this afternoon for his arraignment, several of them raising their right hands in what they called a Roman salute but is more commonly known as a Nazi salute. Mr. Hale pleaded not guilty to the solicitation and obstruction of justice charges and will remain in custody until a detention hearing on Monday afternoon.

''This is totally bogus -- it's in our Constitutional rights to believe in a religion,'' said Shawn Powers, 21, a member of Mr. Hale's movement. ''We are a bona fide religion, and they are trying to take that away from us. Matt Hale is not a violent man, he doesn't advocate violence.''

The arrest revived memories of the Fourth of July weekend in 1999, when one of Mr. Hale's followers, Benjamin Smith, went on a three-day rampage in Illinois and Indiana, killing two men, one black and one Korean, and injuring nine other Jews, Asians and African-Americans before committing suicide.

Those who monitor white supremacist and other hate groups said Mr. Hale had been brilliant in using the Internet to recruit young members, luring them through a network of 30 Web sites featuring compelling graphics and interactive games. His church, ''dedicated to the survival, expansion and advancement of the white race,'' claims 70,000 members in 49 states and 28 countries, though some experts say the movement has just a few hundred adherents.

''Matt Hale has been allowed with impunity to engage in terrorist-like activity for four years now,'' Richard S. Hirschhaut, director of the Anti-Defamation League's Midwest office, said today. ''He has had blood on his hands for more than four years. He is now where he should be.''

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization based in Los Angeles, said in a statement that Mr. Hale's arrest ''could remove the most dangerous American racist of his generation.''

Mr. Hale's path crossed Judge Lefkow's after an Oregon organization known as the TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation filed a lawsuit to block Mr. Hale from using the term ''Church of the Creator,'' which it had registered as a trademark. Judge Lefkow originally ruled in favor of Mr. Hale but was overturned on appeal, and in November she ordered his group to stop using the name on the Internet and to destroy any printed materials including it.

Mr. Hale later sued Judge Lefkow, 59, who was appointed to the district court by President Bill Clinton in 2000, claiming her order violated the Constitution by requiring the destruction of the group's bibles.

''If federal judges are to sit in judgment of the people, the people must be able to sit in judgment of them,'' he said at the time. On various Web sites, Mr. Hale has urged followers to picket Judge Lefkow's church, and has referred to her as ''a white woman married to a Jew with three mixed grandchildren.''

Glenn Greenwald, a lawyer for Mr. Hale, said the charges filed today might stem from a misinterpretation of a statement by his client on the Internet that ''we are in a state of war with Judge Lefkow.''

''They are probably trying to take things he said along the lines of political advocacy and turn it into a crime,'' Mr. Greenwald said. ''The F.B.I. may have interpreted this protected speech as a threat against a federal judge, but it's probably nothing more than some heated rhetoric.''

The body of Eddie Araujo Jr., 17, who dressed as a woman and went by the name Gwen, was discovered on Oct. 16. Missing since Oct. 3, he had been beaten, strangled and buried in a shallow grave. Four men have been charged in the murder, all of whom were former students at Newark Memorial.

Mr. Kaufman, who attended the emotional opening-night performance of ''The Laramie Project'' on Nov. 8, said: ''What the Newark school received was very specific and very powerful. When they were talking about the crime, the entire audience was sobbing horrifically because they were reliving something that had happened less than two weeks before in that town. The kids told me: 'Oh, my God, we're Laramie. We're speaking these words, and they are about us.' ''

Barbara Williams, who has been a theater instructor at Newark Memorial for 38 years and directed the student production of ''The Laramie Project,'' said in a telephone interview that she chose the play as a teaching tool. Even though Newark is a fairly prosperous and multiracial community only 35 miles from gay-friendly San Francisco, Ms. Williams said: ''Our community is not very tolerant of alternate lifestyles. I know because I teach these senior boys. Two years ago I had a boy who beat up a gay guy because he looked at him funny in the coffee shop. That's an underlying current that's been boiling here.''

A different set of circumstances obtained on the campus of the University of Maryland in College Park, where a published edition of ''The Laramie Project'' was given to incoming freshmen this year, ''to provide all entering students with a shared intellectual experience,'' said Phyllis Peres, the dean of undergraduate studies. Previous first-year books have included ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' and ''The Autobiography of Frederick Douglass.''

''We had had an eventful year,'' Ms. Peres said. ''Among other things, we were very affected by 9/11. We lost alumni and others associated with the university. We were looking for a text that addressed what a community does when traumatic things happen. Matthew Shepard was a first-year student at the University of Wyoming; we felt students could identify with him and the struggle to fit into a new community.''

Ms. Peres noted that hate crimes are an issue on campus. ''The school is very diverse, racially and ethnically,'' she said. ''The minority population on campus is 30 percent. This brings together different cultural groups with all their baggage. Hate crimes take place in residence halls, and most are written or verbal intimidation -- things written on boards outside dorm rooms. There were approximately 40 hate crimes reported in the last academic year. About half had to do with sexual orientation.

''A lot of people have been saying that the play is not about homosexuality,'' Ms. Peres continued. ''But it really is. At the center of the play is the fact that this first-year student was savagely murdered because he was gay. But the play is also about community and what happens when people with extraordinarily different beliefs are suddenly forced to deal with this. You can look at it from a legal perspective or an artistic perspective, but it also asks our students to look at themselves and ask: 'Could this happen here? If it did, what would we do?' The two young men who murdered Matthew Shepard were the sons of people who lived next door. To me, that makes this a powerful play. No matter what your religious beliefs, what do you do when your next-door neighbor's son has committed this crime?''

The same weekend that the Newark, Calif., production opened, I attended a high school production of ''The Laramie Project'' at the Newark Academy in Livingston, N.J., a private school. I met with Scott Jacoby, the veteran teacher who staged the play and, like Barbara Williams, he was acutely aware of the play's impact on the students who performed in it.

''We did the second act at an assembly for the whole school,'' Mr. Jacoby said, ''and afterward one of the administrators asked, 'Given your involvement for the last two months, how would you like to see Newark Academy change as a result of this play?' One kid said, 'I'd just like to stop hearing the words gay or faggot.'

''Kids use gay as an all-purpose putdown,'' Mr. Jacoby went on, '' 'such a gay idea, such a gay class.' They don't know what they're saying. As a result of two months of work, my kids have heightened their sensitivity.''

In a forum after the performance, the student actors confirmed as much. ''This wasn't just a play but it was about educating ourselves,'' said Tiffany Bergin, 17, a senior. Juan Trillo, 16, a junior who had never been in a play before, said: ''We didn't just get together to rehearse our lines. We came together and spoke about our feelings.''

The Newark Academy production helped me understand why so many schools have sought out ''The Laramie Project.'' In practical terms, it is perfect for schools because there are parts for many students. Although originally eight actors played all the roles, Mr. Jacoby used 18 and Ms. Williams used 20. It is also a compelling piece of storytelling that even nonprofessional performers can do well. And much of what the play has to convey as a teaching tool is embedded not just in its content but in its form. No one portrays one character alone; everyone has to represent multiple, sometimes opposing points of view.

''The Laramie Project'' is ultimately a meeting between two communities: a community of speakers (the residents of Laramie) and a community of listeners (the Tectonic Theater members who interviewed them). As a theater event, it serves as a model for a way of speaking tough truths and listening respectfully -- a form of communication that human beings crave but that is rarely experienced these days anywhere in public, especially in the news media, where sound-bites pass for insight and competing monologues masquerade as debate.

The play doesn't deliver a message that can be summed up in a bumper sticker, but the essence of it is captured in the tag line that Mr. Kaufman chose for the HBO film: ''Each one carries a piece of the story.''",nytimes.com,True

But here along the lonely blacktop, both black people and white people will say that they remember, yes, but not a lot, that most of the people associated with the crime are dust and bones, that they would just as soon not speak about it. Here, like the roads that go no place special and the leftover cotton and that store that refuses to fall down under the weight of time, the story of Emmett Till is just one more half-done thing.

HUNDREDS of miles away, in a kitchen in Chicago, an old woman of long memory defies her doctor and prepares a feast for her 81st birthday. For Mamie Till Mobley, Emmett's mother, the table will be set with turkey, beef roast, oyster dressing, gravy, mixed greens, collards, cabbage, macaroni and cheese, string beans and rutabagas.

She is not a woman, her friends say, who leaves anything half done.

''We will have sweet potato pie,'' she said.

It is not the way a woman who has given up on living celebrates her birthday. Mrs. Mobley enjoys living, because on every day she lives she reminds the world of the sweetness of her son, of the wrongfulness of his murder and of the God who took him for a reason. ''He wanted to be a motorcycle policeman,'' she said, but God made him a martyr.

Now, perhaps as much as in any time since she chose to open his casket to the world so people could see the cruelty done to him, ''it looks like Emmett is surfacing once again,'' Mrs. Mobley said.

She is writing a book, along with Chris Benson, a Chicago lawyer and writer who grew up with the specter of Emmett's death, on the case and the legacy of her son. And she is the emotional anchor of a new documentary, ''The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,'' a film by Keith Beauchamp, who, like Mr. Benson, is haunted by an image of the murdered boy in an open coffin.

''Of the thousands of lynchings that occurred since Reconstruction, the one name everybody remembers is Emmett Till,'' said Mr. Benson. ''It burned the race problem into our consciousness, the first international coverage, the first real media event of the modern civil rights movement. And no one ever had to pay.''

Some state officials in Mississippi have even said that the new attention being shown to the case, as well as new information about the involvement of others in the murder brought out in the documentary, could lead to a reopening of the long-cold investigation.

Roy Bryant, the store owner and the husband of the woman behind the counter, and J. W. Milam, his friend, were the primary suspects, and they admitted -- in a magazine interview that they later said was untrue -- that they had abducted and killed Emmett. They are both dead.

BUT there may have been others -- one witness said it was a caravan of cars that came after Emmett, not a single one -- and Mrs. Mobley would like to see all the rats run out from under the bed.

But even in years when it seemed there would never be any more justice for her son than what he got in Mississippi, she kept his memory alive with words, at talks and speeches and discussions.

For her, this is just the latest round in a fight that has lasted more than half her long life, and will last for quite some time to come.

''At first, I just wanted to go in a hole and hide my face from the world,'' she said, thinking back to the day she knew her son was dead. But she soon learned that would not work, so she started to talk. In time, it became almost an evangelism.

''The Lord told me, 'I have taken one, but I shall give you thousands in these troubled times,' '' she said.

In her mind, her son was not merely the victim of an inhuman act by men, but a sacrifice. It is not something she has wrapped around the raw place in her memory over time, but something she knew from the start.

''I really have no idea what I would have done if I had not believed in God and called on him for his help,'' she said. ''I know when his presence filled my room. He told me that Emmett was not mine, that he was his, that I should have been thankful to have had him, that he was down here to do a job and he had done it well.

''God sent his son so that men might have a choice between eternal life and eternal damnation. My son Emmett came so that men might have peace and freedom here on earth.''

In the written history of the crime, it is more base than that. Some people said Emmett wolf-whistled at the woman behind the counter, after telling some friends that black men could be friendly with white women up north.

But Mrs. Mobley doubts that. If her theory about what happened is true, then the killing is even more monstrous than ever believed.

''At age 5, he came down with polio,'' Mrs. Mobley said of her son. ''He would go out and play every day, and at night he would burn up with fever. The doctor told my mother to quarantine the house.''

He recovered, but ''he hesitated in his speech, and then he developed a full stutter,'' she continued. ''We wanted him to be able to express himself and not take all day doing it. I started teaching him various speeches, like the Gettysburg Address and the Preamble to the Constitution. And when he would stutter, I would just say, 'Just whistle,' because the whistling relieves the tension.''

She believes he was just tongue-tied as he came out of the store after buying a piece of bubble gum, and he whistled, and a few days later Roy Bryant and J. W. Milam beat him to death for it.

The key point made by Mr. Beauchamp in his documentary is that Mr. Bryant and Mr. Milam ''did not act alone,'' he said. ''More people were involved in the murder: three other white men and four black men.''

An even deeper horror is that the black men, he believes, were forced to participate -- that they were so frightened of their employers that they would even stand by as a black youth was murdered.

Mr. Beauchamp's research produced one man who said he witnessed this, though he was not involved in the murder itself. It is this witness who could lead investigators to other suspects, some of them still alive, Mr. Beauchamp said.

''I heard this story as a child,'' he said. ''But it is deeper than I ever thought.''

It is terrifying for the people who grew up with the story of Emmett Till to believe that it is darker still.

''It haunts,'' said Mr. Benson, Mrs. Mobley's co-author. As a child, growing up in the North, it was a puzzling thing. ''To realize that there were people very bad out there who could hurt us, for things that seemed not important? The story was told as a cautionary. 'This is out there, and you have to be careful.' ''

Mrs. Mobley said: ''I have not spent one minute hating. Once, I had a dream I was walking alone across a bridge, a long, long bridge, and I looked down and the waters were real black, and the waters were troubled, and they were moving, cresting.''

Even though she could not see them, she knew her son's killers were down in that water. ''And the Spirit said, 'I have suspended you high above.' ''",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Beauchamp grew up obsessed with this case and has spent more than six years of his young life tracking down and filming witnesses, some of whom had never spoken for the public record. At the time of the trial, Tallahatchie County was two-thirds black, but not a single black name could be found on county voting rolls or in the jury pool. Two black men who were agitating for voting rights had already been killed when Emmett Till arrived to visit his relatives.

Some of the fear that ruled black life in Mississippi 50 years ago still hovers in the air. One local man, trying to prevent Mr. Beauchamp from filming, told him that he was putting people in danger because ''the people who did this killing still live around here.'' Two witnesses asked to be filmed in silhouette, out of fear that they might be hurt or killed for talking. One of them, just a child in 1955, recalled seeing two black men washing blood from a pickup truck similar to the one used in the abduction. When asked where the blood had come from, the men said that they had been deer hunting.

According to the witness, one of the men washing away blood was Henry Lee Loggins, an occasional employee of Mr. Milam, one of the two men tried. A man identified in the film as Mr. Loggins denies that he had anything to do with the killing. But Mississippi officials and the United States Justice Department should be interested in his claim that the local sheriff falsely arrested and jailed him for six months, around the time of the trial. For years, watchers of this case believed that Mr. Loggins was dead and that he had been jailed at the time of the trial to prevent his being called as a witness. This also kept him away from civil rights investigators and the newspaper reporters who swamped the county.

The grounding personality in this film is Emmett's mother, Mamie Till Mobley. Ms. Mobley has lived half a century with the knowledge that the legal system in Mississippi conspired to disregard her son's murder and let the killers go. Her descriptions of the angry crowd that greeted her at the courthouse door and the attempt by state officials to dispose of Emmett's mutilated body to tamp down publicity should be required viewing for young Americans who wish to know why the civil rights struggle was necessary.

In the minds of many Mississippians in 1955, a black man could justifiably be lynched even for looking at a white woman. Emmett was tortured and killed for allegedly ''wolf whistling'' at Mr. Bryant's wife, Carolyn, a storekeeper in Money, Miss. One of the tragedies of this case is that the so-called ''wolf whistle'' was probably a misunderstanding. Emmett had a speech impediment. When he got stuck on a word, he would stop speaking and abruptly whistle, as a way of untangling his tongue.

While the Russian government does not keep statistics on racially motivated crimes, the African ambassadors, in their appeals to the authorities, have reported more than 140 attacks since 2000. At least four Africans have been killed in those attacks.

''Maybe they think they're doing enough,'' General Mahama said in an interview today, referring to the Moscow police and Russian security officials, ''but we have yet to see the results.''

The attacks have been attributed to socially and economically disenfranchised Russian men, many of them skinheads or neo-Nazis, who turn their anger on ethnic or racial minorities. But critics have also complained about the indifference of investigators and police officers, who often classify racial attacks as hooliganism or simple assaults and who often themselves view dark-skinned people with suspicion.

General Mahama, who said he frequently visits Victory Park, recalled being stopped by the police three times during a single visit. ''Three times they checked my documents,'' he said. ''But yesterday there were no police to be seen.''

''He's pragmatic, he's opportunistic and he's very shrewd, politically.''

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A review of Mr. Pataki's record reveals the paradox. He has lowered taxes but increased spending, increased aid to schools but challenged a court-ordered restructuring of school finance formulas, increased the open land under state protection but fallen short of his own goals on greenhouse gases. There are more jobs under his watch, but upstate New York is hurting economically. He has expanded access to health care, particularly for low-income families, but the mentally ill languish in adult homes and nursing homes.

The governor's own words complicate the task of assessing his record. He declined to be interviewed for this article. But on many issues, he has set out on a fairly conservative course, then taken a turn to the left. Democrats complain that he has a habit of joining the parade midway through the march, then claiming to lead it.

Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's communications director, said the governor had been consistent. ''There are basic principles that he believes in: tax cuts, controlling spending, reducing welfare, a tough approach on crime,'' Mr. McKeon said. ''He has always been a social moderate. He's pro-choice, he opposes discrimination in any form, and he's stood up against anti-immigrant policies.''

What are often taken as changes in the governor's outlook are a product of changing times, Mr. McKeon said. ''We inherited a $5 billion deficit, and then later there were record surpluses,'' he said. ''The governor has worked hard to control the Legislature's impulse to spend more than we can afford. But the governor has always been eager, when the resources have become available, to put them into providing good services.''

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Still, much of Mr. Pataki's record begs the question: Should he be judged on what he proposed, or what he later agreed to? How many of his original stances are merely bargaining positions, as administration officials say, taken to hold back the Legislature's excesses?

With those questions in mind, here is a review of Mr. Pataki's eight-year record in some major areas.

Taxes and Spending

Tax cuts were the central promise of Mr. Pataki's 1994 campaign and the signal achievement of his first term. The governor maintains that he has cut 19 different taxes 63 times, reducing taxes more than any other state.

His opponents complain that New York's state and local taxes are the highest in the nation and that property taxes are rising fast.

Both sides are right.

''We've dropped from No. 1 in the nation, all the way down to No. 1 in the nation,'' said Brian Backstrom, president of Change New York, a conservative group.

Lawmakers have eliminated the income tax on suburbanites who work in New York City, the tax on utility bills and the state sales tax on most clothing, among others. But the biggest state tax, the one Mr. Pataki cut most deeply, is the personal income tax. New Yorkers are paying 21 percent less than they would be paying if the law had been left as it was in 1994, a savings of more than $5 billion a year.

But by another measure, known as the effective tax rate, income taxes have declined far less. In 1994, New Yorkers paid 4.95 percent of their incomes in state income tax. In 2001, it was 4.7 percent, because the prosperity of the intervening years greatly increased the share of income taxed at the highest rates.

The income tax cuts also made the system more progressive -- that is, the lower the income, the greater the savings, proportionally. That was true of Mr. Pataki's original 1995 plan, and the Legislature pushed it further in that direction.

''If you look at the whole array of tax cuts, they've been very significant, and they've been distributed in a way that benefits every taxpayer,'' said Carole E. Stone, Mr. Pataki's budget director.

''There was a conscious decision made not to open the governor to the charge of doing a tax cut that favored the rich,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, who, as a Pataki aide, helped plan the 1995 cuts.

The second-biggest Pataki tax cut was the Star program, under which the state helps pay the property tax bills school districts charge to homeowners, saving them $2.8 billion a year. But conservative critics say Star has masked fast-rising school taxes.

''School districts have probably taken back something in the range of one-third of the total value of Star, by raising taxes faster than they otherwise would have,'' said Robert B. Ward, director of research at the Business Council of New York State.

Critics, liberal and conservative, argue that Star was less a tax cut than a popular way to redistribute money, particularly to suburban school districts. Frank Mauro of the liberal Fiscal Policy Institute also argues that renters got none of the benefit.

Ms. Stone said such criticism is unfair. ''Looking back, it's hard to know, would taxes have behaved differently had Star not occurred,'' she said. ''The fact is, the homeowners got a real benefit, and that many seniors now are not paying school property taxes.''

Despite the cuts, state tax collections have risen under Mr. Pataki, driven mostly by rising incomes and spending, though not as fast as they did nationally. People and businesses are expected to pay $43 billion in New York State taxes and fees this fiscal year, an inflation-adjusted increase of 9 percent since the governor took office, compared with a national average of about 20 percent.

Local taxes also rose during the same period. According to a 1999 Census Bureau study, New York and Connecticut were roughly tied for the nation's highest combined state and local taxes.

The administration says that if it were not for Mr. Pataki's tax cuts, state taxes would be almost $14 billion a year higher, a figure that independent analysts call exaggerated. Mr. McMahon puts the net savings at $9.5 billion a year.

As for spending, as Mr. Golisano often notes, New York State's budget is $90 billion, up from $62 billion when Mr. Pataki took office. That is a 21 percent increase after inflation, somewhat below the national average, mostly to cover increases in Medicaid and education.

Mr. Pataki was the first governor in memory to save a significant amount for a rainy day, but most of that surplus was used on large spending increases in the last two budgets as the election approached, leaving a glum outlook for next year.

New York is the most deeply indebted state; it has been for decades.

Health Care

There is no clearer example of Mr. Pataki's beginning as a conservative, and then turning sharply to the left, than in health care.

In his first term he cut Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing homes, and reduced state regulation of hospitals. But he has since given money back to those same institutions in stages, culminating in a $1.8 billion deal struck in January.

What that leaves as Mr. Pataki's main health care legacy is a broad expansion of coverage for the uninsured -- the most significant increase in government-subsidized medical care to be found anywhere in the country, in a state that already ranked as the most generous.

New York's Children's Health Insurance Program covers more than 500,000 children, its Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Program helps more than 300,000 older people pay for prescription drugs and, after the Sept. 11 attack, the state enrolled 400,000 people in temporary ''disaster relief Medicaid.''

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

New programs to help low- and moderate-income adults get insurance have been slow to start, but they cover more than 100,000 people.

Robert Hinckley, deputy health commissioner, sees no contradiction in the Pataki record. ''All of this is a natural outgrowth of the things he wanted to do, to make the system more efficient and provide better services to people,'' he said.

Mr. Pataki has disappointed business groups by agreeing to impose mandates on private insurance, like infertility treatment, which employers say will drive up costs for everyone.

But if Mr. Pataki has been generous to health care generally, he has not been for the mentally ill. He continued shrinking the state's mental hospitals to save money, but the discharged residents were far sicker than those released in the early years of deinstitutionalization. At the same time, he cut the state's investment in community-based treatment for the mentally ill.

As a result, thousands more mental patients are warehoused in adult homes and nursing homes, where they are often dangerously neglected, as documented in a series of articles this year by The New York Times.

Education

Year after year, Mr. Pataki proposed little or no increase in aid to schools and then, in negotiations with the Legislature, agreed to large increases. State aid for school operations rose from under $10 billion to more than $14 billion, and construction aid also climbed steeply.

An ambitious agreement with the Legislature, to pay for prekindergarten classes and other early-childhood programs, has stalled. Mr. Pataki at first lauded the effort, then tried to kill it to cut costs, postponing the final phases indefinitely.

Mr. Pataki has eliminated the longstanding practice of giving slightly less aid per student to New York City than the statewide average. Yet he vigorously contested a lawsuit that challenged financing for urban districts. When a Manhattan judge ruled against the state, issuing a scathing catalog of the New York City schools' inadequacies, Mr. Pataki appealed and won.

The appellate panel found that the state was not obliged to provide more than a middle-school education, a ruling the governor at first welcomed. Under political pressure, he recently disavowed the notion that an eighth-grade education was sufficient. The case is now headed for New York's highest court.

This year, Mr. Pataki and the Legislature gave the city a $400 million loan to raise teachers' salaries, winning him the teachers' union's endorsement. And after years of wrangling, state lawmakers agreed this year to something Mr. Pataki had long sought, mayoral control of New York City's schools.

How all this affects student performance is difficult to assess. Test scores have risen a bit, but some experts give more credit to the higher standards set by school officials and the State Board of Regents, over which the governor has no control.

Toward higher education, Mr. Pataki has been far less friendly. He raised tuition at public colleges sharply in 1995, and tried to raise it again in 1997. It remains, however, near the national average.

In his first year, Mr. Pataki also cut state aid to the colleges and tuition aid to low-income students. Adjusted for inflation, both are now about the same as in 1994. He tried to cut tuition aid several more times, but the Legislature refused.

The Environment

Mr. Pataki's oratory on environmental issues has exceeded his performance in all areas but conservation, partly because he has promised so much.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

He announced that he would impose the nation's toughest restrictions on power plant emissions, a major source of smog, acid rain and greenhouse gases. Three years later, there are no regulations, and draft versions show that the cuts in emissions will not be quite as deep as Mr. Pataki had promised.

He appointed a task force on greenhouse gases last year, directing it to come up with plans to make New York the national leader in combating global warming. After aiming for a June release date, the task force disagreed over a consultant's bold recommendations, and postponed its decisions until after the election.

While he has gotten a very resistant Metropolitan Transportation Authority to promise to convert 500 of its more than 3,000 buses from diesel to cleaner-burning natural gas, many of the nation's other urban transit agencies have done more.

''He's created this super-environmentalist image, always comparing himself to Teddy Roosevelt, but the truth just isn't on the same level,'' said Val Washington, executive director of the group Environmental Advocates.

One area where environmentalists are unanimous in praising the governor is wilderness preservation. He has struck deals with private landowners and conservation groups to keep hundreds of thousands of acres undeveloped.

''He's been a terrific governor in the sense of conservation,'' said John Adams, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''You couldn't ask for someone who has done more or cares more in terms of land protection, parks, wildlife.''

To protect New York City's Catskills watershed, Mr. Pataki, over local opposition, struck a deal that environmentalists praised, though they now question its effectiveness.

And after years of refusing to take a position, last year he endorsed dredging the Hudson River to remove PCB's, helping persuade the Bush administration to order it done.

But he also reduced the number of environmental conservation workers monitoring compliance with the laws, and the department reduced fines against polluters. Critics argue he is easy on corporate polluters, but the administration contends it achieves more through cooperative action.

Cleanup of toxic waste sites has been a problem; the state's program ran out of money last year, and a dispute over renewing it is unresolved. Mr. Pataki wants to expand the program to include many more sites, but environmentalists and legislators are divided over his proposals to reduce the costs paid by industry and to ease cleanup standards in some cases.

''Nationally, he has to be considered among the top governors, maybe the top,'' said Mr. Adams, one of the environmentalists closest to Mr. Pataki.

Ms. Washington said: ''The governor hasn't been bad, but there has been a series of hints that something great was about to happen, and then it doesn't.''

Economic Development

Under Mr. Pataki, New York has gained 600,000 jobs, and in recent years has matched the national growth rate for the first time in decades.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Yet upstate New York's economy has continued to atrophy. While the New York City metropolitan region gained 1 million people from 1990 to 2000, Buffalo lost 35,000 people, Rochester 12,000 and Syracuse 17,000.

Much of the job growth of Mr. Pataki's tenure stemmed from a roaring stock market. Similarly, much of the state's current trouble can be traced to the weakening of that market, and to the World Trade Center attack. What a governor can do about all that is debatable.

Business groups say Governor Pataki has reduced the regulatory burden on businesses, eliminated hundreds of rules and won changes in the worker's compensation law that lowered employers' insurance premiums by more than 30 percent.

Mr. Pataki has also persuaded some large companies -- like I.B.M., which built a major computer chip plant in East Fishkill -- to remain in New York or to locate there, offering grants, loans and tax breaks. This year, a consortium of computer chip makers agreed to build a new research center in Albany.

But critics like Mr. Golisano say Mr. Pataki's economic policies have been too focused on giveaways to major corporations, while neglecting small businesses that are the core of the state's economy and job growth.

In the last three years, the governor has adopted a legislative plan to lure companies to blighted areas by declaring them Empire Zones and providing tax breaks, and he has promoted high-tech research, most notably by creating ''Centers of Excellence'' at state university campuses. He has also seized on gambling as a form of economic development, finally winning passage last year of a law allowing up to six Indian casinos and putting slot-type machines at race tracks. The effectiveness of all these measures remains to be seen.

Ethics and Reform

After the 1994 election, Mr. Pataki created two funds to pay for transition and inaugural expenses. Promising a new era of openness and rectitude, he said the funds would abide by campaign contribution limits and make their records public.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

They did neither. The records were released three years later under an Assembly subpoena. They showed that corporations had given more than allowed under the campaign finance law, the funds had paid large bonuses to Pataki aides, and they raised three times as much as the Pataki camp had said.

No laws were broken, but the promise of a new day was.

''I don't know if the ethical lapses have been any better or worse than previous administrations,'' said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''But the governor hasn't done anything to make it better, and there has been a troubling habit of secrecy.''

Ethical questions have arisen about Mr. Pataki's practice of giving paid speeches (a practice he hid for almost a year); his 1995 and 1996 trips to Hungary, which were indirectly paid for by Philip Morris and other corporations with business before the state; and the millions of dollars raised by his campaigns from companies doing business with the state.

Mr. Golisano has reminded voters that a Pataki fund-raiser was accused of trying to trade paroles for campaign contributions. The fund-raiser was convicted of covering up his actions and three Parole Board officials were convicted of lying to investigators about the affair. A jury deadlocked on the pay-for-parole charge.

Several people close to the governor have made a great deal of money from their connections to him, and Democrats have frequently questioned the governor's habit of appointing political allies, friends and family members to government jobs.

Mr. McKeon said that Mr. Pataki had reduced the number of patronage appointments a governor makes. As for political connections of the appointees, lobbyists and contractors, he said: ''There's always going to be cynics, and there's no controlling that. The people appointed by the governor have met the highest standards.''

Questions have also been raised about the governor's wife, Libby, who earns $200,000 a year as a part-time consultant to several business interests, including Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics magnate, who is a major financial backer of Mr. Pataki's.

On government reform, Mr. Pataki has advocated an initiative and referendum system, but did not push the Legislature on the issue until this year, as he sought the backing of Independence Party leaders. He has proposed new campaign finance restrictions and term limits, but has not worked hard to promote either. His campaign this year violates his own 1994 pledge to limit himself to two terms.

Mr. Pataki has opposed attempts by the lobbying commission, good-government groups and legislative leaders to to change a major loophole that allows lobbying for state contracts to go unreported.

In 1996 and 2000, Mr. Pataki worked to exclude insurgent Republican candidates from New York's presidential primary ballot, then said he regretted the effort. He lowered some of New York's notorious ballot access barriers after the 1996 primary, and tried again in 2000, but that effort has stalled.",nytimes.com,True

The jury found two residents of Newberry Street, Gregory H. Neff, 54, and Robert N. Messersmith, 53, guilty of second-degree murder. Prosecutors said Mr. Messersmith fired the shot that killed Ms. Allen, while Mr. Neff fired three times at her white Cadillac.

The other defendant, Charlie Robertson, was a popular policeman at the time of the riots and later was the garrulous, energetic mayor of York, a blue-collar town of 41,000, from 1994 to 2001.

Mr. Robertson left the courthouse in York last night in tears.

''I'm going home and I'm stressed out and tired,'' he told reporters, according to an account on the Web site of The York Daily Record. ''You people don't know what it's like to be 68 years old and oppressed for nothing.''

During the trial, prosecutors said Mr. Robertson provided ammunition to white vigilantes during the 1969 riots and incited them to riot, in retaliation for the killing of a 22-year-old white York police officer.

''There has been a a little tweaking of memories after 33 years,'' Mr. Costopoulos told the jury.

Prosecutors said local news coverage of the 30th anniversary of the riots in 1999 had prompted people to come forward with fresh evidence that allowed them to reopen the case.

After the verdict was read last night at 6:30, Mr. Costopoulos kissed Mr. Robertson's hand gently. The families of the two other defendants were clearly distraught, and a woman sitting behind Mr. Messersmith collapsed in tears.

''We're extremely happy,'' said Thomas H. Kelley, the lead prosecutor. ''After 33 years, for justice to be done for this family, we are satisfied.''

When it was read, , the verdict led to harsh words between some members of the Allen family and others in the courtroom. As deputies led the family to an elevator, someone in the Allen group exclaimed, ''They just let a man get away with murder.''

But in comments to reporters, the family appeared reconciled to the verdict.

''Justice is not perfect, but it is all we've got,'' said Ms. Allen's son, Michael, who was 9 at the time of the 1969 shooting.

''I think if she was here, she would have compassion on all people, but at the same time she would want all who was accountable to stand up and say what they done,'' he said. ' Although he was not called to testify, Mr. Robertson has admitted shouting ''white power'' at a rally shortly before the Allen killing. ''That was the talk of the time,'' he said, but he insisted that he had shed any bias through years of public service and sensitivity training.

Mr. Kelley told the jury that the 1969 riots resulted in part from ''an uneasy alliance'' between Mr. Robertson, other police officers and white vigilantes.

He charged that Mr. Robertson, then 35, advised whites to kill as many blacks as they could because ''the score isn't even.'' That charge was denied by Mr. Costopoulos, who pointed out in court that criminal and civil rights investigations at the time did not incriminate Mr. Robertson.

In 1970, a federal judge dismissed a suit by black residents who contended that their rights were violated when York police swept through their homes during the 1969 riots. But the judge called Officer Robertson's behavior at a rally ''outrageous and reprehensible.''",nytimes.com,True

''The intolerance out there is fairly substantial,'' said Denise Leclair, executive director of the International Foundation for Gender Education.

With 750 Middle Eastern immigrants having been detained without explanation, and at least twice that number interviewed at random by the authorities, many here find themselves wondering who is listening in on their phone lines, and whether they might be the next to be named an enemy combatant.

''After Sept. 11, we worried about being targeted, being suspected,'' said Hassan Jaber, deputy director of the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, known as Access. ''A year has made it clear that Arab-Americans are the targets, Muslim-Americans are the targets.''

Complaints to the Council on American-Islamic Relations -- from verbal abuse to violence, job loss to denial of access to public facilities -- increased threefold this year, to 1,516. This summer, nearly half the 945 Muslims that the group surveyed said their lives had deteriorated over the last year. A poll in May by the Arab American Institute Foundation found 40 percent of Arab-Americans knew someone who had been discriminated against since Sept. 11; one in five -- mainly the young, Muslim or foreign-born -- said they had experienced discrimination themselves.

Some community leaders do see an upside: the public's increased interest in Islam has allowed them to forge bonds with other faith groups. Apathy has given way to activism, with a surge in voter registration and turnout motivated by the perceived threat to civil liberties.

Still, many say they feel doubly victimized, first suffering along with the rest of the nation during the attacks, now feeling hated both by Americans and by Muslims abroad.

Ismael Ahmed, executive director of Access, said requests for mental health services were up at least 10 percent. ''It's not just that more people need more help, it's what they're saying when they come in to get help,'' he explained. ''People suffering from depression talk about racism. People suffering from psychosis, the person chasing them around is F.B.I. or C.I.A.''

For some, the impact has been more direct -- and more devastating. Ahmed Esa lost his job. Dean Hachem lost his profit margin. Saleh Almansoop lost his father.

Ali Almansoop's name will not be read at any of the memorials on the anniversary of 9/11. His picture will not appear among victims' photos in the newspapers. Instead, it tops the mantel in the modest home here where Saleh, 26, a restaurant dishwasher and busboy, is now responsible for the $1,500 mortgage, a $420-a-month car lease, and the care of his mother and three younger siblings, who arrived recently from Yemen.

Ali Almansoop, who had lived in America for 32 years, was killed Sept. 19 in one of a dozen murders nationwide attributed to anti-Muslim sentiment after the attacks. Among the victims were Sikhs mistaken for Muslims. Brent Seever, who was convicted of the shooting in June, said he was incensed at Mr. Almansoop's relationship with his former girlfriend, but also told the police, ''I was motivated by all this terroristic activity.''

Saleh Almansoop said of his father's slaying: ''Same terrorists, this is the same. Same New York, same killed my dad. I lose my dad, I lose everything.''

LIKE Ali Almansoop, Ahmed Esa came from Yemen without his wife and children, in 1976. He worked as a welder in a factory for 15 years -- until Sept. 12, when his boss sent him home, screaming, ''Go pray,'' and, ''Go to your leader.'' Mr. Esa is now suing the company, IW&S.

Paul Rokoczy, the company president, said that he sent Mr. Esa home mainly because he had little for him to do that day, and because ''the religious activity bothered me, because of the bombing.''

Mr. Esa, 53, refused to return the following week. He eventually found a job as a security guard.

Dean Hachem had always felt welcome in the heavily Jewish suburb of Orchard Lake, where he opened his restaurant, the Sheik, in 1996.

But on Sept. 11, an e-mail message spread like cholera saying that employees at the Sheik were seen celebrating in front of the television that noon. Though security videotapes showed no such thing, the ensuing boycott has ruined Mr. Hachem's business; he is closing his second restaurant, in a nearby mall, this month; receipts are still down 30 percent at the original restaurant.

''You feel like you've been stabbed,'' he said on one recent dinner hour, when 30 of the 39 tables sat empty. ''When you get accused of something, you have nothing to do with it, you cannot focus your mind.''

Such a response was expected, and perhaps inevitable, in the weeks after the attacks. What is surprising is that it has not subsided. Just last month, a woman came into Play Ball, the sporting goods store that Mohamed Odetalle owns in suburban Westland, looking for a Red Wings jersey. She left without buying, only to head for the Play Ball store in a mall across the street -- which Mr. Odetalle also owns but never works at -- where she paid $10 more for the jersey.

''I knew the lady was uncomfortable; she and her husband were whispering,'' Mr. Odetalle said, shrugging. Other customers, he said, have told his manager at the mall that they would rather pay extra than do business with the foreigner across the street.

Basim Alkhateeb was in his native Jordan, where he is a major in the military, on Sept. 11. He came to the United States in January to pursue a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Oakland University. On June 20, Mr. Alkhateeb was on his way to take a final exam when, he said, an undercover police officer pulled a gun on him in suburban Waterford.

''The first question, 'Are you Arabic?' '' Mr. Alkhateeb, 36, remembered. ''I told him, 'Yes, I'm Arabic.' He pushed me to the ground.''

Mr. Alkhateeb added: ''He began to beat on my back and my leg. He still had his gun against my head and my face. I didn't understand him. I'm just waiting for his gun to explode.''

Mr. Alkhateeb was not arrested; he is planning to file a lawsuit -- and to return to Jordan. ''I feel we are not welcome here, everybody hates us,'' he said. '' ''It may happen in my country. It may happen in any country, but in America? It's incredible.''",nytimes.com,True

The police also seized cartoons drawn by Mr. Felton that depict a white supremacist who goes to jail and, upon release, plants bombs at Anti-Defamation League offices and black housing projects.

Lenore Glaser, the lawyer for Mr. Felton, said in opening arguments that the drawings showed that her client was an artist and that even if many people disagreed with his views, he had the right to express them.

''The government has colored its entire case with ideas, with political speech,'' Ms. Glaser said.

Mr. Felton and Ms. Chase were members of white power groups, the authorities said. Mr. Felton belonged to the White Order of Thule, and Ms. Chase was affiliated with the World Church of the Creator. The two met after Ms. Chase wrote letters to inmates, persuading them to join the group with which she associated. The two corresponded for months, and in April 2001, Ms. Chase moved to Boston from Indiana.

The exhibition at Hofstra is the group's first in a museum. The mostly volunteer foundation, which has a Web host in the Netherlands and a Webmaster in Connecticut, charges no commissions on sales of participants' works that it helps arrange. Instead, it gets by on donations and grants. It has presented paintings, drawings and sculptures at the United Nations, Lilith Fair concerts and mental health conferences.

''Breaking the Walls of Bias'' was organized by Marcus Schubert, a photographer and sculptor who lives in Toronto. Mr. Schubert, who is also a curator of exhibitions by self-taught artists, said: ''I'm interested in the very personal point of view of this work, in the sense of discovery and reinvestment of feeling that it represents. It brings our attention back to the processes by which art is made and to why it's made.''

In the show, paintings by Lynn Schirmer of Seattle exude an intense emotion that interests Mr. Schubert. Even without knowing that Ms. Schirmer suffered incestuous abuse as a child and wrestles with dissociative identity disorder as a result, viewers may recognize the sense of fear and vulnerability that her work conveys. Ms. Schirmer depicts naked, contorted female figures, alone or huddling in groups. ''Closet Time'' (1995) is typical; it shows a young woman cowering in a dark, narrow chamber.

Referring to her paintings' fluid, fleshy forms and psychological edge, Ms. Schirmer said: ''As a child, when I produced images that alluded to what was really going on, I would be severely punished.

David C. Christman, the director of the Hofstra Museum, said his university became familiar with survivors' art when a conference on brain tumors was held on campus a few years ago. ''For that event, Candyce organized a show of art by survivors of this disease, and much of it was powerful and memorable,'' Mr. Christman said. More recently, in working with Ms. Brokaw to select pieces for the current exhibition, Mr. Christman said: ''We looked at each piece with a major criterion in mind. We asked: Is the work technically sound?''

Mr. Schubert said that the works in the show are technically proficient and ''aesthetically strong and mature.'' He added, ''This is not an outsider art show and should not be seen as such.'' Despite the deeply personal subjects of the pieces, the artists represented do not work in isolation and are not cut off from cultural influences, he said. Moreover, they regard themselves and wish to be recognized as artists.

Ms. Brokaw appeared to be proud of the respectful validation, as she put it, that a museum show has given her collaborators' efforts. ''Survivors who make art are coming to us from all over,'' she said. ''Making art is a great way to let your rage and pain out, which is harder when you're talking to a doctor.''

Ms. Brokaw added: ''This art really is our common language, and sadly, the need for it is probably not going to go away any time soon.''",nytimes.com,True

Re ''Officials Puzzled About Motive of Airport Gunman Who Killed 2'' (front page, July 6):

I am appalled that the F.B.I. feigns ignorance as to the motive of Hesham Mohamed Ali Hadayet in cruelly murdering two innocent people at the Los Angeles airport. A heavily armed Arab national marches directly to the Israeli airline's ticket counter and opens fire -- and we are wondering whether this is a hate crime, a terrorist attack or simply a random act of violence? Are the three really mutually exclusive?

Some may avoid labeling this a terrorist act so as to feel as though America got through Independence Day safely. Yet it is naïve to deny that Mr. Hadayet was most likely driven by a hatred for Israelis and pro-Israel America, a hatred shared with the Egyptians and Saudis who attacked us on Sept. 11. If the F.B.I. is unable to realize that this was a crime of hate committed by a terrorist, then our intelligence services are in need of far more than a cabinet reorganization.

Re ''Seeking Acceptance, After 5 Generations'' (letter, June 23):

A national survey bears out that Asian-Americans still feel the pain of prejudice. The study, commissioned in March 2001 by the Committee of 100, an organization of prominent Chinese-Americans, found that a significant minority of Americans, about 25 percent, held strong negative attitudes toward a stereotype of Chinese-Americans.

A third thought that they were more loyal to China than to the United States, while 46 percent thought that they could not be trusted not to pass on secret information to Beijing.

The suspicions and distrust that emerge provide fertile ground for the kind of racial excess that took the life of Vincent Chin 20 years ago (''A Slaying in 1982 Maintains Its Grip on Asian-Americans,'' front page, June 18). The survey also shows that although we may have come a long way in America, stereotypes and racial prejudice still exist in large numbers.

The new measure, which is expected to pass the upper chamber of Parliament easily, is meant to clamp down on such attacks. It defines the crime of extremism more fully, and sets out tougher punishments, including imprisonment, for those convicted of it. It also allows authorities to suspend organizations suspected of such activities, even before courts decide their guilt.

This is the part of the measure its critics find most objectionable. The authority to suspend organizations lies with the local police and prosecutors, two groups that are little trusted by ordinary Russians.

''This law will bring nothing good,'' said Lev Levinson, a legal expert at the Human Rights Institute, a group led by the human rights advocate Sergei Kovalyov. ''It puts all civil society under threat. The definition of extremist is too unclear. Are protesting mothers in Chechnya extremists?''

This year, remembrances like the one here -- which includes an all-day civil rights ''teach-in'' and a screening of the 1989 documentary ''Who Killed Vincent Chin?'' -- are planned in cities across the country, including New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia.

Organizers say the commemorations are especially important now, with anti-foreign sentiment running high after Sept. 11 and many United States citizens under suspicion because of their ethnicity. But for Asian-Americans the vigils also offer a chance for personal reflection.

''The tragedy marked our political coming of age,'' said Helen Zia, a writer who helped found American Citizens for Justice in response to the Chin killing. ''But we also need to consider where we go from here.''

The initial response to the death of Mr. Chin, in many ways, reflected the relative invisibility of Asian-Americans as a political force in 1982. Mr. Chin met his assailants, Ronald Ebens, a supervisor at Chrysler, and his stepson Michael Nitz, who had recently been laid off, at a strip club in Highland Park, a small blue-collar city surrounded by Detroit, where Mr. Chin was having his bachelor party.

A dispute started inside the club about a stripper. Then a dancer heard Mr. Ebens hurl profanities at Mr. Chin, blaming him for the loss of American jobs. Moments later, according to court documents, Mr. Ebens and Mr. Nitz chased Mr. Chin down the street and crushed his skull with a Louisville Slugger.

Asian-Americans called the killing a hate crime. But a judge ruled the death was no more than the tragic end to a barroom brawl. The two pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter, and as part of the plea agreement, were sentenced to three years of probation and $3,780 in fines and court fees.

The court's response to the death of Mr. Chin -- a 27-year-old industrial draftsman who was raised in Detroit and whose livelihood, like those of his killers, depended on the American auto industry -- set off shockwaves through Asian communities across the nation.

''It sent a chilling message that it didn't matter if you worked for American companies and spoke English without an accent, you still weren't regarded as a red-blooded American worthy of rights,'' said Frank Wu, a law professor at Howard University and author of ''Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White.''

Mr. Chin's mother, Lily Chin, had come to the United States from China after World War II to marry David Chin, a Chinese-American who fought for the United States during the war. Inspired by Mrs. Chin's grief and determination, the American Citizens for Justice took its message to the federal government.

Federal authorities prosecuted Mr. Ebens and Mr. Nitz on civil rights grounds, in the first such case involving an Asian-American victim, but ultimately lost in 1987.

The fact that many of those now committed to Mr. Chin's legacy were toddlers at the time of his killing is a sign both of progress and of continuing challenges.

Since Mr. Chin's death, the Asian-American community has grown substantially, both in sheer numbers and political influence. The population of Americans with Asian or Pacific Island heritage has increased roughly 70 percent in the last decade, to more than 12 million.

Asian-American advocacy groups have won significant political victories in the last two decades, from a 1988 law granting reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II to the expansion of mandates for bilingual voting materials in heavily Asian districts, as part of the Voting Rights Act of 1992.

As their political influence has increased, though, so have acts of prejudice and intimidation. Anti-Asian incidents -- from vandalism to murder -- ranged from 400 to 500 a year in the mid-1990's, according to the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, a Washington-based advocacy group.

The group received reports of nearly 250 ethnically motivated incidents in the three months following Sept. 11, most involving South Asians thought to be Arab.

Such tensions are emboldening a new generation of Asian-American advocates. This spring, Asian-American groups from several colleges organized a boycott of the clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch to protest a line of T-shirts with caricatured images of Asians and slogans like ''Wong Brothers Laundry Service: Two Wongs Can Make It White.''

Abercrombie & Fitch withdrew the line of T-shirts. A spokesman for the retailer apologized, saying, ''It's never been our intention to offend anyone.''

Ijun Lai, a University of Michigan senior, cannot watch the documentary about the Chin killing, which was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989, without crying. The fact that Mr. Chin was perceived to be a foreigner hits a nerve with her.

Raised in a predominantly white suburb of Chicago, Ms. Lai, 20, hung out at shopping malls with friends of many ethnic groups and listened to the Smashing Pumpkins, Boyz II Men and Korean hip hop. Even so, she cringes when recalling one of her earliest memories of college -- a group of rowdy young men bowing and yelling ''welcome to America'' at her as she walked down the street.

Ms. Lai is now co-chairwoman of the university's United Asian American Organizations, an umbrella group of 26 student groups seeking to promote Asian-American issues.

For many Asian-American students, the popular notion of Asian-Americans as a ''model minority'' is as damaging as negative stereotypes of the past.

The concept of an inherently super-achieving group that churns out violin virtuosos, high-technology entrepreneurs and geniuses who blow the curve in physics classes, causes Cesar Herrera, whose parents emigrated from the Philippines when he was a toddler, to roll his eyes.

''It completely discounts diversity within our communities and the very real problems of many Asian-Americans who are poor and struggling,'' said Mr. Herrera, a 20-year-old University of Michigan student who grew up in working-class neighborhoods in Ohio and Michigan trying to steer clear of Asian street gangs.

Michelle Lin, co-chairwoman with Ms. Lai of Michigan's Asian-American student coalition, said ''It's like the administration actually uses the whole 'model minority' thing to keep from giving us resources.''

Ms. Lin, Mr. Herrera and Ms. Lai acknowledge that most Asian-American students on the Michigan campus are not as politicized as they are. When the Asian-American student group called a meeting to vote on a statement supporting the university's affirmative action programs, a heated debate broke out. The measure passed by only one vote.

But that kind of diversity is what they want other Americans to recognize. They call it part of the social and political legacy they have inherited from the death of Vincent Chin.

As the meeting for the Chin remembrance ended, one last issue remained. The final event is to be a march to Mr. Chin's gravesite, led by a group of drummers and students carrying banners. But the group's budget did not have enough money left to pay for the bold banners the students hoped to have made.

Mr. Brander managed to stumble to his feet and crawl out the door and about half a block away, where two men and a woman from an apartment across the street comforted him and cradled his head with a blue bath towel as he wondered why he had been shot.

Within minutes, an army of heavily armed police officers from the Emergency Service Unit descended on the corner, and more shots rang out from Bar Veloce. Two patrons, whom the police identified as Annie Hubbard and Ann Margaret Gidley, both young Manhattan residents, had jumped the gunman from behind and tried to subdue him, the police said. But Mr. Johnson, who was holding another woman, Robin Arzon, 20, by the hair, reached around and shot Ms. Hubbard in the right shin.

As the three struggled, police officers burst in. One officer from the Emergency Services Unit fired a single shot, grazing Mr. Johnson in the head and enabling the police to subdue him, the authorities said. He was charged with attempted murder and weapons possession. Other charges were pending, Commissioner Kelly said.

Mr. Brander, Ms. Hubbard and Mr. Iso were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center. Mr. Brander was in serious but stable condition last night. Ms. Hubbard and Mr. Iso were both in fair condition.

''It will be categorized as a bias crime, but this was such a bizarre event,'' Commissioner Kelly said. ''This individual was clearly deranged, possibly as a result of his wife having died.''

Other police officials said the woman, who was not identified, died of AIDS on March 4, leaving Mr. Johnson alone to raise their 10-year-old son in their apartment at 110 Humboldt Street in Williamsburg.

The shootings on a street crowded with Saturday night revelers were the latest in a series of high-profile crimes in downtown Manhattan that have served as a reminder of an earlier, more violent time in the city's history. On Wednesday, a prowler climbed into a window of an apartment building farther south, on the Lower East Side, and killed three people. And in April a Russian-born engineer was shot as he tried to resist a robbery attempt as he and a date walked around Greenwich Village. The police have arrested suspects in both of those cases.

Mr. Kelly stressed that crime in the area has dropped sharply, as it has throughout the city, and remains at low levels. And he said yesterday's shootings should not be considered typical street crime.

''I wouldn't characterize this as a crime,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''This is some bizarre event, or I think it would be fair to hypothesize that this individual wanted to be killed. Either he was going to die in a fire or the police were going to kill him.''

Inside Bar Veloce, some people escaped out a rear entrance, the police said. One man who was inside the bar said about a dozen other people escaped into the basement, where they phoned the police, then broke a window and climbed out. About 15 people were left when the gunman started ordering a woman to tie plastic handcuffs around other hostages' wrists, said Reona Kimura, one of the hostages. The gunman had apparently brought the plastic cuffs with him.

She said she had been having a drink at the bar when Mr. Brander ran in and exclaimed, ''I got shot.'' He was trailed by the gunman, who ordered everyone into the kitchen and sprayed flammable liquid on them. ''He said he wanted to blow us up,'' Ms. Kimura, 30, of Brooklyn, said, ''He was angry at white people.''

In one conversation with a police operator, Mr. Johnson warned that the people inside were wearing ''gasoline shirts'' and threatened to torch them, Mr. Kelly said.

Many witnesses who described the 45-minute siege told of at least nine shots being fired as people ducked and shrieked in fright.

When it was over, the police said, they found Mr. Johnson, wearing elbow pads and knee pads and in possession of the semiautomatic handgun, a .22-caliber Ruger pistol, a two-shot Derringer, a sword with Asian characters on its blade, plastic handcuffs, 153 rounds of ammunition and cassette tapes labeled ''My own thoughts.''

''I've never heard of anything like this happening,'' said Louise Pfister, 58, who owns eight buildings in the area.

The police said that Mr. Johnson had a criminal record dating from 1985, and had been arrested at least three times in the last nine years.

In 1993, he was arrested in North Carolina and charged with carrying a concealed weapon; two years later, he was arrested in Brooklyn and charged with the illegal possession of a firearm; and in 1999, he was arrested in Orange County, Florida, and charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, the police said.

Investigators who searched Mr. Johnson's home at 110 Humboldt Street found pictures of guns and a note scrawled on the wall: ''Tell the boys in blue I won't be easy,'' the police said.

The move came after six Republicans who had previously voted for the measure refused to vote to limit debate on it.

Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, withdrew the bill after getting only 55 of the required 60 senators to vote for limiting debate, or cloture, though he said he would try again this year.

The measure's first Republican sponsor, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, was one of the six Republicans who voted for the bill in 2000 but opposed cloture today. Mr. Specter said his vote was cast to defend the minority's right to debate and offer amendments to the bill.

City of St. Paul.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The attorneys general of Arizona, California, Georgia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Oklahoma, Utah and Washington all signed a brief urging the justices to hear Virginia's appeal. ''Cross burning is an especially virulent, even unique, form of intimidation in American society'' that states should be able to prohibit, the brief said.

One reason for the continuing confusion is a disagreement among judges and legal scholars over how to interpret the Supreme Court's last decision. The St. Paul ordinance that the court invalidated made it a crime to place a symbol, including a burning cross, ''which one knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.''

According to the court's majority opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, this description of the prohibited conduct amounted to ''content-based discrimination'' because it ruled symbolic speech in or out depending on the groups that the speech targeted.

The Virginia law, which was enacted in response to highly publicized Ku Klux Klan cross burnings in the late 1940's and early 1950's, does not refer to any particular group. The law provides that ''it shall be unlawful for any person or persons, with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons, to burn, or cause to be burned, a cross on the property of another, a highway or other public place.''

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In finding the law unconstitutional, the Virginia Supreme Court's majority said that despite the lack of reference to any specific target, the law was nonetheless ''analytically indistinguishable'' from the St. Paul ordinance. The Virginia law was in its own way just as selective, the state court said, because it proscribed not all intimidating expression but ''selectively chooses only cross burning because of its distinctive message.''

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Virginia's attorney general, Jerry W. Kilgore, said in the state's appeal, Virginia v. Black, No. 01-1107, that the law's sole focus on cross burning was justified by the sense of threat associated with the practice. Even a ''white, middle-class Protestant waking up at night to find a burning cross'' outside his home would feel more threatened than if he found ''say, a burning circle or square,'' Mr. Kilgore's brief said, adding: ''In the latter case, he may call the fire department. In the former, he will probably call the police.''

The three defendants, Barry E. Black, Richard J. Elliott and Jonathan O'Mara, are represented by a well-known First Amendment scholar, Rodney A. Smolla of the T.C. Williams School of Law at the University of Richmond, and by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and private lawyers. Urging the justices to reject the appeal, they said the Virginia Supreme Court ''conscientiously applied core First Amendment principles in unpalatable circumstances.''

There were these other developments at the court today:

Effective Counsel

Voting 8 to 1, the court overturned a federal appeals court's ruling that set aside the death sentence of a Tennessee man convicted of a double murder. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, had granted Gary B. Cone's petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that his lawyer's handling of the sentencing hearing was so deficient as to have violated the Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.

The lawyer, in whom mental illness was diagnosed and who later committed suicide, failed to present mitigating evidence to the jury and did not make a closing argument.

Writing for the court today, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said that under the circumstances, forgoing a closing argument could be seen as ''a tactical decision about which competent lawyers might disagree'' because it deprived the state's highly effective lead prosecutor of the chance to make a rebuttal argument in the moments before the jury retired for its deliberations.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Consequently, Chief Justice Rehnquist said, it was not unreasonable for Tennessee's appellate court to find no constitutional violation in the lawyer's performance.

The decision, Bell v. Cone, No. 01-400, was the latest of the Supreme Court's efforts to apply a 1996 federal law, Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which significantly circumscribed the jurisdiction of federal courts to review state court decisions through habeas corpus petitions.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Under the law, federal courts may not grant petitions unless the state court proceedings ''resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law'' as defined by the Supreme Court's precedents.

The dispute in this case centered on which of two competing Supreme Court precedents on the effective assistance of counsel, issued on the same day in 1984, properly applied to the circumstances of Mr. Cone's sentencing. The Sixth Circuit applied one precedent, United States v. Cronic, which is favorable to defendants and creates a presumption that a lawyer who ''entirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing'' has been ineffective. In a dissenting opinion today, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the appeals court had properly applied the Cronic precedent to rule in Mr. Cone's favor.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But the majority said the Tennessee appeals court had been correct to apply the other precedent, Strickland v. Washington, which is much less favorable to defendants and requires proof not only that a lawyer's performance ''fell below an objective standard of reasonableness'' but also that the outcome would otherwise have been different.

While considering the Cone case, the justices have deferred action in a death penalty case from Texas that raises a similar analytical issue. In this case, Cockrell v. Burdine, No. 01-495, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit overturned the death sentence for a man, Calvin J. Burdine, whose lawyer slept through parts of his trial. The Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, held that ineffectiveness should be presumed under the Cronic precedent. The justices are likely to act shortly on the appeal filed by the Texas attorney general, John Cornyn.

Conspiracy Law

The court accepted an appeal from the federal government and agreed to decide an important question of the law of criminal conspiracies: whether a conspiracy should be deemed to have ended when the government frustrates its objective. As in this case, United States v. Recio, No. 01-1184, the question typically arises when the government has intercepted a shipment of drugs and has arrested the courier, unbeknown to the other members of the conspiracy, who continue with their activities even though they can no longer accomplish their goal.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, applying a doctrine it developed in the late 1990's that a conspiracy must be deemed to have terminated when its objectives have become impossible, overturned a drug conspiracy conviction of two men who arrived at an Idaho shopping mall to claim a drug shipment that the government had already intercepted.

In its Supreme Court appeal, the government argued that the Ninth Circuit's approach, with which other appeals courts disagree, would discourage ''legitimate law enforcement methods that can be of vital importance not only in drug cases, but also in violent crime, terrorism and other contexts in which prosecution of the conspirators and frustration of their goals are both crucial objectives.''",nytimes.com,True
https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/23/opinion/belated-justice-in-birmingham.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"With yesterday's conviction of Bobby Frank Cherry, 71, for his role in the 1963 bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, an Alabama jury wrote the final page of one of the most heart-rending chapters in the United States' civil rights history. In a year when Gov. George Wallace stood in a schoolhouse door and Eugene (Bull) Connor sicced dogs on peaceful protesters, the bombing was the Ku Klux Klan's answer to court-ordered school desegregation. Timed for a Sunday morning, when the church would be teeming with worshipers, the explosion left four young black girls dead.

Birmingham united in its grief. Whites and blacks turned out to hear Martin Luther King Jr. eulogize the four: Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Addie Mae Collins. But justice came slowly. It was not until 1977 that an Alabama court convicted Robert Chambliss on murder charges. Thomas Blanton Jr. was found guilty only last year. With Herman Frank Cash having died in 1994, Mr. Cherry was the only one of the four main suspects still at liberty.

It is gratifying that Alabama, which once heartily cheered Governor Wallace's vow of ''Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!'' has convicted the last of the 16th Street Baptist Church killers. And it is poignant, for those who remember Jim Crow, that the verdict was delivered by a jury of nine whites and three blacks.

Still, it is hard not to feel that justice was denied by being so long delayed. The elderly Mr. Cherry may be going to jail now, but his imprisonment comes after decades of undeserved freedom.

The Sunday school lesson at 16th Street Baptist the day of the bombing was ''The Love That Forgives.'' The congregation had no idea how cruelly it was about to be tested on that score. Now, though, with the last of the killers finally brought to justice, that noble ideal may be more nearly within reach.",nytimes.com,True

This was a historic crime, but one that did exactly the opposite of what the bombers had hoped it would do. Instead of forcing black leaders, through pure terror, to beg for segregation, it shamed and sickened white citizens. ''This tragic event may cause the white South to come to terms with its conscience,'' the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. predicted at the little girls' funeral.

The South did change, but the killers of the girls hid for decades inside a brittle silence that cracked only when they boasted of their involvement in a moment of indiscretion with kin and people they believed held the same hatred. It was largely that boasting, recounted by witnesses, that convicted them all.

Judge James Garrett had warned the audience in this courtroom, a cold, modern, prefabricated building barely large enough to hold the crowd, that he would lock up anyone who exhibited ''an emotional outcry.'' But as the forewoman read the verdicts, not by each victim's name but by a sterile case number, some black members of the audience began to cry and to mouth words of faith quietly. ''Praise God, praise God,'' said one woman, in the sixth row. ''Thank you, Jesus.''

Just one row behind her, Mr. Cherry's 20-year-old grandson, Glenn Belcher, cried with his hands around his head. Myrtle Cherry, Mr. Cherry's wife, held him with one arm across his shoulders.

Each guilty verdict carries an automatic life sentence, under the state law in place at the time of the bombing on Sept. 15, 1963. The murder convictions carry an automatic appeal, which will be handled by the state attorney general, but prosecutors said today that they were ''in good shape'' for any appeal.

''Thank God, today you can say Birmingham is rising out of the dust,'' said the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, who was beaten in 1957 by Mr. Cherry with brass knuckles when he tried to enroll his own children in an all-white Birmingham school.

Mr. Cherry's conviction, after deliberations of more than six hours, brings to a close an often-flawed and often-abandoned investigation into the bombing, which -- despite gaps of decades in its progress -- has finally brought to justice all the men linked to the bombing who did not die before cases could be made.

Robert Chambliss, nicknamed ''Dynamite Bob'' for his links to so many of the more than 40 blasts that terrorized black citizens here in the civil rights era, was convicted in 1977, and died in prison. Herman Frank Cash, whose family ran a barbecue restaurant that became a hangout for Klansmen, died untried.

Thomas E. Blanton Jr., who once laughed with Mr. Cherry about the bombing on an F.B.I. surveillance tape, was convicted last year, and has also been sentenced to life in prison. He sits in solitary confinement, for his own protection, at St. Clair Correctional Facility. None of them ever broke under F.B.I. pressure to name the others, and none of them ever confessed.

Even as bailiffs took out their handcuffs, getting ready to take him away to begin serving his sentence, Mr. Cherry said he was innocent, said he was the victim of a campaign of lies. When Judge Garrett asked him if he had anything to say, he motioned to the prosecutors. ''This whole bunch have lied all through this thing,'' said Mr. Cherry, who was indicted two years ago after the case was reopened in the mid-1990's. ''I've told the truth. I don't know why I'm going to jail for nothing.''

Just feet away, the surviving family members of his victims, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sat in a single row of metal folding chairs, all dry-eyed, outwardly impassive. It was as if they were determined to send Bobby Frank Cherry into the bleakness of his future without letting him see even one more glimpse of the pain that he had caused. ''I didn't do anything,'' Mr. Cherry said, again. A bailiff locked a set of handcuffs on his wrists, with a loud, ratcheting sound. ''Good luck,'' Judge Garrett said.

Mr. Cherry vanished through a side door and, as far as many of his victims are concerned, into a dark place in history.

Outside the courtroom, Ms. Rudolph remembered wandering in the blackness of the church basement, bleeding from her eyes. The four girls' bodies lay unseen. ''I couldn't find my way,'' she said. For a lifetime, she waited for this day, when the last person linked to her sister's death would be swept up in the change Dr. King talked about. ''My mama always prayed,'' she said.

But it was better, for some of the relatives to think about the girls before they were broken and bleeding. Eunice Davis, the sister of Cynthia Wesley, thought back to when she and Cynthia would stuff twine through the neck of an RC Cola bottle, and call it a doll. Ms. Davis has decided not to hate Mr. Cherry. ''He just don't know better,'' she said.

Hours later, in the cool dark of the bar in The Tutwiler Hotel, the prosecution team sat alone in a quiet celebration. ''It is as complete and as satisfying as a human being could ever hope,'' said Doug Jones, the lead prosecutor, who skipped law school class to attend the trial of Mr. Chambliss in 1977. In closing arguments, prosecutors kept referring to a picture of 11-year-old Denise McNair clutching a pink-skinned, blond-haired doll.

''A picture of Denise, taken by her father, a snapshot of the reason she died,'' said Mr. Jones, referring to the mingling of the races that Mr. Cherry so despised. ''It is also an image of hope, a dream, if you will.''

It was what Dr. King, who would die from an assassin's bullet in Memphis, had hoped might come from the worst thing that had ever happened -- or ever would -- in that struggle. ''This afternoon, we gather in the quiet of this sanctuary to pay our last tribute of respect to these beautiful children of God,'' he said at their funeral. ''Now the curtain falls. They move through the exit. The drama of their earthly life comes to a close. These children, unoffending, innocent, and beautiful.''",nytimes.com,True

''He is a murderer who has lived among us, and it is time we held him accountable for this crime against humanity,'' said Doug Jones, the lead prosecutor.

In their closing arguments today, the prosecution and the defense led the jury back to the Birmingham of the past, to a city where citizens fought to preserve the doomed ideal of segregation with more than big talk and bumper stickers.

Confederate flags whipped from the antennas of 1957 Chevrolets and from the flagpoles of the blue-collar houses where foot soldiers in the Ku Klux Klan gathered at kitchen tables to stew and plot. Between the end of World War II and 1963, more than 40 bomb blasts shook Birmingham. Mobs attacked civil rights pioneers with brass knuckles, and white men, secure in the knowledge that they could get away with just about anything, pistol-whipped the black men who offended them by talking back.

The prosecution and defense agreed that it was a shameful place, but disagreed as to the part Bobby Frank Cherry played in that now-disgraced society. Did he, like most white Southerners then, merely march in step with all the rest of them, no better or no worse, or did his hatred make him special?

Mr. Johnson said the F.B.I., using flawed evidence, selected Mr. Cherry from thousands of like-minded suspects. He fit their profile of a racist, but a bomber?

''Well, look at all these racial slurs,'' said Mr. Johnson, mocking the investigators who pursued Mr. Cherry in the 1960's. ''This looks like an easy man to prosecute. He is the human equivalent of a cockroach.''

When the bomb exploded under stairs outside the 16th Street Baptist Church, just days after the court-ordered desegregation of Birmingham's schools, investigators focused on Mr. Cherry, Robert Chambliss, Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Herman Frank Cash. For almost 40 years, Mr. Johnson said, they never looked at anyone else, even though investigators could have ''just thrown a net'' and captured many men who had the same views and the same level of involvement as Mr. Cherry.

''Surely,'' Mr. Johnson told the jury, ''you are not going to let the state convict on guilt by association.'' He said it was disingenuous for the same state government that had once supported the racist views of so many of its citizens to now ''come here with this feel-good prosecution.'' Instead of proving that his client was a bomber, he said, the state had merely proved that he was a lot like everybody else.

But prosecutors, in their closing argument, said Mr. Cherry was not just one more face in the crowd -- or even just one more face covered by a hood. ''Most people stayed home,'' said Don Cochran, who gave the first part of the prosecution's closing argument. But Mr. Cherry, a demolitions expert in the Marines, ''knew how to make bombs,'' and, with the help of others, he put his plans into action.

In the late 1950's and 1960's, Mr. Cherry become one of a small, hard core of violent supremacists, prosecutors said. In 1957, as the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth tried to integrate a Birmingham school, Mr. Cherry joined a mob that attacked him on the street. Mr. Cherry used a set of brass knuckles to punch him in the head, prosecutors said. In 1961, they said, he used a pistol to bash the head of a black man who insulted him at a Birmingham restaurant.

He boasted of those things as an old man, even to the F.B.I. ''Bopped ol' Shuttlesworth in the head,'' he said to investigators. ''Split a nigger's head open,'' he said another time. The statute of limitations on those crimes has long run out.

In 1963, just days after traditionally white Birmingham schools were finally opened to black students, he began to plot the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, prosecutors said. ''My children will never go to school with niggers,'' Mr. Cherry once said.

Mr. Johnson said the state had produced no hard evidence linking Mr. Cherry to the bombing, only to the past.

But prosecutors refuted that. They tied him to the bombing through his own words, in which Mr. Cherry bragged to family members and others, over the years, Mr. Jones and Mr. Cochran said.

They linked him to the Modern Sign Company, where he met with Mr. Chambliss and Mr. Blanton on the Friday before the bombing. Investigators believe the bomb may have been assembled there.

In a June 28, 1964, F.B.I. tape of a conversation between Mr. Blanton and his wife, Jean, he told her that ''we were making the bomb'' at the sign company, just three blocks from the church, that Friday.

In an Oct. 9, 1963, statement to the F.B.I., signed by Mr. Cherry, he wrote that he was at the Modern Sign shop that night from about 5:30 until after midnight with Mr. Blanton and Mr. Chambliss.

Mr. Chambliss, who was known in Birmingham as Dynamite Bob because of his involvement in so many bombings, was convicted in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1977, and died in prison. Mr. Blanton was convicted in the bombing last year. Mr. Cash died untried.

Mr. Jones said that Mr. Cherry was not the kind of man who would be at the sign shop to make signs. ''He was a man of action,'' he said.

Prosecutors also attacked Mr. Cherry's alibis. During a 1997 interview with investigators, Mr. Cherry said he was at home the Saturday night the bomb was believed to have been planted at the church. He said he was watching wrestling on television and looking after his wife, Virginia, who was sick with cancer. There was no wrestling on Birmingham's television stations that night, and his wife's cancer was not diagnosed until 1965.",nytimes.com,True

Bobby Frank Cherry, who over his lawyers' objections was found competent to stand trial despite a diagnosis of dementia, did not take the stand in his own defense.

''We determined that putting Mr. Bobby Cherry on the stand was like dueling an unarmed man,'' said Mickey Johnson, the lead defense lawyer.

It took prosecutors a full week to present their case, based largely on circumstantial evidence, and the defense less than a day to present a handful of witnesses to rebut the prosecution's claims that Mr. Cherry was a mean-spirited racist who in 1963 waged war against integration.

''He told me he had no part in it,'' said Robert High, the minister of a small nondenominational church near Mr. Cherry's home in Mabank, Tex., ''and to this day I still don't believe he did.''

Mr. High, who was also a co-worker of Mr. Cherry's at a metal fabricating plant, said that he had heard Mr. Cherry use the racial slur nigger and that he had used that slur himself, as a younger man.

In 1997, Mr. High founded a church made up of whites, blacks and Hispanics -- a church that Mr. Cherry joined, attending two or three times a month. Mr. Cherry was courteous to blacks and ''fit right in,'' Mr. High said.

Prosecutors pointed out, in cross-examination, that 1997, the year Mr. Cherry joined the church, was also the year investigators reopened the inquiry into the bombing.

''Since 1997, he has more than demonstrated his friendliness to black people at the church?'' asked Doug Jones, the prosecutor. ''Made a point of slapping them on the back?''

One man in that cadre, Robert Chambliss, nicknamed Dynamite Bob, was convicted in 1977 of the bombing that killed Denise McNair, 11, and Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley and Carole Robertson, all 14. Thomas E. Blanton Jr., another, was convicted last year. A third suspect, Herman Frank Cash, has died.

Mr. Cherry is the last of the men the Federal Bureau of Investigation has labeled its primary suspects and has long been mentioned in the same breath as the three others.

But Mr. Johnson, Mr. Cherry's lawyer, called one witness to try to refute a long-held belief by investigators that Mr. Cherry was seen at the church the night before the bombing, and today called a witness who seemed to refute that Mr. Cherry was in that cadre of people or even in the Klan. It was not a strong refuting, since witness after witness has linked Mr. Cherry to those men.

But Bill Jackson, a white-haired barber who said he once thought about joining the Klan and associated with Klan members, said he never saw Mr. Cherry at a popular hangout for Klansmen or at an organizational meeting by a Klan splinter group.

Mr. Jackson, who still lives in the Birmingham area, said he had seen Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Blanton and others at the Modern Sign Shop, where the bombers were believed to have gathered before planting the bomb.

But he could not remember whether he saw them there on the Friday or Saturday before the Sunday bombing, when he went by to help print Klan literature -- and he did not recall having seen Mr. Cherry there at all.

Mr. Jackson said on the stand that he was a naturally helpful person and had gone to the sign shop to help print silk-screen copies of Confederate flags and other Klan materials to be passed out at demonstrations.

''I done anything they asked me to do,'' he said.

But he never actually joined the Klan, he said.

''I did have an interest,'' he said, and it was that interest that led him to an organizational meeting under the Cahaba River Bridge outside Birmingham. He did not see Mr. Cherry there, either, though prosecutors have said that Mr. Cherry belonged to that splinter group.

Mr. Jackson said he made up his mind the Klan was not for him.

''You get to talking to those people,'' Mr. Jackson said, ''you get the feeling you don't want to be a member.''",nytimes.com,True

In that statement, the man she identified was Bobby Frank Cherry.

''I did not make that claim,'' she said today. She said she did not know Mr. Cherry, and could not have identified him as one of the men F.B.I. agents said that she saw outside the church the night before the bombing, which killed four girls: Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Cynthia Wesley and Carole Robertson.

But F.B.I. agents have long said that information about that night -- as well as other information about the bombers -- came from interviews with Mrs. Cunningham and a niece, Elizabeth H. Cobb. Mrs. Cunningham routinely passed on to the F.B.I. information -- much of it from her sister, Mr. Chambliss's wife -- about civil rights-related violence in Birmingham. Mr. Chambliss's nickname at the time, Mrs. Cunningham said today, was Dynamite Bob.

Mrs. Cobb is now dead, leaving only Mrs. Cunningham to back up, or deny, the statement they are said to have made to the F.B.I. about whom they saw that night. That statement would lead to the F.B.I.'s focus on Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Cherry, Herman Frank Cash and Thomas E. Blanton Jr., Mr. Johnson said.

''Nothing else I've seen implicates Bobby Cherry except that story,'' he said. ''The suspect list never got down to the four you keep calling prime suspects until Dec. 7.''

The F.B.I., he said, continued to use that statement in court proceedings even after agents knew that it was untrue. In a move that had some people in the audience -- and apparently the jury, too -- more than a little confused, he then apparently impeached his own witness, Mrs. Cunningham, by calling to the stand a former state investigator who said that she told him in 1977 that she did know Mr. Cherry.

The investigator, Bob Eddy, who worked for the Alabama attorney general during the Chambliss trial, said Mrs. Cunningham never told him that the F.B.I. statement was wrongly attributed to her. She told him, Mr. Eddy said, that she made it up.

It seemed as if Mr. Johnson was trying to persuade the jury that, whether the statement was never made or was just made up, it should have never been a foundation for the case against his client. But state prosecutors said today that they did not use that statement in any way in building their case against Mr. Cherry, or in their prosecution of Mr. Blanton last year on the same charges.

Mr. Blanton is serving a life term. By the time Mrs. Cunningham's statement of Dec. 7, 1964, was recorded -- rightly or wrongly -- by the F.B.I., investigators had already interviewed Mr. Cherry several times, according to F.B.I. files. He was immediately a suspect, federal agents have said, because of his racist views and his Klan connections.

Over the years, investigators have determined that much of the information attributed to Mrs. Cunningham and Mrs. Cobb originated with other relatives -- like Mr. Chambliss's wife -- and trickled through the two women to the F.B.I.

Doug Jones, the lead prosecutor and a former United States attorney, said the only thing that really matters in this trial ''is the testimony in this courtroom before this jury.'' He has put on a parade of witnesses who spoke of Mr. Cherry's racist views and his boasts about his involvement in the crime.",nytimes.com,True

With Mrs. Rudolph's account here today of the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, prosecutors rested their case in the state murder trial of Bobby Frank Cherry, the 71-year-old white supremacist who is believed to be the last living suspect in a historic act of evil.

When she could finally see again, after the operations and the bandages and the loss of her right eye, Mrs. Rudolph could see that it was the simple act of washing her hands that spared her and that a few seconds later she would have been with her friends in front of that window, just feet from the bomb.

''Glass went in my eyes,'' Mrs. Rudolph said, as prosecutors showed the jury a picture of her in the hospital then, her eyes covered with white bandages. But the few feet between where she stood and her friends was the bridge between life and death.

As she spoke, a gray-haired woman in the jury box tried not to cry. Her bottom lip trembled.

Mrs. Rudolph did not cry. She walked back to her chair, sat down and folded her arms, and began to wait -- as she has waited for 38 years -- for a little more justice in a case that began back when a young, wavy-haired man named Bobby Frank Cherry first became one of the F.B.I.'s prime suspects in an investigation that sputtered and stumbled across four decades.

Just a few hours before, another prosecution witness had described a slightly older Mr. Cherry, a man who had left the Klan behind in Alabama in the 1970's and moved to Texas to open a carpet cleaning business -- and brag to relatives about the day in Alabama that he struck a historic blow for white supremacy.

Teresa Francesca Stacy, Mr. Cherry's granddaughter, told the jury that she heard her grandfather boast of the bombing on the front porch of his trailer in East Texas.

''He said he helped blow up a bunch of niggers back in Birmingham,'' said Ms. Stacy, who was about 10 at the time.

''He seemed rather jovial,'' as he said it, she said.

She said she only heard Mr. Cherry say that once, but had heard other relatives say that he had told them that same thing several times. ''I've heard it for years,'' she said.

In 1997, she saw her grandfather in a television press conference. He denied any role in the bombing.

''I knew he was lying,'' Ms. Stacy said. ''I called the news people. They put me on hold for a long time. I hung up the phone and called the F.B.I.''

Mickey Johnson, Mr. Cherry's defense lawyer, then began chipping away at Ms. Stacy's credibility by asking her questions about her motive for her testimony and her past.

He asked Ms. Stacy if the attention from the case, including articles in Glamour magazine and Texas Monthly and an appearance on ''Good Morning America,'' had ''changed your life.''

He suggested that she had offered her testimony in return for a deal from prosecutors to reduce the sentence of her brother, who is serving a prison term in Texas for robbery and burglary.

''Well, I figured I shouldn't be dragged through the mud for nothing,'' she said.

Mr. Johnson, over the objections of prosecutors but with the blessing of Judge James Garrett, then asked Ms. Stacy about her addictions to drugs and alcohol.

She told him that she had been addicted to drugs when she was 12, and was in a rehabilitation at age 13.

''My drug of choice was cocaine,'' she said.

She said she is also a recovering alcoholic who drinks socially.

Ms. Stacy was not the first relative to say in this trial that Mr. Cherry boasted about the killings.

Willadean Brogdon, a still angry former wife who was married to Mr. Cherry from 1970 until their divorce in 1973, testified on Thursday that she had heard him brag about the bombing and that he told her he was the man who actually planted the bomb underneath a church stairwell the night before the explosion.

Officially, Mr. Cherry has repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with that bombing and told investigators in 1997 that he could not have been involved in making or planting the bomb on the night of Saturday, Sept. 14, 1963, the night investigators have long believed the bomb was placed, because he was at home with his wife, who was ill with cancer.

Mr. Cherry told investigators he went home to be with her and to watch wrestling. Later, in an interview with Jerry Mitchell of The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., he said he always watched wrestling on Saturday nights.

Mr. Mitchell, in a search of television logs, found that there was no wrestling on television that night.

Because there has been no forensic evidence linking him to the blast, prosecutors have tried to build a case of circumstantial evidence heavy with testimony about Mr. Cherry's hatred of blacks and his desire to keep them from mixing with whites in the Birmingham of the 1960's.

Bob Herren, an F.B.I. agent who interviewed Mr. Cherry in Texas in 1997, said Mr. Cherry told him that, in 1957, he used a pair of brass knuckles to punch the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth. ''Bopped Shuttlesworth between the eyes,'' Mr. Cherry told him, Mr. Herren testified.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Fred Shuttlesworth would go on to become a civil rights hero in Birmingham.

Mr. Herren said Mr. Cherry told him the Ku Klux Klan never would have blown up a church, because the Klan was a religious organization itself.

''He told me he sang in the Klan choir at churches and funerals,'' Mr. Herren said.

Mr. Herren said Mr. Cherry also told him he had joined the Klan because he wanted to work on political campaigns and ''wanted to chase women when he went to Klan rallies.''

Day after day, prosecution witnesses have described a much different Birmingham from the one that exists today, a city where blacks and whites mix and mingle in restaurants and office buildings. The ''whites only'' signs are long gone. But it was a different place the day that Chris McNair, Denise's father, remembered from the witness stand here today. ''Too vividly,'' he said.

He had gone to a different church that day, on Birmingham's Southside. He remembers hearing a faraway boom. He turned to his brother and asked: ''Is that thunder?''

As he spoke about the death of his daughter, in what some people saw as a war by some whites against blacks, prosecutors showed the jury a picture of Denise holding her favorite doll. It has pink skin and blonde hair.

Michael Wayne Goings, a house painter who worked with Mr. Cherry in Dallas in 1982, said he also heard him boast about the crime. ''You know, I bombed that church,'' Cherry told him, Mr. Goings testified.

But it was Ms. Brogdon who gave the most withering -- if disputed -- testimony. Ms. Brogdon, a former truck driver who said she quit her job after Mr. Cherry told her that ''only whores drove trucks,'' did not try to conceal an obvious, long-running contempt for her ex-husband. Once, on a trip through Alabama in the early 1970's with Mr. Cherry and her five children from a previous marriage, she decided that her marriage to him was not working. They made a brief stop in Mount Olive.

''When Bobby stepped out of the car, I laid my foot on the gas and drove,'' said Ms. Brogdon, a confident-sounding, gray-haired woman who came forward to testify against Mr. Cherry when she read in a newspaper about his trial.

Mickey Johnson, Mr. Cherry's lawyer, hammered at her credibility by pointing out small discrepancies between her testimony to a grand jury and her trial testimony, like her uncertainty over dates of events she remembered. At one point, tired of repeating things over and over for Mr. Johnson, she snapped at the defense lawyer, ''You should write some of this down.''

But while that drew laughter in the courtroom and even smiles from some of the relatives of the slain girls, much of her testimony was chilling.

Mr. Cherry, who was a truck driver himself, met her at a truck stop in Indiana in the fall of 1969, six years after the bombing.

She described a man who was proud of his association in one of the most violent klaverns of the Ku Klux Klan in a city that rocked from racial violence, who liked to model his white robe for her and her children.

''He'd put it on and danced all around, to show what he looked like as a Klan person,'' she testified.

Once, when their car broke down near the 16th Street Baptist Church in the early 1970's, he pointed to concrete steps at the church and said that was where he put the bomb the night before the blast, she testified.

Forensic experts have said that the bomb was placed under the stairwell.

''He said he lit the fuse,'' Ms. Brogdon said.

Mr. Johnson attacked her testimony then, saying it was impossible for Mr. Cherry to have planted the bomb hours before the blast and light its fuse.

But Ms. Brogdon said he placed the bomb the night before and came back later to light the fuse.

That would explain, bomb experts have said, why they never found pieces of a timing device -- like a clock or egg timer -- in the wreckage of the church.

Later, when he would talk about the bombing, his eyes would fill with tears, she said. But he would often follow up his bout of emotion with a racial slur, she said.

Her testimony also linked Mr. Cherry to two other bombing suspects -- Robert Chambliss, who was convicted in the murders in 1977 and died in prison, and Thomas E. Blanton Jr., who was convicted in the bombing last year.

''Bobby said Robert was the best bomb maker in that part of the country,'' said Ms. Brogdon, referring to Mr. Chambliss.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

She testified that Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Blanton and her husband ''were all together the night the bomb was built.''

She said she even had a tape recording of Mr. Cherry talking about his role in the bombing. She said she recorded it by accident, after a disagreement she had in the early 1970's with her then-husband about whether or not he snored.

She taped him sleeping, and he talked in his sleep about the bombing, Ms. Brogdon said.

She remembered it, in part, because when she was playing it back, it frightened the cat.

''The cat jumped straight up in the air and run off,'' she said. ''The cat couldn't take snoring on both sides of the bed.''

That tape was later consumed in a house fire, she said.

In cross-examination, Mr. Johnson attacked her credibility through her own past. He asked her about a custody incident in Virginia in which Ms. Brogdon was charged with kidnapping her own children, whom she had left with her sister. After hearing that a judge there had given custody of the children to her sister, Ms. Brogdon said she loaded them in her car and took them back to Alabama. Ms. Brogdon said she had been ill during that time.

One reason she married Mr. Cherry, she said, was because a judge had instructed her to get married and build a stable life if she wanted her children back. ''And I cared for him,'' she said.

Other relatives told the jury that Mr. Cherry boasted of the bombing. Ms. Brogdon's brother, Charles Wayne Brogdon, said Mr. Cherry once told him that he helped make a bomb that was used on ''four kids and a church house.'' He said Mr. Cherry told him that the bomb was not supposed to kill anyone.

After Mr. Cherry left Birmingham for Texas, he continued to brag, one witness said. ''He said he had to get out of Birmingham because blacks were taking over,'' said Mr. Goings, the house painter.

He said Mr. Cherry was a carpet cleaner in apartments where he was painting, and he heard him admit to the bombing one day when Mr. Goings's mother was in the room.

But while many people here viewed the arrest as vindication, for some it has also become a chance for Martinsville to look at itself for what it has been -- a place, like many others, where racial hatred existed for generations, and where a legacy of intolerance still lingers -- and to move beyond its resentments.

In his sermon on Sunday, the Rev. J. Christy Wareham, the minister at the First Presbyterian Church, told a parable of a village that outsiders saw as a place that ''hates people because of the color of their skin.'' The hearts of outsiders had become hardened toward what they thought of as the killer village, he said, and the hearts of the villagers had subsequently become hardened about other people.

''Truth became impossible,'' Mr. Wareham said.

One of the truths that no one talked about was that even though they did not know her killer, there were some people who felt guilty about Carol Jenkins's murder.

In 1968 there were people in this town who hated black people, Mrs. Land, an accountant and mother of two, wrote. ''If you weren't one of them, then you knew someone who was. It might have been a neighbor, or it might have been your grandpa, or your Uncle Bob.''

''I've also lived with the fear that I could have known the person who so brutally killed Carol Jenkins,'' she wrote in the letter, which has not been published.

''But I dare say, in 1968, most people who lived here could have come up with someone they knew who might have had that kind of anger or rage to do something so despicable.''

''My grandpa was a bigot,'' Mrs. Land said in an interview. He had a terrible temper, she said. ''What if it had been my grandpa?''

But she is not a bigot, she wrote in her letter, and she has resented being labeled one all these years, ''just because I was born here.'' Mrs. Land talked about many of these things at Tuesday's Rotary luncheon at the First Presbyterian Church. She was given an ovation.

In the 1920's, Indiana was a Ku Klux Klan stronghold, and at its peak Klan-endorsed politicians ran the state. In 1925, there were 1,600 Klan members in Morgan County -- there are no separate numbers for Martinsville, the county seat -- or about 27 percent of the county's native adult white males.

''Martinsville in the 1920's was no more or less a hotbed of the Klan than any other Indiana town,'' said James H. Madison, a professor of history at Indiana University at Bloomington, and the author of ''A Lynching in the Heartland: Race and Memory in America,'' about the 1930 lynching of two black men in Marion, Ind.

The Klan's influence in the state fell sharply by the late 1920's, and by 1967, when the Klan arrived in Martinsville as the culmination of a multicity march, the mayor, James Gardner, urged the residents to ''disregard and ignore'' them.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Today, Professor Madison said, there is no evidence that Martinsville is a dangerous place for blacks. What matters, he said, ''is that people think it is.''

One of the town's newer residents, Dianna Griggs, 42, an internist who is black, recalled that years ago she had been ''literally afraid to stop in Martinsville.'' She arrived in the late 1980's after her husband, who is a pathologist, and is white, got a job at the county hospital. The town could not have been more welcoming, said Dr. Griggs, who is a member of the Martinsville women's club.

''Any time we go anywhere outside of Martinsville, and people find out where we're from, they're amazed we call this home,'' she said. ''They expect to hear reports of intolerance and prejudice.''

Still, in terms of many of its attitudes, as well as its composition, Professor Madison said, Martinsville, an overwhelmingly Republican, conservative Christian town, has not changed as rapidly as most small to medium-size towns in Indiana. One reason, he suggested, could be that the conclusions outsiders drew about the Carol Jenkins murder led some residents ''to sort of dig in, to draw a line.''

Whatever happened over the years -- whether it was a hard-fought high school basketball game where a handful of Martinsville fans were accused of yelling racial taunts at opposing black players, or a city official ranting about Middle Easterners and gays in a letter to the editor of the local paper -- outsiders seized upon it as yet another example of Martinsville's entrenched racism. For many townspeople, the incidents were further proof of how unjustly judged they were.

''No matter where we go,'' said Bette Nunn, 70, the managing editor of The Reporter-Times, where she has worked for nearly 40 years, ''people look at you -- especially if they have black people in their community -- as 'You're one of those mean people, one of those bad people.' ''

Four years ago, Mr. Wareham, a relative newcomer from Los Angeles, formed Pride -- People Respecting Individuality and Diversity in Everyone -- whose 25 members try to promote tolerance and to improve the town's image. Every year the group holds a dinner in honor of Albert Merritt, a black man who established a club for poor boys in Martinsville in the early part of the century.

Pride, whose members include a judge, a retired reading teacher and a doctor's wife, is hardly a bunch of rabble-rousers, but still it has stirred resentments. Like a lot of other people in town, the mayor says Pride spends too much time apologizing for things that have never happened.

Last fall Martinsville was back in the news after the assistant police chief, Dennis Nail, wrote a letter to the local paper complaining about ''queers,'' ''Billy Buddha,'' ''Hadji Hindu'' and the outlawing of organized school prayer.

Neither the mayor nor the police chief disciplined Mr. Nail or publicly criticized his letter, which he had written as a private citizen. Mr. Nail was given a standing ovation at a packed City Council meeting.

In the fall of 2000, the Indiana State Police, with help from Martinsville police, began reinvestigating the Carol Jenkins murder. There had never been a coverup of the case they said, only a lack of evidence. Officials arrested Kenneth Richmond last week at a nursing home in Indianapolis, after his daughter, Shirley McQueen, 40, came forward and said that she had been in the back seat the night her father drove to Martinsville with another passenger, a white man whom she could not identify.

She told the police that she had watched as her father spotted a black woman walking down the sidewalk, got out of the car and chased her down. The other man grabbed the black woman from behind, and her father stabbed her in the chest with a screwdriver, his daughter said.

When they got back in the car, her father and the other man were laughing. ''She got what they deserved,'' she quoted them as saying.

Mr. Richmond pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, and is being held without bond.

It is too soon to tell when Mr. Richmond, who has a long psychiatric history, will be brought to trial. No one here thinks that the history of the town that was written after the murder can be erased overnight. ''We are not at the end of the road, but at the fork in the road,'' Mr. Wareham said in his sermon.

But the minister said he thought the mayor had made a hopeful beginning at last week's news conference. The mayor had made a point of saying that, more than anything, he was happy for Carol Jenkins's family, which, had suffered for so long.

He told her stepfather, Paul Davis, who had raised Carol as his own daughter, and who was at the news conference, to call him at home if he needed anything.

But prosecutors are hoping that Mr. Burns, a former meat packing plant worker and truck driver, will provide the jury with a link between Mr. Cherry and two bombers who have already been convicted in this case, and show that the defendant was the kind of man who could set a bomb under a church full of people, kill four girls, and then joke about it.

Mr. Burns testified that, in the Birmingham of the 1960's, there were a lot of people who considered themselves Klansmen. But he was the real thing, going to meetings and everything, until an encounter with an F.B.I. agent in the weeks after the bombing changed his mind.

''They showed me the pictures of four pretty little girls,'' Mr. Burns said. ''They were very mangled. It was sickening to look at.''

He went, he said, from being a man who was harassed by the F.B.I. for his Klan ties and views to a man who befriended Klansmen and secretly taped their conversations to turn over to federal agents.

F.B.I. agents had rigged Mr. Burns's car with the recording device that night, and over the rush of wind in the windows, the sounds of the motor and traffic and other noise caught the exchange on tape.

It is hard to tell who was saying what, whether it was Mr. Blanton or Mr. Cherry, but the men joked about being asked: ''Where were you when the church blew up,'' one man said.

''It wasn't us,'' said one man, perhaps the same one. ''We were trying to get ours ready for the weekend.'' That was followed by peals of laughter.

The tape, played for the jury here today, also has segments in which the men in the car discussed alarm clocks as a means to detonate a bomb and batteries as a power source for detonators.

They also mentioned Troy Ingram, who has been identified in F.B.I. and state investigations as a suspected builder of the bomb. He died before Robert Chambliss, the first of the primary suspects to be tried, was convicted in 1977. Herman Frank Cash, another suspect, has also died.

Mr. Johnson hammered at Mr. Burns in cross examination, saying that the government was paying him to get drunk and flirt with women. He chided Mr. Burns for being able to remember a sentence spoken almost 40 years ago but not remembering how much the F.B.I. paid him as an informer. Today, he said it was $60 a month. The lawyer pointed out that Mr. Burns said in earlier testimony that he was paid $200.

The blast, the most horrific of a series of bombings that shook this city in the 1950's and early 1960's, came just five days after the integration of the city's school system.

Forensic experts called by the prosecution said they found no timing device in the rubble -- a key piece of evidence, because the bomb was believed to have been placed under a church stairwell and not thrown from a moving car.

The experts, including an F.B.I. bomb expert, said the timing device could have been vaporized by the blast, which was strong enough to crater the church basement, crush brick and twist iron reinforcing bars.

Lawyers for Mr. Cherry, who is expected to be the last man tried in the historic, flawed, four-decade investigation into the civil rights era crime, said they did not question the wrongness of the act or the racial attitudes of the era.

But prosecutors are trying, through the defendant's past, to falsely insert Mr. Cherry's hands into ''blank fingerprints,'' said Mickey Johnson, one of Mr. Cherry's defense lawyers.

''In 1963, in Birmingham, the people whose fingerprints would have fit into those blanks numbered in the hundreds if not thousands,'' Mr. Johnson said.

There were countless people whose racist attitudes would have made them suspects, defense lawyers said. Mr. Cherry, the last of the primary suspects in the bombing, has not been linked to the crime by even one piece of forensic evidence, Mr. Johnson said.

But prosecutors said they would tie him to that crime with other evidence, and put a man on the stand today who said he heard Mr. Cherry mention 16th Street Baptist Church and a bomb less than a week before the blast.

The man, Bobby Birdwell, a commercial plumber who grew up near Mr. Cherry's house in Ensley, just outside Birmingham, said he often played with Tommy Frank Cherry, Mr. Cherry's son. Mr. Birdwell testified that, in September 1963, he and Tommy Frank Cherry -- Mr. Birdwell called him Frank -- were playing in the neighborhood and decided to go into Bobby Frank Cherry's house to get some water. It was, Mr. Birdwell said, just four or five days before the bombing.

''We went through the living room,'' Mr. Birdwell recalled. ''There was a robe on the couch. White robe. Cutouts in the eyes, and everything,'' he said. It was a Klansman's robe, Mr. Birdwell said.

''I asked Frank whose it was. He said, 'It's my daddy's,' '' Mr. Birdwell said.

The boys walked on through the house to get their water, and found Mr. Cherry and three other men sitting in the kitchen, talking. The men were talking about integration.

''I heard them mention a bomb, and 16th Street,'' Mr. Birdwell said. ''Well, me and Frank went out and played.'' He did not call the police. He was just a boy, he said, and he was frightened of what might happen if he told on Mr. Cherry.

Mr. Birdwell's own parents, like many people then, also opposed integration, he said. ''I was scared,'' he said. ''There was a lot going on back then, a lot of hatred.''

In 1997, he read an article in a Birmingham newspaper about Mr. Cherry and the church bombing. ''I called the F.B.I.,'' he said.

In cross-examination, Mr. Johnson attacked Mr. Birdwell's credibility. He asked Mr. Birdwell how often he drank, and Mr. Birdwell replied that he had an occasional beer.

He then asked Mr. Birdwell if an F.B.I. agent had asked in 1997 if he had a drinking problem, and if the agent had accused him of giving two versions of the story.

Mr. Birdwell said no, and Mr. Johnson -- without explaining where he was headed with that line of questioning -- asked and received permission from the judge, James Garrett, to recall Mr. Birdwell later.

It was the only testimony on the trial's opening day that linked, even circumstantially, Mr. Cherry with the actual bombing.

But prosecutors went on to try to link Mr. Cherry to other acts of racial violence, and used history to show the escalating tensions in the city at that time.

Trying to establish motive, they tried to place Mr. Cherry -- through an old film -- at the scene of a mob beating of a Birmingham civil rights hero as he tried, with his own children, to integrate a public school.

Jimmy Parker, a master technician and broadcast engineer, was a college student and cameraman in the late 1950's. A graduate of the school, Phillips High, he had gone back to get some grade transcripts so that he could apply to college. It was September 1957, and as he came out of the school, he testified, he saw a group of about 50 white people and ''four, five or six cops'' in a confrontation with the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, his wife and two children. Mr. Shuttlesworth was trying to enroll his children in that all-white school, and the mob attacked them.

''I noticed a ruckus going on,'' Mr. Parker said. ''I grabbed my camera, and shot some film.'' His film shows a man who prosecutors believe is a young Bobby Frank Cherry in that mob, and shows him reaching into his pocket for something -- ''a roll of quarters,'' Mr. Parker guessed -- and then swinging hard at Mr. Shuttlesworth.

''He swung, couldn't tell if he connected or not,'' Mr. Parker said.

The film showed the mob flailing at the smaller group of black people, including the children, as the police -- at least at first -- mostly let it happen. Prosecutors then froze the film on a shot of the man believed to be Mr. Cherry, a cigarette dangling from his lip.

On cross-examination, Mr. Johnson asked what Mr. Parker did with the film he shot. ''I sold it,'' he said. ''This looks like evidence of a crime,'' Mr. Johnson said. Why, he asked, did Mr. Parker not take the film to the police? Mr. Parker, straight-faced, told him there were several police watching it all happen. People in the courtroom politely chuckled.

Prosecutors seemed intent on showing how the events of the civil rights movement, and the mob violence and bombing that dogged it, led ultimately to the creation of people like Mr. Cherry and the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church.

Mr. Birdwell said he heard Mr. Cherry say his ''kids will never go to school'' with black children, using a racially offensive term.

Mr. Birdwell's testimony drew a glance from Mr. Cherry, who had mostly seemed uninterested in the proceedings, even as the mothers of two of the slain girls gave their emotional testimony. Mr. Cherry, who suffers, his lawyers say, from dementia, seemed alert as he moved around the courtroom, but sat stone-faced during the testimony. He had dozed off during jury selection.

The relatives of the bombing victims stared hard at him, with the exception of Mrs. Robertson, who refused to even look at him as she was wheeled through the courtroom.

Mr. Cherry, a truck driver who left Alabama for Texas in the 1970's, is expected to be the last man to stand trial in connection with the bombing. Robert Chambliss, an associate of his, was convicted in the bombing in 1977. He died in prison. Herman Frank Cash, another suspect, died untried. Thomas E. Blanton Jr. was convicted last year, in a crime that -- almost 40 years later -- still made people in the audience sob.

Finally, there comes the trial of Bobby Frank Cherry, now 71, the last of the primary suspects in the bomb blast that killed her teenage daughter and the three other girls, in the most shameful incident of the civil rights struggle.

''The last,'' she said, as a quick, humorless laugh rose in her throat. At least, she said, he is ''the last one they can get.''

State prosecutors and defense lawyers were expected to select a jury by Monday, and opening statements could begin as early as that afternoon in the murder trial of Mr. Cherry, a former truck driver and white supremacist, and a suspect for 38 years in the murders of Denise, 11, and of Carole, Cynthia and Addie Mae, all 14.

It is expected to be the final attempt by the State of Alabama to bring to justice a living suspect in that bombing and, in the process, cleanse itself of a stain on its history. But in the old black neighborhoods in a new-looking city of downtown skyscrapers and vast suburban sprawl, there is a sadness too severe, too profound, to correct with a courtroom, and a pain as new as yesterday.

''Closure? I have often wondered why they associate that word with this affair,'' Mrs. Robertson said. ''For those who are not involved, it is easy to say that.''

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Certainly, she said, ''justice is due.''

''Closure,'' she said, ''is just a word.''

It may also be the last trial, or certainly one of the last, of its kind, said experts on the civil rights movement, as well as people who lived it. Time is running out, for suspects, the witnesses, the surviving victims, everyone.

But few cases carry the historic or emotional charge of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. Alabama courts convicted Robert E. Chambliss, in 1977, and Thomas E. Blanton Jr., last year, on murder charges related to that crime. Another suspect, Herman Frank Cash, died in 1994.

While others may have been involved, in the crime or the cover-up, only Mr. Cherry remains of those linked by state and federal investigations to the actual design or placing of the bomb.

''They want to close it up with him,'' said Sarah Collins Rudolph, who lost an eye in the explosion that killed her sister, Addie Mae. ''Him, with one foot in the grave.''

That is not fair, she said, ''He's done lived.''

Mr. Cherry, who lived in Birmingham during the 1960's and left for Texas in the 1970's, has denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, that bombing, and his lawyers are expected to portray him as a feeble old man who suffers from dementia.

Family members have repeatedly sworn that he could never have done the thing he is accused of. But estranged relatives have said they heard him talk of his involvement in the bombing.

Prosecutors are expected to paint him, through the testimony of people who knew him in the summer of 1963 and the investigators who followed the case, as a man who believed that violence could keep blacks in their place in Birmingham, a man mean enough to bomb a church on a Sunday morning.

For many people here, the confrontation is not one of lawyers and judges and courtroom files.

It is a matter of good and evil, and heaven and hell.

As the decades slipped by, every day reminded older black people here of the deep hatreds that allowed the bombing to happen, the racial attitudes that devalued the lives of the four girls, and the investigations that were botched or delayed.

''The Bible says that in the last days, all this evil stuff will come out,'' Mrs. Rudolph said. ''They thought they had got away with it, but God will bring it out.''

What the jury decides, in this last case, does not matter so much. ''He's got to stand before the Lord,'' Mrs. Rudolph said. ''And he's going to lift up his eyes in hell.''

But there are few people here, especially among those touched most cruelly by the bombing, who believe Mr. Cherry should not be tried.

''Everybody will know what happened,'' said Eunice Davis, who is Cynthia's sister.

It will be part of history, say some older black people in Birmingham, not just something people here in Birmingham know, and have always known.

''Now they say he's got heart trouble and confused in his mind,'' Mrs. Davis said. ''Back then, we didn't go out at night'' because of the threat of the bombs and the men who set them.

The church, three months before the bombing, had been headquarters for the historic civil rights marches led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., making it a target.

The bomb, made from dynamite, exploded at 10:19 a.m.

''Boom,'' Mrs. Rudolph said, and then the glass and brick sang through the basement where she and the other girls had gathered. A piece of it stabbed her eye, and other pieces shredded her face and chest.

None of the girls who died had marched in Dr. King's now famous ''children's crusade.'' They were just at church.

From the start, powerful men derailed the investigation. Col. Albert J. Lingo, a George Wallace appointee, director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety and suspected Klan sympathizer, seemed obsessed with blaming black Muslims for the bombing.

Later, an F.B.I. memorandum in May 1965, addressed to J. Edgar Hoover, named the suspects. ''No avenue of investigation has been overlooked. As a result, it is apparent that the bombing was the handiwork of former Klansmen Robert E. Chambliss, Bobby Frank Cherry, Herman Frank Cash, Thomas E. Blanton.'' It went on to name a fifth suspect who was ''probably'' involved.

Saying that the chances for conviction were ''remote,'' Mr. Hoover ordered F.B.I. agents not to meet with state or federal prosecutors, not to share their findings. It would be years before anyone paid.

First, it was Mr. Chambliss, known as Dynamite Bob, a former member of the infamous Eastview 13 Klavern in Birmingham, a group believed to have been involved in practically every major incident of racial violence in Alabama from 1961 to 1965.

The investigation was built largely on the testimony of women who had been married to or otherwise related to the bombers, including one woman who heard Mr. Chambliss declare, ''Just wait till Sunday morning, and they will beg us to let them segregate.''

He was convicted in November 1977, by an Alabama attorney general named Bill Baxley who, as a law student at the time of the blast, had written the names of the four girls on a card in his wallet, so he would not forget them.

But even to shorten his life sentence, Mr. Chambliss would not inform on his friends, and he died in prison in 1985. When Mr. Cash died in 1994, it left only Bobby Frank Cherry and Thomas E. Blanton Jr.

Mr. Blanton was convicted in May of last year, on a combination of witness testimony -- much of it about his hatred of blacks -- and taped conversations in which he discussed how to make a bomb.

Mr. Cherry's case, too, is expected to be decided on mostly circumstantial evidence, and the jury's decision may come down to whose witnesses have the most impact, lawyers and legal experts say.

But in an emotional trial, legal experts point out, that could be enough to convict Mr. Cherry.

''I call them atonement trials,'' said Jack Davis, a professor who teaches on the civil rights movement at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Both prosecutors and defense lawyers are under orders not to discuss the case by the presiding judge, James Garrett of Jefferson County Circuit Court. But it would be wrong to say, said people here, that the city is abuzz over the trial. Many whites said they want to see justice done, some say they believe the old man should be left alone, and others say they want nothing to do with it -- that it is just one more reason to dig up the city's sometimes violent past.

Black people here, of course, tend to support the state's decision to try Mr. Cherry. But no one feels it, as Mrs. Robertson said, like the people who felt it firsthand.

Mrs. Rudolph is a housekeeper now, the sight in her one good eye slowly dimming. Recently, a doctor found a piece of glass in her stomach, and asked her how it got there. The doctor did not know she had been there, the day history was made. ''I can't feel it,'' she said, when asked if it hurt her.

A piece of glass is nothing. ''Some people,'' she said, ''have got demons in them.''

Re ''A Worthy Hate-Crimes Bill'' (editorial, May 3):

Sept. 11 was the ultimate hate crime directed against America. Congress, on the behalf of the American people, has an important responsibility to pass the strongest possible hate-crime prevention legislation this year. This will complement our war against terrorism and our quest for homeland security.

For too long, we have seen increases in hate crimes not accompanied by stronger law enforcement measures both to prosecute those responsible and to prevent future crimes. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, offered by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, would accomplish both directives. The commitment by Tom Daschle, the majority leader, to get the Senate to act on this bill is most welcome. Ultimately, the importance of the issue should transcend parochial partisanship of any kind.

The House and President Bush should also commit to this legislation.

''A Worthy Hate-Crimes Bill'' (editorial, May 3) misses the point. There should not be a separate category for hate crimes. A murder is a murder; a beating is a beating. As the editorial points out, several types of crimes do and should fall under the purview of the federal government. However, these are types of crimes, not motivation for crimes.

If we start to categorize crimes by their motivation, we start down a very slippery slope. We should prosecute people for the crimes they commit, not why they commit them.

In January ambassadors from 37 African countries signed a highly unusual joint appeal to the Foreign Ministry asking for more protection after a spate of attacks on their families and embassy workers.

The attackers are young people, often between the ages of 14 and 20, and often those who feel cast adrift in the economic collapse and social upheaval that followed the fall of the Soviet Union. Like skinhead groups across Europe, these teenagers turn their anger on people of color.

''The rank and file are youths with very few opportunities,'' said Boris Makarenko, deputy director of the Center for Political Technologies, a research group in Moscow. ''They are working-class youths with low levels of education.''

The attacks often appear to be organized; Mr. Gebre said many of his attackers were dressed in black with swastika insignias on their arms. And they have been common enough to hold many of Moscow's non-white communities in fear. In April two African-American marine guards from the American Embassy were attacked by skinheads in downtown Moscow.

Russian authorities have played down the problem, suggesting that the attacks are part of the growth in street crime, according to diplomats.

''The authorities are shying away from accepting the situation,'' said Nigeria's ambassador, Abdullahi S. Mukhtar. ''It has gone beyond the realm of threats -- it's a reality. People are being attacked; people are being killed. We made private appeals over the last couple of years and did not go public. But when you exhaust every avenue and hit a brick wall, what can you do?''

The police often react slowly, if at all, according to 13 attack victims interviewed over a two-week period.

One student from Cameroon, Ghislain Kokam, said two officers looked on while a crowd of at least 40 young people beat him for more than 10 minutes on a subway platform.

In another case, an attack was even captured on film. Joseph Peters, a 29-year-old refugee from Sudan, was carrying a video camera when he was attacked last June. He gave his videotape of the attack to the police, but after almost a year, the police said the tape did not work, though Mr. Peters had shown it to several friends, and, he said, to three police officers sent to question him.

The government does not keep statistics on hate crimes but the African ambassadors have counted 141 reported attacks since 2000.

President Putin's speech produced some interest in the issue, and extra police officers patrolled Moscow streets on April 20, the anniversary of Hitler's birth. The date has become a traditional day for racist attacks; on April 20, 2001, a mob killed a Chechen boy near the Kremlin.

But society as a whole has mustered little collective revulsion or sympathy. In part, this may be because life for many ordinary Russians is anything but easy. In addition, the war in Chechnya has engendered negative attitudes toward minorities, in particular Caucasians.

Now Congress has a chance to back up the president's promise by passing an important hate-crimes bill, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, which would expand the scope of the federal government to investigate and prosecute anyone who targets racial and religious minorities, gays, the disabled and other groups because of hate.

Under current law, the federal government can prosecute hate crimes only in cases where the victim was engaged in a federally protected activity, like voting, or if the crime occurred on federal property. The new bill would remove those limitations and allow federal investigators and prosecutors to pursue hate crimes wherever they occur, and under whatever circumstances.

Investigating and prosecuting crimes is generally a local matter, but not always. Congress has long recognized that the federal government should play a role in pursuing certain crimes, like bank robbery, kidnapping and racketeering, where the national interest is great and where federal law enforcement is in a good position to offer help to local police and prosecutors. Crimes in which individuals are singled out because of their race, religion or membership in other protected groups strike directly at this nation's commitment to equality, and are worthy of this sort of special federal involvement.

In addition to expanding the reach of federal law enforcement, the bill extends the reach of federal hate crimes to include actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender and disability, but only when the crime involves a violent act that results in death or bodily injury. Gays, in particular, are the third-largest hate-crime victim group, targets of more than 16 percent of all hate crimes in 2000, according to the F.B.I. Extending the law to protect all of these groups makes sense.

The Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, has promised that the bill, which has 51 Senate co-sponsors, will come up for a vote before summer. The Senate should offer its strong support. The bill is expected to have a harder time in the Republican-controlled House, but it should not. As President Bush reminded us last fall, hate crimes have no place in America today.

Mr. Rice, who was already serving an 11-year sentence for attacking a woman, implicated himself by statements that he ''hates gays'' and preys on women ''because they are more vulnerable than men.''

A year after the murders, Mr. Rice, of Columbia, Md., attacked a woman bicycling in the same park. He was arrested and pleaded guilty to attempted abduction in 1998, and was sent to the Petersburg Federal Penitentiary. Because the crimes took place in a federal jurisdiction, Mr. Ashcroft was able to invoke a provision that enhances sentencing for hate crimes, including those motivated by sex or sexual orientation.

Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, has introduced a bill that would increase the conditions under which the federal government could step in and prosecute hate crimes. Currently, federal hate crime charges cover only race, color, religion or national origin, and apply when the victim is engaged in federally protected activities like voting or going to school. Twenty-seven states have hate crime laws that include sexual orientation protections; an additional 16 states have hate crime laws that exclude it.

Senator Kennedy praised the Justice Department action today, but said the government needed additional tools to help the states.

If Ms. Williams and Ms. Winans ''had been murdered outside of Shenandoah National Park,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''the Justice Department would not be able to prosecute this case as a hate crime, and would be forced to remain on the sidelines in the fight against these senseless acts of hate and violence.''

He urged Mr. Ashcroft to support his bill, which would cover sex, sexual orientation and disability, or face criticism for an ''empty promise.''

Several Jewish targets were attacked late Wednesday. In Montpellier, in southern France, several gasoline bombs damaged an office building during the night between Wednesday and Thursday in what police said appeared to be a botched attempt to damage a Jewish community center in an apartment on the same street.

Despite the government pledge for more protection, the apartment was unguarded. The police said three people had been arrested and were being questioned.

Earlier on Wednesday, unidentified attackers set afire and destroyed a bus and car used to transport Jewish schoolchildren in the Paris suburb of Aubervilliers. That same day, the police had begun patrols at two Jewish schools and the synagogue in Aubervilliers, but officials said the police had been unaware of the existence of a parking lot near one of the schools where the bus and car had been left.

The government action to protect Jewish sites came after three synagogues in France were set on fire over the Passover-Easter weekend. In addition to an Orthodox synagogue in the southern port of Marseille, which was burned to the ground, synagogues in Strasbourg and in Lyon were also attacked.

Speaking earlier this week, Mr. Jospin pledged that the government would crack down firmly on any acts of anti-Semitism.

The government is also facing widening demonstrations by the Israeli and Palestinian sides. On Wednesday, several thousand people marched through the streets of Marseille, holding aloft pictures of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and denouncing Israel.

Similar demonstrations, attended by several thousand people, were organized in Paris on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Further demonstration by supporters of the Palestinians are planned for Saturday in Paris.

Earlier this week, the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions, the umbrella group of Jewish organizations in France, announced plans for a major demonstration this Sunday in central Paris that it said would be directed ''against anti-Semitic actions, against terrorism and for solidarity with the people of Israel.''

French newspapers said Jewish leaders were divided over the question of whether to make support for Israel a theme of the demonstration.

https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/30/opinion/the-cloning-conundrum.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Human cloning and hate crimes would seem to have little in common. But in a series of shortsighted decisions on the constitutional limits of Congressional power, the United States Supreme Court has managed to create legal precedents that may make it difficult for the federal government to ban cloning as well as hate crimes. This will no doubt come as a surprise to opponents of abortion, who oppose cloning on a moral basis and have been eager to outlaw it.

Since the New Deal, Congress has been free to regulate any activity so long as it had substantial effects on interstate commerce. In the last decade, however, the five-person conservative majority on the Rehnquist court has created a set of federalism doctrines forbidding Congress from regulating what the court calls ''noneconomic'' activities. In order to preserve the boundary between what is national and local, the court insists, Congress must keep its hands off ''traditional'' local subjects like crime and the family.

Thus in 1995 the court said that Congress could not prohibit guns in or near elementary and secondary schools, because this usurped local authority to make decisions about what activity should be made criminal. It also struck down a federal law that let women sue their attackers in federal court. Violence against women isn't economic, the court said; it's about crime and families. The new states' rights doctrines would also undermine any future Congressional effort to pass hate-crime legislation. Although hate crimes, like domestic violence, clearly have an economic impact, under the court's logic they are defined simply as assaults.

In 1994, many conservatives opposed the passage of the Violence Against Women Act because they said it infringed upon states' rights; today many make the same argument against federal efforts to outlaw other hate crimes or to regulate guns. They have cheered the Supreme Court's defense of state prerogatives. Now the tables are turned. Conservatives who decry the use of cloning to make humans want the federal government to make the practice criminal; last year, the House passed a ban on cloning for any reason, including for new medical therapies.",nytimes.com,True

Justice Minister Odd Einar Doerum said the number of hard-core, potentially violent racists is no more than 200 people in this nation of 4.5 million, but he acknowledged that Norwegians in general must overcome discriminatory attitudes born of Norway's remote location and relative lack of exposure to immigrants.

While Norway roundly condemns civil rights violations around the world and hands out the Nobel Peace Prize each year, it has fewer immigrants per capita than almost any other European nation. Still, the total has more than doubled since 1980 and now accounts for 5.5 percent of the country's population. That has been enough to cause conflicts in job and housing markets and to stoke fears that Norway's generous welfare system is being pillaged by outsiders.

The three defendants testified that they thought Norway should be reserved for white-skinned Norwegians. When they went out driving on the night of Jan. 26 it was so Mr. Jahr and Mr. Kvisler could ''get someone,'' Ms. Andreassen testified.

Shortly after 11:30 p.m. they spotted Mr. Hermansen and a friend, who had met briefly outside their apartment building to trade mobile phone covers and talk about school. The court concluded that it was Mr. Jahr who most likely delivered a fatal stab wound to Mr. Hermansen's heart after springing out of the car with a kitchen knife and chasing the boy over a fence. But the judges found that Mr. Kvisler took part in the chase and may have stabbed the victim in the back before Mr. Jahr reached him.

In any case, the judges said, Mr. Kvisler had egged Mr. Jahr on that night, and had also acted as his mentor in the violent underworld to which they belonged -- a world of ''white hate'' music, black boots, tattoos, shaven heads and decorations that include swastikas and the Confederate flag. Ms. Andreassen, for her part, had dabbled in ancient Norse religions, prompting the police to investigate the leader of an ''Odinist'' cult for possible incitement to violence.

Mr. Hermansen's friend, who was of Iranian descent, escaped the attack and testified against the attackers.

After the verdict was read, Mr. Kvisler appealed, while Mr. Jahr and Ms. Andreassen had not made a decision. The prosecutor, Berit Sagfossen, who had sought the maximum 21-year prison sentence for Mr. Jahr and Mr. Kvisler, did not announce her appeal plans. But Mrs. Hermansen, who was also awarded $37,275 in compensation from the three defendants, told reporters afterward that the sentences of 16 years for Mr. Jahr and 15 years for Mr. Kvisler -- of which only two thirds will probably be served in prison -- sent the wrong signal.

''The judges admit this was a racist killing, but that fact was not given any weight,'' said Mrs. Hermansen. ''Racism is there. We see it but we don't do anything about it.''

The judges said the racial element was an ''aggravating circumstance'' leading to longer sentences than the defendants otherwise would have received. The defense argued that the maximum penalty should be reserved for even more egregious murder cases, like those involving torture or kidnapping.

Mrs. Hermansen has been on sick leave since the attack, but said she would gladly endure the rigors of another court battle to secure the principle that ''nothing is worse than being killed just for the color of your skin.''

It is this knot of unsettled history that attracted competing militants here on Saturday. Beyond each other, they found civic leaders had discreetly set up proactive ramparts, including the unity rally at the Crispus Attucks Community Center and a daylong basketball competition that kept local teenagers busy.

A white supremacist group from Illinois, the World Church of the Creator, had quietly rented a library room and then alarmed the city by spreading the word of its anti-black, anti-Semitic mission. It soon attracted familiar antagonists, the Anti-Racist Action Group. This is a leftist, often-violent protest organization, according to hate-group monitors who say it seeks face-offs with Neo-Nazi paraders.

''If one or the other didn't show up, they wouldn't get nearly the attention they seek,'' said Marilyn Mayo of the Anti-Defamation League, who said violent encounters had increased as the rival groups visited communities with headlined racial troubles.

York, a city with Colonial roots and a Mason-Dixon line proximity, drew national attention with the homicide indictment last spring of Mr. Brenner's predecessor, Mayor Charles Robertson. He denied any guilt in the 32-year-old street shooting of a black woman, but admitted that as a policeman during the riots of 1969, he shouted ''white power'' and supplied ammunition to white-racist protesters. At the same time, two now gray-haired black men were indicted in the shooting of a white patrolman in that summer's troubles.

''A lot of time has passed since then,'' said Robert J. Hollis, associate director of the Crispus Attucks center, who adds that the city is learning that human relations is a daily obligation and labor.

''We're looking at two different pictures in time,'' said Mr. Hollis, estimating that measurable, if painful, racial progress had been made in York, a city of 41,000 that is about 40 percent minority. More is needed, he said, but the progress will be clear when the trials are completed and, if carried out fairly, the verdicts are accepted peacefully.

Mr. Slavin remained silent throughout his trial, his lawyer making a case by poking holes in prosecutors' evidence. Mr. Wagner, by contrast, confessed in written and videotaped statements and on the witness stand that he had intended to beat up but not to kill the men, Israel Perez Arvizu and Magdaleno Estrada Escamilla, and that he had been motivated by sheer rage rather than a hatred for Mexicans. He said he had acted in self-defense when he repeatedly stabbed Mr. Perez.

He said he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol during the attack, which he said was proposed by Mr. Slavin, who is 10 years older. Mr. Wagner expressed regret in newspaper interviews, on the witness stand and even today in a note he read before his sentencing.

Immigration and racial tension are not new in Scandinavia. For many years, foreigners have been drawn here by accommodating asylum laws and comprehensive welfare systems. But many countries are only now grappling with the fact that they have become mixed societies with the emergence of a second generation made up of the immigrants' children.

Today, there are two Oslo worlds. In western Oslo, shoppers bustle, some clad in sleek furs, and restaurants fill with families paying for specialities like salted lamb ribs with turnip mash. In eastern Oslo, dingy streets fill with some of the 130,000 immigrants, asylum seekers and other foreigners who live here.

These worlds come together in the clinical light spilling onto the pale Norwegian wood benches of Court Room 227 at Oslo's City Court. Here, three neo-Nazis accused of killing Benjamin provide a a graphic image of the hostility aroused by immigrants, who account for about one-quarter of the 500,000 population in the capital of this overwhelmingly white-skinned nation. (Nationally, the figure is around 200,000 immigrants from the developing world in a land of 4.4 million).

On that icy night, Benjamin Hermansen and a friend, who cannot be publicly identified under Norwegian law, met at about 11.45 p.m. so that Benjamin, who had not been at school that day, could hear what happened in class, according to Nicolai Bjoenness, the lawyer for the boy's mother, Marit.

His mother wanted him to stay home. Benjamin had argued with her about going out so late, but in the end left, promising to go no farther than their neighborhood and to meet up only with his friend.

Benjamin had already endured pain. His Ghanaian father committed suicide when he was only 4, Mrs. Hermansen has said.

In a different part of town, according to court testimony, other events were unfolding. Three neo-Nazis associated with a gang called the Bootboys had left a shared apartment adorned with Nazi memorabilia and were cruising the area in a car. At least one of them had a knife.

The cruising neo-Nazis came upon the two teenage boys who, sensing trouble, ''started to walk away,'' said Mr. Bjoeness, the lawyer. ''They saw that the people in the car had shaven heads and so they said to each other: 'Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Nazis.' '' The shaven-headed men left the car. The teenagers ran. The men with shaven heads pursued them. Benjamin Hermansen's friend ran faster, and he escaped.

One of the skinheads overtook the 15-year-old, ''and there's a fight and at this time, Benjamin tumbles over a blue fence and one of the men jumps onto him and stabs him with the fatal wound to the heart,'' Mr Bjoenness said. The assailant ran off. Benjamin rose, staggering toward his home, but collapsed after some 30 yards. ''He was dead when he fell,'' Mr. Bjoenness said.

Since Dec. 3, those events have unfolded anew in the hearings here, where all three defendants have denied the charges of voluntary manslaughter.

The murder has brought one more agony to Benjamin's mother. Profoundly distressed, she declined to be interviewed for this article. ''I am not a pillar of strength and calm,'' she told a Norwegian newspaper in May. ''There are days when I just stare at the wall.''

There are days now when she stares at the defendants in Court Room 227. Sometimes, the trial, which is expected to end soon, proceeds with familiar courtroom languor. At one recent session, Veronica Andreassen chewed gum, Ole Nicolai Kvisler scribbled notes, and Joe Erling Jahr slumped, his head bowed.

Public opinion appears to have swung behind the boy. Benjamin Hermansen has become such an emblem of the struggle against neo-Nazi racism that Michael Jackson, the rock star, dedicated his newest album to ''Benny.''

That came during unsettled times here. Many Norwegians are questioning not only race relations within their society but also a welfare state that, for decades, has drawn on some of the world's highest taxes -- and highest per capita oil exports from fields in the North Sea -- to provide succor and security from cradle to grave.

''We are no longer satisfied with our welfare system,'' said Harald Stanghelle, the political editor of the daily newspaper Aftenposten. ''There's a lack of confidence in social democracy. We were used to having very good schools, hospitals, care for the aged. But now we see that the quality of these basic institutions is not so good.''

Certainly, tensions in this once placid society seem on the rise. Some immigrants, like Erselan Perot, 30, an Iraqi Kurd who claims that he was beaten in a racial attack in a West Oslo nightclub this month, say they sense that hostility toward Muslim outsiders has increased since Sept. 11. ''People are a lot more negative toward us,'' he said in an interview.

While Norwegians insist that their racial debate is far less corrosive than the equivalent discussion in Denmark, there is little doubt that the growing presence of foreigners -- increasing by up to 16,000 asylum seekers, economic migrants and reunified family members every year -- has produced a groundswell of unease reflected in the Benjamin Hermansen case.

Maki Haberfeld, a professor who lectures about hate crimes at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, attributes the drop in incidents to a renewed culture of tolerance across the country.

''The number of crimes gradually declined after nothing new happened and people realized it was not the way to resolve how they were feeling,'' Professor Haberfeld said. ''People decided not to take justice into their own hands, particularly after some of the military successes in Afghanistan.''

But Hodan Hassan, a civil rights coordinator for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Washington, said that while criminal verbal and physical attacks had subsided in recent weeks, subtler forms of discrimination have taken hold.

The evidence of a connection in contemporary events is also elusive. Professors Green, Glaser and Rich studied the incidence of hate crimes against blacks, Jews, Asians and gay men and lesbians in New York City each month from 1987 to 1995. They found that the incidence of such crimes was unrelated to the city's unemployment rate.

The United States does not appear to be unique. Germany experienced a rash of organized violence against foreigners in the early 1990's. Unemployment was high, particularly in the former East Germany. Yet in a study published in The Journal of Human Resources, Jörn-Steffen Pischke and I found no relationship between the unemployment rate and the incidence of ethnic violence across counties in Germany. Likewise, average education was unrelated to the amount of violence against foreigners.

Neither cyclical downturns nor longer-term disparities in living standards appear to be correlated with a wide range of hate crimes.

This is not proof of the absence of a causal relationship, but any causal effect of economic conditions is likely to be complex, indirect and weak. If there was a direct effect, one would expect hate crimes to rise during periods of economic hardship.

But do the findings from these studies apply to terrorism, particularly for the poverty-stricken and poorly educated populations in the Middle East? Hate crimes could be spawned by different conditions from those that are responsible for politically motivated attacks.

The fragmentary evidence on terrorists, however, suggests that the common stereotype that they come from the ranks of the most uneducated and economically deprived is a myth.

From 1996 to 1999, Nasra Hassan, a United Nations relief worker, interviewed nearly 250 people involved in suicide attacks, including failed bombers, families of deceased bombers and trainers. Her conclusion, as reported in The New Yorker: ''None of them were uneducated, desperately poor, simple-minded or depressed.''

Professor Ariel Merari, director of the Political Violence Research Center at Tel Aviv University, concurred: ''All information that I have also indicates that there is no connection between socioeconomic indicators and involvement in militant/terrorist activity in general and in suicide attacks in particular, at least as much as the Palestinian case is concerned.''

The profile of the 19 terrorists who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks -- many of whom were college-educated and from middle-class families -- may not be so atypical after all.

Another fragment of evidence is that the average illiteracy rate of men in the seven countries the State Department designated as sponsors of terrorism (Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) is 17 percent -- about the same as the worldwide illiteracy rate. Ireland and Spain, which have struggled with terrorism for years, are neither poor nor neglectful of education.

The impact of education on international terrorism is undoubtedly complicated. Certainly, terrorists with global reach are likely to be drawn from the ranks of the educated and relatively well off, so they can blend into their new environs. Schools might be preaching hatred instead of peace and harmony, as Thomas L. Friedman has argued in The New York Times.

A country's economic development may influence terrorism and political violence in another way: by affecting the likelihood of civil war.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

A new study by James Fearon and David Laitin, political scientists at Stanford, finds that nations with a lower per-capita level of gross domestic product are more likely to undergo a civil war. In fact, economic development is a far more important predictor of civil wars than is whether a nation's population is fragmented along religious or ethnic lines. Mr. Fearon and Mr. Laitin highlight the role of ''insurgency'' as a cause of civil war: weak states are unable to suppress insurgents intent on waging a civil war. The governments in poor countries lack the means, skills and knowledge to thwart rebellions. In addition, they argue, it is easier for insurgents to recruit foot soldiers where poverty is high.

Why might economic development affect civil wars and terrorism differently? Mr. Fearon suggested: ''You get terrorism when the state is strong and competent enough to prevent the initial attacks of would-be rebel leaders from escalating into a big civil war (e.g., Northern Ireland, the Basque region in Spain, the Red Brigade in Italy). Income, we argue, is a measure of such capabilities.''

So a Marshall Plan to aid economic growth may lead to greater stability. Moreover, fostering development would alleviate much suffering, and promoting education would generate many benefits, including improved health, faster economic growth and participation of the disenfranchised in modern society. Alas, there is little ground for optimism that such worthy assistance would greatly reduce international terrorism.",nytimes.com,True

Wagner when he was arrested last year on charges of helping a friend try to murder two Mexican laborers -- today challenged Mr. Wagner's assertions that the attack was not racially motivated.

Mr. Wagner, 20, of Maspeth is charged with attempted murder and assault, accused of stabbing Israel Perez Arvizu, one of the laborers, in the hands and arm with a fishing knife. Mr. Wagner testified Thursday and today that he was in an uncontrollable rage, under the influence of alcohol and LSD and looking for a fight with anyone on the morning of the attack in September 2000.

But in more than two hours of cross-examination in Suffolk County Court, Eileen A. Powers, the prosecutor, questioned Mr. Wagner repeatedly about keeping his anger in check while he was out drinking with friends the night before the attack.

''When you said it could have been anybody, that's not true,'' said Ms. Powers, asking Mr. Wagner whether he and his friend Christopher Slavin, 30, who has been convicted in the attack, had waited until they were alone with the two Hispanic men before attacking.",nytimes.com,True

But after a Saturday night out with friends, drinking beer and whiskey and taking LSD, Mr. Wagner said, he returned home about 4 a.m. and called Mr. Slavin.

''I pretty much told him, 'I'm angry; let's go beat somebody up,' '' Mr. Wagner testified. ''And he said, 'O.K.' ''

Dressed in a gray suit, his dark hair slicked back, Mr. Wagner spoke in a soft monotone, saying that he had followed Mr. Slavin's lead throughout the morning of the attack and that he had nothing in particular against Mexicans. ''It could have been anybody that night,'' he said. ''When I drink, I just get angry. I punch walls, I broke my windshield before. I just can't control myself.''

Mr. Slavin had placed shovels and a post-hole digger in a car; instructed him to drive to the 7-11, where immigrant workers customarily wait for contractors; and directed him to the building in an industrial park in Shirley where the attack took place, Mr. Wagner testified.

Once the four men were in the building's basement, Mr. Wagner said, he heard a loud noise and saw that one Mexican, Magdaleno Estrada Escamilla, was on the floor. As soon as he turned around, he said, the other worker, Israel Perez Arvizu, hit him on the back of the head with a shovel. Mr. Wagner said he pulled a fishing knife from his back pocket, slashing Mr. Perez in self-defense.

''I was scared,'' he testified in Suffolk County Court.

In the Slavin trial, the lead prosecutor, Eileen A. Powers, tried to prove that the crime was motivated by a hatred for Mexicans by showing the jury pictures of Mr. Slavin's multiple racist and white-supremacist tattoos. When Mr. Wagner was questioned today by his lawyer, Thomas F. Liotti, he said that since the attack, he had had his own racist tattoos inked over. He said he had originally wanted the tattoos ''because it looked cool'' and because ''I thought if somebody looked at me that they wouldn't try to mess with me.''",nytimes.com,True

But a defense lawyer argued that his client, Ryan D. Wagner, 20, did not deserve the same verdict as the friend, Christopher Slavin. Mr. Slavin, 30, was convicted in August on charges that he and an accomplice lured the Mexicans to an abandoned building in Shirley last fall by offering them work, then attacked them.

In opening arguments at Mr. Wagner's trial, the prosecutor, Eileen A. Powers, told jurors today that Mr. Wagner and Mr. Slavin, of Hicksville, had attacked the laborers ''in an effort to kill them.''

Thomas J. Liotti, the lawyer for Mr. Wagner, said the prosecution was exaggerating Mr. Wagner's role and asked jurors to ''look inside the mind and body of Ryan Wagner'' in weighing his intent.",nytimes.com,True

But absent any hard evidence -- his family says Mr. Ahmed threw out the death threat and never reported it to police -- or the suspects, the police say the murder could have been a robbery gone bad.

''We're all struggling, working people in these parts,'' said Carol Martin, a black Fresno resident who like many others turned out at Mr. Ahmed's funeral as a sign of respect even though she had not known him. ''Black, white, green, whatever.''

The Fresno sheriff's office said it has urged anyone who receives threats or any type of verbal or physical abuse to contact them. Groups have offered to escort Arabs wherever they go. And the local schools superintendent said that on Tuesday, Reedley High School held separate assemblies for each of the four classes, ''to help students understand the whole issue, that this is not an Islamic problem but a terrorist problem.''

Mr. Ahmed, an American citizen, had spent 35 years in this country. He and his wife, Fahtima, had eight children, six of them still living in the modest house behind the store. The story of his rise from poor immigrant to middle-class business owner and homeowner with a family, was a classic American tale.

He is the head of the Council of Cooperation of Afghan Immigrants, a political organization, based in Hayward, whose members have been largely pro-Taliban.

Perhaps even more than Muslims, Sikhs in the United States have been singled out for harassment since the terrorist attacks, perhaps because the long beards and turbans prescribed by their Indian religion give them a visual resemblance to the terrorist Osama bin Laden and the Taliban.

''Our turbans have turned us into targets,'' said Mandeep Singh Dhillon, a Sikh spokesman in California. ''It's made it incredibly difficult for Sikhs to walk down the streets safely.''",nytimes.com,True

Then he convened a late-afternoon meeting of his economic advisers to review the damage to an already weakening American economy. For the first time, he spoke of using government spending to stimulate the economy.

Aides said he concluded the meeting by ordering them to assemble a ''comprehensive package'' to bail out the country's major airlines, though the White House would not say if he would back the industry's request for $20 billion in loan guarantees to keep operating at a time few Americans are flying.

The president also seemed to be preparing the country today for the likelihood of casualties in what he said would be a long war, one likely to be fought by unconventional means.

''We will win the war, and there will be costs,'' Mr. Bush said.

But he warned that even if Mr. bin Laden were found, ''there are other terrorists in the world,'' and, turning on his Texas twang, promised to ''get them running and to find them, and to hunt them down.''

As he arrived at the Pentagon, a smoky smell still hung in the air, drifting over from the west side of the building where the hijacked jet slammed into the outer ring and killed 188 people, including those aboard the plane. After meeting with Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and senior military officers, Mr. Bush stepped into the Pentagon cafeteria, where one employee began quietly singing ''God Bless America.'' Gradually it spread throughout the room, and soon Mr. Bush also joined in.

He also spent five minutes talking to the pregnant widow of one of those killed in the attack, rubbing her back and giving her a peck on the cheek as he left.

His trip there, and then to the Islamic Center of Washington, on Embassy Row less than two miles from the White House, seemed part of an emerging White House strategy of trying to portray Mr. Bush as a resolute wartime leader, a compassionate father figure, and an economic strategist. After the White House was criticized for how little Mr. Bush was in evidence on the day of the attack, it may now be ''overcompensating,'' said one Republican figure close to the White House.

Mr. Bush's comments about Mr. bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire believed to be in hiding in Afghanistan, came when he was asked if he wanted the suspected terrorist dead. ''I want him -- I want justice,'' the presdient said. ''And there's an old poster out West, as I recall, that said: 'Wanted: Dead or Alive.' ''

Later his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, made it clear that Mr. Bush was not simply reminiscing about late-night Westerns, and would be happy to have Mr. bin Laden served up either way.

Mr. Fleischer said that the executive order prohibiting United States officials from engaging in assassinations remained in effect. But he quickly added that the rule ''does not limit the United States' ability to act in self-defense.'' He did not say whether the battle against Mr. bin Laden and his organization fit that definition, but he left the strong impression that it did.

In describing his war goals in broad terms, Mr. Bush also talked about destroying the al-Qaeda network of terrorists, a goal Secretary of State Colin L. Powell began discussing over the weekend. Senior White House officials said that the remarks were intended to underscore that Mr. bin Laden's arrest or death would mark only the beginning of the war. Over the weekend Mr. Powell described al-Qaeda as a ''holding company'' for a variety of terrorist groups.

Mr. Bush will spend much of the week trying to build an international coalition to wage war on terrorism, but he and other officials acknowledged today it will be unlike any coalition ever before assembled.

A senior administration official today described it as essentially three concentric circles: Longtime allies like Britain that may provide troops and equipment, states near Afghanistan and other terrorist hot spots that could provide landing locations, intelligence or overflight rights, and finally smaller states and organizations that ''have small capabilities but add an important voice.''

Mr. Bush will be pressing his cause tomorrow when the president of France, Jacques Chirac, will be at the White House for a previously scheduled visit. Then, on Wednesday, Indonesia's new president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, will arrive. She has a tenuous hold on the world's most populous Islamic nation, and one official said today ''we expect she will have to be very careful'' in expressing support for Mr. Bush.

Then, on Thursday, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain arrives for a hastily scheduled visit to discuss joint action. Mr. Bush also spoke today to the emir of Qatar, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who is to come to Washington on Oct. 4.

The administration said nothing today about its military plans, and Mr. Bush stressed again the need for secrecy, saying he would never discuss his options. But Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, speaking about the crisis for the first time, said he expected the United States would also be ''waging a financial war.''

''What you're going to see now is an all-out attack'' on terrorists and suspected terrorists, ''and then systematically going after their financial assets,'' Mr. O'Neill said.

He said he would set up a Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center, drawing on expertise from the Customs Service, the Internal Revenue Service, Secret Service, the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. to track the money that supplies the terrorists. But the Treasury has long had an office charged with doing that, equipped with massive computers that seek to track money flowing around the world.

Mr. Bush's visit to the Islamic center was part of an effort, White House aides say, not to repeat one of American history's greatest injustices: the treatment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.

Mr. Bush invited several Islamic leaders to participate in a memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral last Friday. And today he used his hourlong visit to the Islamic center to make it clear he is focusing on terrorists, not Muslims. ''Islam is peace,'' the president said. ''These terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war.''

He added later that Arab-Americans and Muslims should not have to fear for their safety as they move through their daily lives. Nonetheless, he said, since the attack women ''don't want to go about their ordinary daily routines because, by wearing cover, they're afraid they'll be intimidated.''.

The president of the Council on American-Islamic relations, Nihad Awad, who attended the session with Mr. Bush, said, ''We thank the president for taking the initiative to reach out to the American Muslim community during this time of national crisis. His supportive remarks will help set a tone of tolerance and inclusion for our society.''

In talking about the hijackers, however, Mr. Bush kept up his bellicose language. He once again called them ''barbarians,'' and graphically described the terror they wrought on the airplane that ultimately crashed in Pennsylvania -- a plane administration officials say they believe was on a kamikaze mission toward the White House or capital.

''They slit throats of women on airplanes in order to achieve an objective that is beyond comprehension,'' Mr. Bush said, in a comment his aides said was based on newspaper reports of the killing of a flight attendant. ''And they like to hit, and then they like to hide out.''

Gay bars sit unassumingly next to Colombian bakeries and botanicas in a neighborhood dominated by immigrants from India and Latin America. A visitor would be hard pressed to find a rainbow flag.

But in the last decade, a growing number of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, transvestites and transsexuals have been making their homes in Jackson Heights. That is why the attack last month on Edgar Garzon, a gay man, has frightened many residents.

Around 4 a.m. on Aug. 15, Mr. Garzon and a friend were leaving the Friends Tavern, a gay bar on Roosevelt Avenue, when two men in a red car began exchanging words with him. According to the police account of the incident, the car followed Mr. Garzon and his friend to 77th Street and 37th Avenue. The men in the car jumped out and beat Mr. Garzon with a blunt object, fracturing his skull. He is in a coma in Elmhurst Hospital Center. The attack was deemed a bias crime, and the case has been turned over to the Hate Crimes Task Force.

The attack stirred memories of a similar event that took place 11 years ago just a block away: The victim, Julio Rivera, was beaten to death in a schoolyard.

Mr. Drago transferred to the college in the fall of 2000 from Ocean County College, and soon after, he helped found the Haven, a support group on campus for gay and lesbian students.

As treasurer of a different group, the Gay Union of Trenton State (Trenton State changed its name to the College of New Jersey in 1996), he was well known to many students. The threats against him began in February, when he reported that a note had been slipped under the door of his dormitory room, the authorities said. The note was scrawled with a swastika and, using an epithet for gays, it warned him to ''beware.''

Other notes followed, some posted on the gay student union's bulletin board, others in the lobby of his dorm, the police said. Other students said that Mr. Drago told them that he was an epileptic and was suffering more seizures as a result of the hate messages, and they said that he was sinking into a depression and had stopped going to classes.

This week, upon hearing that Mr. Drago had been accused of sending the notes to himself, many of his supporters said they were dismayed. Beth Tobin, 22, who attended the rallies before graduating this spring, said that if the accusations were true, Mr. Drago's actions were ''disgraceful.''

''To now be told that one of those people stood there knowing he caused all of it is unacceptable and unbelievable to me,'' said Ms. Tobin, who is from Hamilton, N.J. ''If anyone should be worried about hate, it's that kid, hating himself and hating the campus enough to do something like that. All he wanted was the attention. Well, he got it.''

The adviser to the gay student union, Henry F. Fradella, an associate law professor, said that while he was disappointed with the news of Mr. Drago's arrest, the campus's reaction to someone being victimized for sexual orientation was commendable.

The predicament of the second defendant, Ryan D. Wagner, is different.

In sworn statements to the police and in newspaper interviews, Mr. Wagner has already confessed to participating in the attack, apologized and vowed to change his ways.

It is not yet clear whether Mr. Wagner, 20, will testify, said his lawyer, Thomas F. Liotti. But in statements to the police, he described how a plan to beat up the two Mexicans -- a plan that Mr. Slavin had suggested -- spun out of control.

Mr. Wagner, his lawyer said, was acting in self-defense when he pulled out a fishing knife and slashed one of the workers. In interviews, Mr. Wagner has said he was under the influence of L.S.D. and alcohol at the time of the attack and has difficulty controlling his anger.

''Maybe a jury would look at that from a clinical standpoint and say, 'Look, there were these mitigating circumstances in Ryan's life,' and maybe show a degree of compassion for Wagner that they didn't show for Slavin,'' Mr. Liotti said.

It was sheer rage, and not a hatred for people of other races, that prompted the younger man to take part in the attack, Mr. Liotti said, adding that he intended to call at least one psychologist to testify about that phenomenon.

''I think it was about anger management as far as he was concerned, and impulse control problems,'' he said.

Drew Biondo, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney, James M. Catterson Jr., was skeptical of Mr. Wagner's defense strategy.

''He saw what a jury did in a case with less evidence,'' he said. ''I've never seen a jury let a defendant off because of irresponsible actions.''

But Mr. Liotti said his client is different. Since last September, Mr. Wagner has obscured his tattoos, which included swastikas, attended therapy regularly and severed his friendship with Mr. Slavin, he said.

Nonetheless, Mr. Liotti said he is concerned that the first trial may prejudice the second, which is scheduled to begin next month in Suffolk County Court under the jurisdiction of Judge Charles F. Cacciabaudo, who also presided over the Slavin case. Mr. Liotti said he will seek to have the trial postponed, moved to a different county and placed under another judge's jurisdiction.

David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the State Office of Court Administration, said that changes in venue are rare.

Even so, Mr. Slavin's conviction does not necessarily mean that Mr. Wagner will be judged similarly, said James B. Jacobs, a professor at N.Y.U. School of Law.

''One jury could find that one person was acting in some kind of brutal way, and the other jury may find that the other person was less responsible in some way, that he wasn't acting in concert, that he was surprised by the violence perpetrated by the second person,'' he said.",nytimes.com,True

''They were bombarded with imagery and prejudicial testimony and evidence,'' he said. ''I think it made them less open to the physical evidence, and less likely to think critically of the complaining witnesses.''

Mr. Slavin's father, Leonard, seemed shaken by the verdict. ''This is totally different from what we expected,'' he said softly.

Ms. Bensin sat in the courtroom for an hour after the verdict was announced, fighting back tears as she gripped her mother's hand. Earlier in the trial, Judge Charles F. Cacciabaudo had declared Ms. Bensin a hostile witness when she refused to cooperate with Ms. Powers's line of questioning.

Outside the courtroom, lawyers and immigrant advocates celebrated the verdict.

''Everyone has a right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness when they find themselves in the United States, no matter how they got here,'' said the Suffolk district attorney, James M. Catterson Jr.

Outside, a group of day laborers stood in the sun, some with signs saying ''Stop the Hate.'' One, Manuel Bonilla, 42, said: ''That's what we would like to happen, that anyone who's out there who has the same intentions, that they'd think about it twice and decide not to do it.''

''It's a volatile, emotional, heated environment, and we ought to give it some opportunity at the very least to cool down,'' Mr. Liotti said.

The atmosphere during jury deliberations, however, was anything but volatile, said Mr. Eastwood, the jury foreman. The only sticking point was whether Mr. Slavin had intended to kill Mr. Perez and Mr. Estrada or only ''rough them up,'' Mr. Eastwood said. The matter was settled, Mr. Eastwood said, after each juror took a turn lifting the post-hole digger that, Mr. Perez had testified, Mr. Slavin had used to smack Mr. Estrada over the head.

He also said that the lack of other evidence, including a blood trail starting in the basement of the building, where one of the victims, Mr. Perez, said he was stabbed, meant that the events could not have occurred as the day laborers had testified.

After closing remarks, the jury deliberated for four hours before being sent to a hotel for the night.

On the morning of Sept. 17, 2000, Ms. Powers told the jurors, Mr. Slavin and Mr. Wagner collected two Mexican day laborers from their home in Farmingville and took them to an abandoned building in Shirley with the promise of work. But there was never any work to be done, and instead, the prosecutor said, the men were attacked with a post-hole digger and a folding knife, simply because they were Mexican.

Ms. Powers pointed to several pieces of evidence, including telephone calls and testimony by Mr. Slavin's friends, that she said linked him to Mr. Wagner -- who will be prosecuted separately -- on the day of the attack.

Ms. Powers also referred to the testimony of Mr. Slavin's boss, who had said the defendant had worked at a site near the abandoned building, and to the testimony of Mr. Slavin's friend and housemate, Peter R. Horvath.

Mr. Horvath had testified that about 7:45 that morning, Mr. Slavin woke him, suggesting that they and Mr. Wagner go to a spot he knew to walk Mr. Horvath's dog.

''Who drives 13 miles on a Sunday morning to go and walk a dog?'' Ms. Powers asked. ''This defendant is the one that's familiar with this industrial site. This defendant knows about this building, and he knew about the basement.''

Ms. Powers, who spun around several times during her remarks to point at Mr. Slavin, painted a portrait of a man with a motive: he was a follower, according to Mr. Horvath's testimony, of a white supremacist theology called Christian Identity, and a man who chose to mark his arms, chest and stomach with tattoos depicting white supremacist, Nazi and skinhead imagery.

Mr. Del Col, in his remarks, pointed to inconsistencies in the version of events given by Mr. Perez and Mr. Estrada, about the tools the assailants used, for instance. The lawyer also cited what he described as irreconcilable discrepancies between their stories and the evidence.

Mr. Del Col said he felt no need to call any witnesses of his own: the prosecution's own witnesses and laboratory served the defense.

No forensic evidence was found linking Mr. Slavin to the abandoned building, Mr. Del Col noted. He ridiculed testimony that the outline left by a shoe near the building may have been made by Mr. Slavin's boot, which matched the shape and size of the print.

''May have?'' he asked. ''They're pulling rabbits out of hats.''

Mr. Del Col noted that Mr. Perez, who was cut so badly that doctors testified he could have died if left untreated, had told the jury that Mr. Slavin's accomplice slashed him repeatedly with a folding knife, first in the basement of the building and again near a ramp leading out of it.

But Mr. Perez's blood trail did not appear until 100 feet away from the basement, Mr. Del Col said, in a wooded area the men ran through on their way to flag down help.

Also, he said, the T-shirt Mr. Perez was wearing, which a doctor and the prosecutor suggested could have absorbed the blood initially, was never recovered by the police.

The expert, Detective Sgt. Louis Jordan of the prosecutor's office in Monmouth County, N.J., was the final witness to testify in the trial in Suffolk County Court of the man, Christopher Slavin, 29, the first of two men charged in the attack to be prosecuted.

His testimony was allowed into evidence over the objections of Mr. Slavin's lawyer, who challenged the sergeant's expertise and repeated an argument he made earlier in the trial: that the tattoos were being used to make the jury dislike Mr. Slavin and were irrelevant to his guilt or innocence.

As slides depicting Mr. Slavin's tattoos were projected onto a screen opposite the jury box, Sergeant Jordan explained that one, on the man's stomach, showed a skinhead with a sinister, smiling clown face, wielding an ax and a bottle of alcohol as he approached a kneeling caricature of a Jew.

Another, on Mr. Slavin's chest, showed a swastika with a clenched white fist in the center, a symbol of the white supremacist movement, the sergeant said, adding that the black swastika and red ring were symbols of the Third Reich.

Eileen A. Powers, the lead prosecutor, and Robert J. Del Col, Mr. Slavin's lawyer, are expected to give their closing statements in the case Wednesday.

Other records submitted as evidence today show that later that morning, four phone calls were made from Mr. Wagner's home: two to directory assistance, and two to Suffolk County hospitals.

Although the records do not show who placed the telephone calls, prosecutors contend that they are significant because they link the two suspects.

Mr. Del Col also asked Dr. Becker a series of questions regarding what appears to be emerging as a main defense argument: that the absence of blood in certain areas is not consistent with what Mr. Perez and Mr. Estrada told the authorities.

Mr. Perez testified that the attack began in the basement of the abandoned building, where he was first slashed, and continued just outside, when he fell after briefly escaping.

But Mr. Perez's blood trail did not begin until about 100 feet away from the building, Mr. Del Col said.

''Is it a reasonable conclusion that that is where the injury was sustained?'' he asked Dr. Becker.

No, the doctor responded, Mr. Perez's shirt could have soaked up the blood initially.

Earlier in the trial, Mr. Del Col asked detectives why they failed to recover Mr. Perez's bloodied clothing from the hospital, and noted that the two workers' hats were not tested for blood.

Today, Mr. Del Col asked Officer Peter Reilly why he did not note in a crime scene log that Mr. Estrada had returned to the building with the police. ''I meant to get his name at a later time and failed to do so,'' the officer testified.",nytimes.com,True

In her grand jury testimony, Ms. Bensin had testified that Mr. Slavin had left after saying he was going to take care of his sick grandfather in New Jersey. But today, she said that the couple had been fighting and that they needed time apart. ''He just wanted a reason to leave,'' she said.

Mr. Slavin did not return until early November, on the evening before he turned himself in to the police, and Ms. Bensin said she received only two phone calls from him during his absence.

The two still live together, and during a break after Ms. Bensin's testimony, they held hands in the hallways of Suffolk County Court.

The incident focused attention on tensions between the Spanish-speaking immigrants who wait on the streets looking for work and those residents who do not want them there -- tensions that have existed for years in Farmingville, where the men were picked up, and elsewhere on Long Island.

The night before the attack, Mr. Horvath testified, Mr. Slavin called the police because the neighbors were playing loud music. ''Some sort of salsa maybe, I don't know,'' he said.

Ms. Powers also succeeded in establishing that shortly after the attack took place, the two suspects and Mr. Horvath had driven to an industrial park -- perhaps the same place where the beatings occurred.

The crime threw into sharp relief tensions on Long Island over the Spanish-speaking immigrants who wait in the streets for day jobs building homes and landscaping yards. Since September, the conflict has particularly intensified in Farmingville, a community of 15,000 residents, mostly white, where the victims lived and where they were picked up for what they believed would be just another day of work.

Farmingville has since become a flash point in the complicated and emotional battle over illegal immigration, particularly the question of what role local government should play in protecting the immigrants who build homes and beautify gardens, but often do not have the legal status that comes with a green card.",nytimes.com,True

Around midnight Monday, he said, just before the attack on the couple, the men invaded an apartment next door and threatened a white man. One of them pressed a pistol to the man's chest, announced with a racist epithet that they were going to ''mess up'' the couple next door, and threatened to kill the man if he called the police, Mr. Bernardi said. The man, who knew Mr. Nielson, was the first to identify him as one of the attackers, the prosecutor said.

The two men then burst into the apartment next door, and the couple woke up to discover the men standing over them, Mr. Bernardi said. One man -- the police did not say which -- hit the woman in the head with a baseball bat, and as the husband tried to intervene, he was beaten, too, the prosecutor said. Then the husband managed to push the invaders out the door and call the police. The attack was over in a matter of minutes, Mr. Bernardi said.

The prosecutor added that the two attackers were later seen cruising Goodwater Avenue in front of the apartment building, in one of the township's poorer neighborhoods.

Re ''Senate Panel Backs Hate-Crime Coverage for Gays'' (news article, July 27):

It's clear that with 51 sponsors, the Senate is ready to pass a hate-crime bill that would make attacks on gays, as well as attacks based on sex or handicapped status, a federal crime. The last head count in the House also shows overwhelming support for the bill, but John Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, says House leaders will not bring such legislation to the floor.

Hate crimes have no place in our society, and Mr. Hastert must repudiate his spokesman's comment.

Federal legislation and money are needed to stop the spread of hate crimes. The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations calls on all Americans to urge the House to meet its responsibility in combating violence fueled by hate.

Before the hate-crime measure was stripped from the bill in a House-Senate conference last fall, a nonbinding vote showed it commanded a 232-to-191 House majority, and the votes are almost surely still there if sponsors can find a way to bring it up. But John Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said today that House leaders would not bring such legislation to the floor.

The most likely tactic supporters can use is, after passage by the Senate, to attach the bill to a measure House Republican leaders consider essential -- and then insist on it in conference.

Federal law makes it a crime to interfere with someone exercising a federally protected right, like voting or going to school, on the basis of race, religion or national origin. This bill would add sexual orientation, sex and handicapped status to the characteristics to be protected, and would make attacks based on such status crimes. The maximum federal penalty would be life imprisonment.

Federal authorities could act first only if invited in by a state, if a state had no objection, or if a state would not exercise jurisdiction. They could also act later, according to the bill, if ''the verdict or sentence obtained pursuant to state charges left demonstratively unvindicated the federal interest in eradicating bias-motivated violence.''

The bill also includes provisions for a study of the extent of hate crimes in the nation and for grants of up to $100,000 by the Justice Department to help communities that find the investigation and prosecution a severe burden.

Mr. Hatch was the only committee member who spoke against the bill.

''We indicated that Mr. Wagner was acting in self-defense and he has claimed that he was hit in the back of the head with a shovel,'' Mr. Liotti said. ''He has made some mistakes and is very sorry for making those, but let's try and be reasonable. He did not have the requisite mental intent to kill or attempt to kill.

The victims' testimonies will figure prominently in the prosecution's case. Mr. Perez and Mr. Escamilla are expected to testify on the second or third day of testimony in each trial, Mr. Biondo said.

Mr. Catterson said that separate trials are necessary because Mr. Wagner named Mr. Slavin in his statement to the police.

Despite the passage of time and the death of key witnesses, a Birmingham jury convicted Mr. Blanton, 62, after a two-week trial in May. Prosecutors won a critical ruling from Judge Garrett that allowed them to play secretly recorded F.B.I. tapes of conversations in which Mr. Blanton spoke generally about playing a role in civil rights bombings.

But the age of the crime ultimately caught up with prosecutors in the case against Mr. Cherry.

''We're disappointed,'' said Doug Jones, the former United States attorney who directed the prosecution of Mr. Blanton. ''But whenever you're dealing with a case this old, it should be no surprise that things like this come up, whether a physical or mental condition or even death.''

Mr. Jones left the federal prosecutor's office for private practice shortly after the Blanton trial, but had been appointed to prosecute Mr. Cherry as well. He said he doubted that further testing would demonstrate Mr. Cherry's mental competence to the judge's satisfaction.

''We're assuming at this point under the rules of procedure that the only thing left for the court to find is whether or not there's a substantial probability that he can be restored to competence through medication or other treatment,'' Mr. Jones said.

So we don't have a lot of hope that he will be restored to competence.''

''He doesn't understand what's going on,'' Mr. Bass said. ''He thought it meant he was going to have to turn himself in and go to prison. He said, 'What am I going to do with Mama?' ''

The suspected ringleader, Robert Chambliss, lived free until 1977, when he was tried, convicted and sentenced to life. He died in prison eight years later. The fourth suspect, Herman Cash, died in 1994 without ever being tried.

Mr. Jones said today that the prosecution clearly suffered because of the high standard of proof demanded under Alabama law. Once a defendant demonstrates he is incompetent, as was the finding of both a defense psychologist and a court-appointed psychiatrist, the prosecution's burden is then to show ''clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence'' that he is competent to stand trial.

Judge Garrett pointed out in his ruling that this standard is ''substantially different'' from a federal standard that requires only ''a preponderance of the evidence.''

All of the experts at last week's hearing, including two prosecution doctors, found that Mr. Cherry probably suffered from some form of dementia, though they disagreed about its severity. The prosecution experts testified that he was capable of assisting his lawyers and testifying in his own defense if necessary. The other doctors disagreed.

They testified that Mr. Cherry had difficulty performing simple mathematical calculations, that he was forgetful and had trouble remembering recent events, and that brain scans showed gaps in brain activity. They diagnosed him as having vascular dementia, presumably caused by a series of small strokes.

After removing Mr. Cherry from the April trial, Judge Garrett agreed to allow prosecutors to seek their own psychological study of the defendant, a former Ku Klux Klansman. Though details of both evaluations remain private, Mr. Cherry's lawyers have described his condition as one characterized by forgetfulness and contradictory statements. His lawyers did not respond to several calls for comment yesterday.

In preparing for trial, they have said, Mr. Cherry regularly changed his accounts of relevant events, making them nervous about their ability to effectively defend him. The lawyers have said that Mr. Cherry, who was giving long and coherent interviews to reporters as recently as two years ago, had had minor strokes.

Mr. Cherry and Mr. Blanton, 62, are two of four suspects originally identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation shortly after the bombing, which is considered one of the most heinous acts of the civil rights era. One other suspect, Robert Chambliss, was convicted in 1977 and died in prison eight years later. The last suspect, Herman Cash, died in 1994 without being tried.

Prosecutors relied on secretly recorded tapes, in which Mr. Blanton could be heard speaking generically about his involvement in bombings, to win his conviction. It is unclear whether those tapes would help them if they get to try Mr. Cherry. But Mr. Cherry presumably also would be hurt by testimony from several family members who have told prosecutors that he boasted about being involved in the bombing.",nytimes.com,True

Rick Perry, perhaps as early as next week.

Governor Perry, a Republican who was involved in an earlier effort to delay the measure's move to the Senate floor for debate, has not decided whether he will sign it, said a spokesman, Gene Acuna.

''The governor has said he will make a decision when the final legislation reaches him,'' Mr. Acuna said, ''and that is still his plan.''

Texas Democrats, who for years have been trying to strengthen the state's hate crimes law, were blocked in 1999 when, after a bill similar to the current one passed the House, Governor Bush refused to back it despite lobbying from Mr. Byrd's daughter, Renee Mullins.

When that bill died in the Senate without a vote, its backers blamed Mr. Bush and said his lack of support had been dictated by presidential campaign considerations. Mr. Bush never said during the legislative session whether he would sign the bill. Later, criticized by Al Gore during a presidential debate for his stance on the matter, he replied, ''We're happy with our laws on the books.''

The Republicans currently have a 16-to-15 majority in the Senate. In the vote today, all 10 of those opposed to the bill were Republicans, while 5 Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Bill Ratliff, backed it.

The Democratic-controlled House approved the measure last week by 87 to 60, largely along party lines.

Over the weekend, Governor Perry met with Senator Florence Shapiro, a Plano Republican, who today offered the amendment that would have removed the bill's list of specifically protected groups. The amendment was defeated on a vote of 17 to 12. Mr. Acuna said Mr. Perry had favored its more general language.

The bill would amend a 1993 law that provides enhanced penalties for criminals who choose victims based on a bias against ''groups'' of people. The 1993 statute does not specifically designate those groups, and supporters of the current legislation say this omission makes it difficult to prosecute offenders and even renders the law unconstitutional.

Under the new legislation, if prejudice was found to be involved in crimes other than first-degree felonies or Class A misdemeanors, the punishment for the offense would be increased to the punishment prescribed for the next-highest category.

For example, under current law someone convicted of painting a swastika on a synagogue, a Class B misdemeanor, would face a maximum punishment of 180 days in jail and a $2,000 fine. The new measure would provide for up to one year of jail time and a $4,000 fine, the punishment for a Class A misdemeanor.

Mr. Jones's progression from the detachment of his youth has made him something of an emblem of the change in his city, once home to the most violent resistance to civil rights, now a striving community that is making amends. He felt the burden that history had placed on Birmingham, and knew that if he failed, the entire city would pay the price.

''I was real concerned that people would say, 'O.K., this is Birmingham and Birmingham hasn't changed,' '' he said. ''So when the guilty verdict came back, it was such a relief.''

It has all made for a nice valedictory. Mr. Jones, who turned 47 on Friday, has been the United States attorney here since 1997, when he was appointed by President Bill Clinton. Now he is a Democrat in a Republican administration, and like most other Democratic federal prosecutors, he is about to be replaced. A successor was nominated before the Blanton trial began, and Mr. Jones plans to return to private practice, though he has not said when or where.

G. Douglas Jones was born on May 4, 1954, in Fairfield, the son of a worker at U.S. Steel, Birmingham's signature employer at the time, and a homemaker. He attended the University of Alabama and Cumberland Law School before becoming an aide to the Senate Judiciary Committee, an assistant United States attorney and then a lawyer in private practice. He is married and has three children.

Mr. Jones did not personally reopen the investigation into the bombing. The case had been in progress for several years by the time he returned to the United States attorney's office as its chief. Robert Langford, a former special agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s Birmingham office, had quietly begun a review in the early 1990's after being approached by the families of the four girls who were killed.

But Mr. Jones was thrilled when he discovered he would inherit the case. ''I've got to tell you it was a rush,'' he said. ''That this case that I watched 20 years earlier, for better or for worse, was going to be part of my history in this office, it was just very exciting.''

HE made the investigation his mission, though another explosion would temporarily shuffle his priorities. In January 1998, a bomb detonated outside a Birmingham abortion clinic, killing an off-duty police officer and blinding a nurse. The investigation of that bombing, which culminated in charges against Eric Robert Rudolph, took time and resources away from the 16th Street case.

Mr. Rudolph was later charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including the 1996 explosion at Centennial Olympic Park during the Summer Games. But it was the work of the Birmingham authorities, tipped by a witness who wrote down a car tag number, that first identified him as a suspect. Mr. Rudolph escaped into the North Carolina mountains and remains at large, another suspect who has avoided prosecution for years.

''I hope the same thing will happen in that case that happened in court here this year,'' Mr. Jones said. ''I just hope it doesn't take 37 years. The case is ready to go. It's all on a shelf. All we need is the defendant.''",nytimes.com,True

In 1997, I learned that Doug Jones, the United States attorney in Birmingham, whom I knew to be ethical and highly competent, had opened, once again, investigations of Mr. Blanton and Mr. Cherry. The two men were indicted -- and I was astonished to learn that the F.B.I. had tape recordings of Mr. Blanton from the 1960's that incriminated both of them. I was also livid. For more than two decades, Mr. Blanton and Mr. Cherry evaded indictment and prosecution because the F.B.I. held back these recordings. This was evidence we desperately needed in 1977 -- evidence whose existence F.B.I. officials had denied. Had it been provided in 1977, we could have convicted all three of these Klansmen.

I held my tongue when I learned of this deception. I did so to prevent lawyers for Mr. Blanton and Mr. Cherry from trumpeting the F.B.I.'s dishonesty as a distraction. Mr. Blanton has been convicted -- thanks greatly to the new evidence. Mr. Cherry, due to his alleged mental state, may not be tried. There is no longer any reason for me to remain silent.

Why would the F.B.I. aid Klansmen in avoidance of prosecution? I don't know. I consider myself a practical person. I could understand F.B.I. reluctance to share information if it were actively pursuing a case of its own. But all federal statutes of limitation had expired when this deceit took place, and only in state court -- Alabama has no statute of limitations for murder -- could a case against Mr. Blanton or Mr. Cherry proceed. (Mr. Jones, the federal attorney, prosecuted the Blanton case on Alabama's behalf.) Most of the tape recordings admissible against Mr. Blanton in 2001 were admissible in 1977.

What excuse can the F.B.I. have for allowing Mr. Blanton to go free for 24 years with this smoking gun evidence hidden in its files? How can the F.B.I. justify this to the families of four precious girls? I don't know. I do know that rank-and-file FBI agents working with us were conscientious and championed our cause. The disgust I feel is for those in higher places who did nothing.",nytimes.com,True
https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/03/opinion/another-bomber-goes-to-jail.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"In the spring of 1963, after months of demonstrations, the Rev. Fred L. Shuttlesworth, a Birmingham, Ala., civil rights leader, said the city had reached ''an accord with its conscience'' with regard to desegregating downtown department stores. But on a deeper level, Birmingham's conscience and that of the nation have been haunted by an event that occurred a few months later, on Sept. 15. A bomb planted by members of the Ku Klux Klan at the 16th Street Baptist Church killed four black girls -- Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, Addie Mae Collins and Cynthia Wesley -- during Sunday services. After decades of delay, justice and conscience moved more closely into accord on Tuesday, when a Birmingham jury convicted Thomas Blanton Jr. of murdering those children.

Nothing can make up fully for the delay caused by decades of fitful cooperation between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement. But with the Blanton conviction, two of the four main suspects have received life sentences. Robert Chambliss, known locally as ''Dynamite Bob,'' was convicted in 1977 and died in prison in 1985. Those convictions send a powerful message that succeeding generations of Southern prosecutors, such as Doug Jones, the United States attorney in Birmingham, have not forgotten the racial cases that had been either ignored or bungled. The prosecution of the 16th Street case also stands as a tribute to the dignified effort of Chris and Maxine McNair and Alpha Robertson, parents of two of the victims, to keep the memory of the case alive.

The prosecutorial history of the case is a tangled and contentious one. J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director, originally blocked prosecution of the case in 1965, overruling his own agents in Birmingham who had filed reports that Robert Chambliss, Thomas Blanton, Bobby Frank Cherry and Herman Cash, now deceased, had planted the bomb. The Chambliss conviction was secured by Bill Baxley, then the Alabama attorney general, when the F.B.I. gave him some of the files that Hoover had sat on. But as Mr. Baxley argues in an article on the adjoining page, the bureau withheld information supplied to Mr. Jones for the Blanton trial after the local F.B.I. office reopened the case in 1993.

Mr. Baxley believes that with full access to the F.B.I. files he could have brought Thomas Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry to trial with Robert Chambliss in 1977. The passage of time erodes the evidence and available testimony in any case, and that makes Doug Jones's ability to prevail on the highly circumstantial case that could be put together this year a striking achievement. He insisted that the F.B.I. give him full access to 9,000 documents and tapes, including the ''kitchen tape'' that probably sent Thomas Blanton to jail. An F.B.I. listening device placed in the Klansman's kitchen in 1964 caught him telling his wife about planning and building ''the bomb.''",nytimes.com,True
https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/03/us/research-guided-jury-selection-in-bombing-trial.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Because the evidence in Mr. Blanton's trial was almost all circumstantial, the importance of jury selection was magnified, lawyers for both sides said today. And members of the prosecution team said they entered the evidentiary phase of the trial last week confident that they had selected a receptive jury.

''We usually operate on very little information,'' said Andrew M. Sheldon, the Atlanta jury consultant who assisted the prosecution, ''so you can imagine my comfort level at having this amount of research.''

Mr. Sheldon and Doug Jones, the United States attorney here, said it was juror attitudes revealed by their research, not race and sex per se, that guided construction of the jury.

''We struck people whose cluster of attitudes indicated they would be unable to make fair decisions,'' Mr. Sheldon said.

But John C. Robbins, Mr. Blanton's lawyer, accused prosecutors of using objections to juror attitudes to mask their real intent, which he said was to remove white men. Mr. Robbins said the defense's pretrial research indicated that blacks were more likely to have fixed opinions about Mr. Blanton's guilt, while whites ''were a little more open-minded.''

''The bottom line is the jury was picked along racial lines by the government,'' Mr. Robbins said. ''They removed every white man they could, and when they ran out of white men, they got rid of white women.''

One reason Mr. Blanton and several suspected co-conspirators were not prosecuted in the 1960's was the apparent concern that they could not be convicted in that era by a Birmingham jury, which presumably would have been all white. The F.B.I. investigated the bombing, and four suspects were quickly identified, but J. Edgar Hoover, then the F.B.I. director, chose not to refer the case for prosecution.

Another of the original suspects, Robert Chambliss, was convicted in 1977.

In the Blanton trial, Mr. Robbins challenged the prosecution's removal of white jurors, arguing that it violated several Supreme Court decisions. Those rulings, from 1986 to 1994, prohibit using peremptory challenges to strike jurors because of race or sex. Judge James Garrett of Jefferson County Circuit Court ruled after a closed-door hearing on the issue that the prosecution had provided race-neutral reasons for its selections.

One potential juror was struck, Mr. Jones said, because the prosecution feared that the person would make decisions rashly. The juror had been asked how he would buy a vacuum cleaner and said he would do so impulsively with little research.

Several jurors were eliminated, Mr. Jones said, because of concerns about racial attitudes. One, for instance, said his grandfather had been a police officer who worked for Eugene Connor, Birmingham's notoriously segregationist public safety commissioner in the 1960's.

The defense, meanwhile, removed a daughter of Autherine Lucy, the first black student to attend the University of Alabama.

Mr. Sheldon, 58, a lawyer and psychologist, said his research guided the prosecution's decision to not cast the case as an attack on the Ku Klux Klan, because the group had little relevance to many potential jurors. Instead, prosecutors repeatedly emphasized that the bombing had singled out children and a house of worship. As a result, they searched for jurors who were parents and churchgoers. Other important questions asked jurors about school integration and racial conflict.

Mr. Jones refused to say how much he spent on the jury selection process. Mr. Sheldon, part of a growing field of professional jury consultants, said he typically charged $225 an hour, though he said it is unclear whether he would be fully paid.

He worked on the 1994 trial of Byron De La Beckwith, who was convicted of murdering Medgar Evers, the Mississippi N.A.A.C.P. leader, and the later trials of Sam Bowers and Charles Noble for the murder of another Mississippi civil rights worker, Vernon Dahmer.",nytimes.com,True

Mr. Blanton is one of several former Ku Klux Klan members who have long been suspected of involvement in the bombing, but he is only the second to be tried. The presumed ringleader, Robert Chambliss, was convicted in 1977 and died in jail in 1985. Herman Cash died without ever being tried. And Bobby Frank Cherry, who was indicted with Mr. Blanton last year, has at least temporarily escaped trial because of a judge's ruling that he is mentally incompetent to assist in his own defense.

The spacious courtroom, where attendance was sparse earlier this week, was packed with spectators today in anticipation of the playing of the audiotape, which was recorded nine months after the explosion. Blacks and whites squeezed together on the wooden benches, and a balcony gallery was filled with schoolchildren brought to witness history by their teachers and parents.

Despite being professionally enhanced, the tinny, scratchy tape was virtually inaudible to spectators. Jurors listened through headsets and were allowed to use a transcript compiled by the prosecution. But the transcript was not admitted into evidence and Judge James Garrett of Jefferson County Circuit Court prohibited its distribution to reporters. The lead F.B.I. agent in the case, William L. Fleming, acknowledged under cross-examination that it had been compiled with the help of a variety of listeners after the tape had been played numerous times.

The audiotape, which was obtained with a microphone hidden by the F.B.I. in Mr. Blanton's home, records a conversation between Mr. Blanton and his wife Jean.

''What meeting are you talking about?'' she asks.

''You have to have a meeting to make a bomb,'' he responds.

Mr. Blanton's lawyer, John C. Robbins, had objected vigorously to the admission of the tape, but failed to convince Judge Garrett. ''The surveillance itself was illegal, the invasion of my client's privacy was illegal and the playing of the tape in a court of law was improper,'' Mr. Robbins told reporters during a lunch break. Mr. Robbins also complained that the snippet of conversation played for the jury had been taken out of context.

Before 1968, when Congress approved new wiretap restrictions, the director of the F.B.I. and the United States attorney general could authorize surveillance without obtaining a court order, said Mr. Jones, the prosecutor.

In June 1964, an F.B.I. technician named John Colvin, posing as a truck driver, rented an apartment adjoining the Blantons' house. Mr. Colvin and another agent, Ralph Butler, who created an alias as Mr. Colvin's brother, then installed a fingertip-sized microphone in a wall that their apartment shared with the Blantons' kitchen, according to testimony today by the two retired agents. Wiring from the microphone was run through a telephone, allowing the conversations to be recorded in another nearby apartment. To explain away their hammering, the agents told Mr. Blanton's wife that they were installing shelving.",nytimes.com,True

It was reinforced this afternoon by the testimony of another witness, Bill Jackson, a Birmingham barber who was then a friend of both Mr. Blanton and Mr. Chambliss.

Mr. Jackson, who said he once accompanied Mr. Blanton to a Klan recruitment meeting, described Mr. Blanton as a hateful person. ''There was always threats going on,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''Should hang one, blow one up, kill one.''

When Robert Posey, an assistant United States attorney, asked Mr. Jackson whether Mr. Blanton expressed hatred toward blacks, the witness volunteered: ''And Catholics and Jews.''

The testimony by Mr. Jackson and Ms. Vaughn about Mr. Blanton's racial views was left largely unchallenged by Mr. Blanton's lawyer, John C. Robbins. Mr. Robbins told the jurors in his opening statement on Tuesday that they would not like much of what they heard about Mr. Blanton, 62, who he said had been a segregationist in his youth.

But Mr. Robbins sought to undermine the credibility of the government's witnesses by other means today. With Ms. Vaughn on the stand in an elegant two-story courtroom, he focused his cross-examination on her own racial views, challenging her assertion that she was not a racist despite her willingness to spend time with Mr. Blanton. He also elicited information about their sexual trysts in Birmingham's Bluebird Motel, and later told reporters that she ''deserved'' the tough questioning because she had ''bad-mouthed'' his client while holding herself out as ''a pillar of virtue.''

Mr. Robbins, a former law partner of the chief prosecutor in the case, United States Attorney Doug Jones, also got Mr. Jackson to admit that he had lied over the years when questioned about the case by federal agents.

Jurors also were read the grand jury testimony of a civil defense worker, James E. Lay, who occasionally patrolled the area around the church and other Birmingham locations that were considered vulnerable to attack by segregationists.

Mr. Lay, who could not appear because he suffered a stroke several months ago, told the grand jury last year that he saw two men parked near the church at close to 1 a.m. about two weeks before the bombing. He said he saw one of the men, who he said resembled Mr. Blanton, walking toward a church stairwell with a black bag in his hand. When he flashed his car's high-beams toward the suspicious car, the man returned to the car, which sped away without its headlights on. The stairwell was the same one where the authorities believe the bomb was ultimately planted two weeks later.

William Fleming, an F.B.I. agent who was cross-examined about Mr. Lay's testimony, said Mr. Lay's military records also show that he suffered from ''emotional instability'' and had received shock treatments.

Mr. Lay's inability to testify illustrates the challenge of prosecuting such a case so long after the crime. Memories, of course, have become hazy, and at least one key prosecution witness has died.

The late Kirthus Glenn was staying at a house near the church that night. She told investigators she saw a 1957 Chevrolet parked a block away at about 2:10 a.m. on Sept. 15.

Mr. Jones said in an interview that another cost of delay came from losing potential witnesses, now dead, who might have revealed their secrets to clear their consciences.

''A lot of people have died,'' he said, ticking off a list of Mr. Blanton's Klan associates, ''and you have to believe that in this place and time someone would have come forward.''

Mr. Jones noted that Klansmen took a vow of secrecy, with the price of betrayal being death to the Klansman or his family members. ''I think there are just a bunch of people who went to the grave continuing the vow,'' he said.

Judge James Garrett of Jefferson County Circuit Court then released the jury, which is sequestered, because the next two prosecution witnesses were not available to testify until Thursday.

The explosion was considered one of the most dastardly acts of the civil rights era, and suspicions quickly centered on four Klansmen.

A second suspect died in 1994 without being charged.

Mr. Cherry and his co-defendant, Thomas E. Blanton Jr., 62, are the only suspects still alive. State and federal investigators were inspired to reopen the case against them in 1996 after prosecutors in other states won convictions in several dusty killings in the civil rights era.

The case against Mr. Blanton will proceed, with jury selection beginning on Monday. The trial is expected to last several weeks.

The finding that Mr. Cherry suffers from vascular dementia came as something of a shock to the prosecution. The issue was not raised by his lawyers until about a month ago, and then only in a private conversation with the judge. The judge then ordered a psychiatric evaluation.

Vascular dementia ''can manifest itself in the inability to remember events the same way all of the time,'' said Mickey Johnson, one of Mr. Cherry's lawyers. ''We reached a point where we would have to stop sharing information with our client for fear that it would be adopted.''

When Mr. Cherry's lawyers sought bond for him in May, they cited maladies including diabetes, congestive heart failure, claustrophobia and a low tolerance for stress, but never mentioned dementia.

Doug Jones, the United States attorney here, said he planned to ask for another psychiatric evaluation. That could take several months.

Mr. Jones, who sat in on the Chambliss trial while a law student, will help try the state court case in a arrangement with District Attorney David Barber. Though Tuesday's ruling for Mr. Cherry was clearly a significant blow, Mr. Jones has tried to project a calm demeanor.

''It does not change any strategy at all,'' he said at a news conference on Wednesday. ''We're fine either way.''

But the prosecution now must scurry to prepare for a trial with a lone defendant instead of two with cases that might have reinforced each other. Mr. Jones pushed earlier to join the cases, but he now says that he did so only to avoid the inconvenience and cost of two similar trials.

''I don't think it's an advantage or a disadvantage,'' he said of having to try Mr. Blanton on his own. ''We go with what we've got.''

Mr. Blanton's lawyer, John C. Robbins, said that severing the cases should help him by giving him complete control over the defense and by minimizing any perceived guilt by association. But Mr. Robbins said he worried that a jury would be determined to deliver at least one conviction and would now have only one outlet for doing so.

''There might be a backlash against my client,'' he said. ''I assume that the pressure is there to convict.''

A poll conducted recently for the defense found that 45 percent of the potential jurors questioned said they believed Mr. Cherry and Mr. Blanton were either guilty or probably guilty. Despite that finding, Judge Garrett denied a defense request to move the trial to a more neutral venue.

Mr. Robbins said Mr. Blanton, while acknowledging his history as a vocal segregationist, had denied any involvement in the church bombing.

''He was 25 in 1963, and he's not the same person,'' Mr. Robbins said. ''He believed in segregation. Is he proud of that? No. Does he believe now that those positions were wrong? Yes.''

Mr. Jones cheered Judge Garrett's decision on Wednesday to allow prosecutors to play portions of audiotapes obtained from a microphone that the F.B.I. hid behind Mr. Blanton's sink for seven weeks in 1964.

Prosecutors have refused to characterize the recordings, and whether they contain the kind of blockbuster confession needed to solidify a highly circumstantial case is questionable. Mr. Blanton's ex-wife, Carolyn Jeanne Barnes, testified at a hearing last Friday that she and Mr. Blanton always assumed that their home was bugged.

The panel, appointed by the Legislature, said up to 10,000 whites stormed the prosperous Tulsa neighborhood of Greenwood, once called the ''black Wall Street,'' killing at least 40 people and destroying 35 blocks of homes and businesses. But the commission's call for reparations received a more skeptical response.

Gov. Frank Keating expressed the state's regrets, calling the events ''an unforgivable, unexplainable part of our history,'' but stopped short of endorsing reparations.

Larry E. Adair, speaker of the State House of Representatives, said, ''I think everyone is going to proceed with caution on reparations, adding ''We've not really had a formal request saying what the total package would be, and until we know what we're being asked to consider, we're taking a 'wait and see' attitude.''

The commission's report said the amount of reparations was a matter for the Legislature to decide.

The 200-page report describes a night of horror, sparked by a false accusation of rape against a black man and fueled by white envy over a rising black middle class: homes were set aflame, planes dropped turpentine bombs, and the unarmed black men were shot on the street.

Some state leaders expressed more interest in the commission's recommendations for a memorial to the victims and possibly some kind of economic empowerment zone for the Greenwood district than in reparations.

''When this started, we were looking at recognition of the significance of the events, but I don't think anyone originally talked about us having to make payments to families or any sort of settlements,'' Mr. Adair said.

Governor Keating did say he would be willing to raise money for a memorial to the 1921 riot victims.

Despite the cool reception that reparations are receiving among lawmakers, Representative Don Ross, who sponsored the bill that created the commission, which included public officials, historians and business leaders, seemed unwilling today to give up on the idea.

''Reparations can take many forms, and we'll just wait to see what happens in this case,'' he said. ''But I believe good-thinking people will want something to be done.''

He added: ''We told these people to lift themselves up by their bootstraps, and they did, by forming the most successful black community in America. And once they had lifted themselves up by their bootstraps, we destroyed them for it.''",nytimes.com,True

The flier states that a 14-year-old girl had been sexually harassed while riding in a car owned by the Seaman Cab Company. It also named five other livery cab companies in the borough that allegedly harassed girls.

He had been charged with the murder of a federal employee, Joseph Santos Ileto; with the use of a firearm in the murder, and with the illegal possession of a firearm by a felon. Mr. Furrow has a previous felony assault conviction in his native Washington State.

Mr. Furrow, for years a member of the Aryan Nations, a hate group based in Idaho, turned himself in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Las Vegas the next morning, after slipping through a massive police dragnet.

He was casual enough after the shootings that he made his way about 20 miles to Hollywood and then went to Scorecard, a sporting goods store, and tried on Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves baseball caps.

The North Valley Jewish Community Center, where most of the shootings took place, is not a place of worship, but an educational and recreation site serving people of all ages like similar Jewish centers throughout the country.

Elderly people played card games there, parents dropped their toddlers off for preschool, Jewish singles came for tennis matches, and children learned to swim in the pool. There are after-school enrichment classes on gymnastics, karate, cooking and celebrating the Sabbath.

Councilman DiBrienza stressed that a bias attack on any resident was an attack on the whole neighborhood, a thought echoed in the park by Joan Minieri, 38, who was jogging with her baby, Alin, in a stroller.

''When you hear that someone is singling out gay men, the thought is not, 'Whew! At least I'm safe,' '' she said.

The presentation is part of a new MTV social initiative, ''Fight for Your Rights: Take a Stand Against Discrimination,'' and will follow the showing of an original movie, ''Anatomy of a Hate Crime,'' based on the story of Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was murdered in October 1998.

Though the move would seem extraordinary in itself, it seems even more so because MTV is a commercial channel that relies heavily on advertising revenue. MTV executives could not say how many commercials would need to be pre-empted to make room for the scroll, but they put the cost of going commercial-free for 17 1/2 hours in the range of $2 million.

Stephen Friedman, who is in charge of MTV's social campaigns, said that the network decided to run the scroll for a long period so that it could be seen by as much of MTV's audience as possible.

ON THE SCREEN -- The spot combines colorful abstract backgrounds with stark lettering echoing the narration by Ms. Mullins. The letters change in size and location like an MTV video. The final message, over the logo of the N.A.A.C.P. National Voter Fund, is ''Vote on November 7.''

THE SCRIPT -- ''On June 7 1998, James Byrd Jr. was beaten, chained and then dragged behind a pickup truck three miles to his death simply because he was black. Even after such a brutal act as this, hate crimes legislation in many states still remains nonexistent. I'm Renee Mullins. James Byrd was my father. On Nov. 7, let it be known we will not be dragged away from our future. Vote on Nov. 7. Please.''

ACCURACY -- The advertisement's appeal is emotional, recalling the killing of Mr. Byrd. But it subtly reminds viewers that Governor Bush did not support Texas legislation that would have imposed stiffer sentences for people convicted of crimes motivated by sexual, racial or religious bias. Mr. Bush has said that Texas law already imposes harsh sentences for violent crimes.

SCORECARD -- The N.A.A.C.P., and dozens of other independent groups from all parts of the political spectrum, is pulling out the stops in the final days of the campaign to ensure that like-minded citizens vote. This advertisement is designed to motivate African-American citizens to vote by reminding them that some Republican politicians, including Governor Bush, have blocked hate crimes laws at the state and federal level.

An Oct. 28 letter about hate-crimes legislation states, ''There is no precedent in our legal system to increase the harshness of a sentence based on the motive for a crime.''

I would say that the writer is ignoring a major precedent: the distinction between murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide and so on.

Not all cases of killing someone receive equally harsh sentences; a wide variation occurs based on motive and other psychological factors, which do have to be determined in a trial: was it necessity, premeditated, the heat of passion, adequate provocation, etc.?

A killing motivated by hatred of an entire group is particularly despicable, and should receive a particularly severe sentence.

I am a moderate Republican who opposes hate-crimes legislation. I do not consider this view ''anti-gay'' (editorial, Oct. 22).

A murder is a murder: there is no precedent in our legal system to increase the harshness of a sentence based on the motive for the crime. If someone kills a gay friend of mine, I want that person to receive an equally harsh sentence whether the motive is jealousy or hate.

How do we determine which groups should qualify for these laws? If a murder takes place over political views, is that a hate crime? If someone is murdered because of his or her profession, like an abortion doctor, is that a hate crime? We have a difficult enough time determining whether someone has committed a crime; determining motive is even harder.

For all of these reasons, it is unfair to assume that Congressional Republicans opposed to hate-crimes legislation are bowing to ''anti-gay'' voices.

Re ''Two Tests of Fairness for Congress'' (editorial, Oct. 22):

It is particularly disingenuous for some members of Congress, in arguing against hate-crimes legislation, to say that attacks on individuals are already a crime and that to distinguish assaults on special categories of people would create a bias that should not exist.

Why does no one ever remind them that they themselves are protected by special laws that make attacks on members of Congress a federal offense? If they think they need added protection as a result of their special position, it stands to reason that some others might need the same.

https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/22/opinion/two-tests-of-fairness-for-congress.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FHate%20Crimes,"Earlier this month, in a shameful bow to anti-gay voices within their party, Republican Congressional leaders killed hate-crimes legislation that had strong bipartisan support in the House and Senate. It remains to be seen whether hard bargaining by President Clinton over pending budget bills can help persuade the Republicans to revive the measure.

But it is definitely a fight worth making. The legislation would strengthen the existing federal hate-crimes statute by authorizing for the first time the federal prosecution of crimes motivated by the victims' sex, disability or sexual orientation. It would also enhance the federal government's ability to prosecute violent crimes motivated by the victims' race, religion or national origin and its ability to help local authorities investigate and prosecute such crimes.

Two years after the murder of young Matthew Shepard awakened the nation to the high incidence of hate crimes against gay people, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert need to consider the awful message they would send by ending the session without enacting this overdue legal protection.

Last-minute action is also needed to correct a major injustice Congress committed four years ago when it adopted harsh deportation rules. Hundreds of productive immigrants, longtime legal residents, have been automatically deported because of low-level offenses committed long ago.

A bipartisan measure recently approved by the House, while not the whole solution, would at least offer relief for many of those unfairly hurt by Congress's rash crackdown. Specifically, it would restore judicial discretion and due-process rights in those cases where the crime for which the person has been deported, or faces deportation, was committed before the passage of the 1996 law.

It now rests with Republican leaders to make sure that the measure becomes law.",nytimes.com,True

The Filipinos were given a police escort out of town -- at their own request, prosecutors say -- but no arrests were made of the whites. Three Asian-American civil rights groups say the whites should have been arrested on racial harassment charges, this state's equivalent of a hate crime statute.

''If handled differently by local law enforcement, bystanders and other members of the community, perhaps the fatal altercation could have been prevented,'' wrote leaders of the Japanese-American Citizens League, one of three groups pressing the F.B.I. for an inquiry.

In another case on the same weekend, a black man said Mr. Kinison and several other white men chased him down the beach with a knife, using racial insults.

In the letter to the bureau, the leaders of the three Asian-American civil rights groups wrote, ''Our community remains frustrated over what is perceived as the failure of law enforcement to pursue hate crimes against Asian-Americans and the ability of law enforcement to protect us.''

The Hong case has prompted much soul-searching and second-guessing in this overwhelmingly white resort community. Racial crimes are not much of a problem, people here say, but, as is the case in many small towns, the police are criticized for failing to detect patterns of racial hatred.

''If somebody is waving a Confederate flag in this town, the police should be called,'' said Vini Samuels, a lawyer whose family is from India. ''I know I would call the police. But generally, minorities should have no reason to fear coming here.''

The police and prosecutors in Ocean Shores say they acted properly, but were unable to make racial harassment arrests because the victims did not wish to press charges.

''We are not the kind of community that has a lot of trouble with racists,'' said Rich McEachin, the Ocean Shores police chief. ''One bad weekend over 20 years is a pretty good record.''

Chief McEachin said the Filipinos who had been confronted by the whites a day before their run-in with the Hong brothers simply wanted to leave town and did not press for further police action. ''Without their cooperation, we don't have a case,'' he said.

And in the case of the black man who said he was chased, no police action was taken because none of the suspected assailants were identified until after their confrontation with the Hongs, Chief McEachin said.

''This man is walking the streets today and being treated like a victim because he is Asian-American. Is it now acceptable for minorities to kill European-Americans for calling them names?''

Dan Bartlett, a Bush campaign spokesman, attributed the governor's inaction on the Byrd bill in 1999 to several factors. He said Mr. Bush often did not get involved with bills that were not part of his own legislative package. He also noted that critics of the Byrd bill, which calls for stiffer penalties for crimes motivated by race, gender, religion and sexual orientation, argued that it might weaken a statute in effect since 1993. That statute says that penalties can be enhanced if a crime is committed out of bias or prejudice, but it does not specify which groups are protected.

Advocates of the Byrd bill argued that the existing law was too vague.

''He did not show any leadership,'' said State Senator Rodney Ellis, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation. Mr. Ellis and other Democrats attribute the governor's studious avoidance of the bill to concerns that specifying protections for gays and lesbians would offend Christian conservatives.

By so bluntly invoking the death penalty, Mr. Bush brought attention to an issue that he had sought to play down in the campaign. Since taking office in 1995, Mr. Bush has presided over 146 executions, including 33 this year, by far the most of any governor in the nation.

As governor, Mr. Bush's powers to stop an execution are limited. He can grant clemency only with the approval of the state parole board, though he does appoint its members. Otherwise, he can either grant an inmate a 30-day reprieve or approve the execution.

Critics of the Texas capital punishment system have faulted Mr. Bush for defending a system that executes inmates who are mentally retarded, who committed slayings as juveniles and who, in many cases, have been represented by court-appointed lawyers regarded as inadequate. This year, Mr. Bush has interrupted his campaign to preside over the high-profile execution of Gary Graham, who was convicted of murder on the word of one eyewitness.

Mr. Bush also granted the first reprieve of his tenure to Ricky McGinn to allow additional DNA testing in the case. The tests later confirmed his guilt and Mr. McGinn was subsequently executed.

Mr. Bush's blunt endorsement of the executions of the defendants in the Byrd case -- even though the appeals process has only begun -- brought a swift response from some legal scholars and other critics who say the comments undermine the legal principle of due process.

''There has been a thought that he doesn't really take the appellate system seriously,'' said a University of Houston law professor, David Dow, who has represented death row inmates. Of his comments on the Byrd defendants, Mr. Dow said: ''He was celebrating their death sentences. I think even most supporters of the death penalty do not celebrate death sentences. It's a somber event.''

The seriousness with which Mr. Bush's undertakes his obligations toward the death penalty has been questioned before in the campaign. In an interview in Talk Magazine, Gary Bauer, the conservative who was then a Republican presidential candidate, criticized Mr. Bush for appearing to mock Karla Faye Tucker, the Texas killer of two, for pleading for her life in a television interview. Mr. Bush campaign aides said his comments were misinterpreted. Ms. Tucker was executed in 1998.

In early March, in a Republican primary debate in Los Angeles, Mr. Bush laughed when a questioner asked about a case in which a Texas lawyer fell asleep while representing an inmate who later received the death penalty. Mr. Bartlett said the response was not laughter but an expression of incredulity at the question. He also said that Mr. Bush regards his review of death cases as ''his most important duty'' and addresses them in a very serious and factual way.

Julian Bond, chairman of the board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, yesterday joined Ms. Mullins via a telephone conference call and said the N.A.A.C.P.

Before the murder, Mr. O'Malley said, he never much thought about hate-crime legislation, let alone felt a need for it. A registered Republican who voted for George Bush in 1992 and Bob Dole in 1996, he accepted the notion that any crime is a hate crime, so why make the distinction?

Now, he is one the country's leading proponents of a measure supported by President Clinton and most Democratic lawmakers that would broaden federal law to include as hate crimes those motivated by the victim's gender, sexual orientation or disability. The existing law takes into account only a victim's religion, race, color and national origin.

Beyond expanding the definition, the measure would also help small cities like Laramie by providing much needed resources for investigation, prosecution and security. The cost of the Shepard case was so high, more than $150,000, that the Albany County Sheriff's Department was forced to furlough five deputies. It cost the city's Police Department about $25,000 in overtime.

The legislation is in a House-Senate conference committee, and proponents say it has a good chance of passing before the November elections if it remains where it is, as an amendment to the Defense Department budget authorization bill. Mr. Clinton has promised to sign it.

TO drum up support for the measure, Mr. O'Malley has traveled to Washington four times, most recently in mid-September when Mr. Clinton invited him to the White House and thanked him ''as the embodiment of someone who has changed his position on this and has been courageous enough to say so.''

Sitting in the quiet of his office here at police headquarters, Mr. O'Malley said his perspective changed profoundly as the Shepard case unfolded, drawing him close to the world he once ridiculed, a community that included Mr. Shepard's parents, Dennis and Judy, and his friends at the university, who Mr. O'Malley discovered to be terrified at what had happened.

''My eyes got opened up,'' he said. ''I didn't realize how a hate crime affects all gays, not just an individual. Matt's friends were scared to death. Some left town as result of what happened. Some transferred to other schools. They knew that if it happened to him, it could happen to anybody. All kinds of people get killed every day, but I'm not afraid to go down to the liquor store to buy a six-pack as some of these people were. That had a real impact on me.''

''It's absurd,'' he said softly, ''that it took something this tragic to make it hit me. It affected me as well as my family,'' he added, referring to his wife, Jennifer, and their two children.

With the sentencing, the case was over. But Mr. O'Malley's efforts to promote its message -- his epiphany -- was only starting. On his first trip to Washington, he met with Attorney General Janet Reno, Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, John D. Podesta, and several Congressional leaders, including the bill's chief sponsor, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.

On later visits, he met with Ms. Reno, Mr. Clinton, United States attorneys from around the country and more members of Congress. He joined Mr. Kennedy at a news conference last spring, before a Senate vote in which language of the amendment was approved, 57 to 42. More recently, the House passed a nonbinding resolution to approve the Senate amendment.

Oddly, he said, none of Wyoming's three members of Congress -- Senators Craig Thomas and Michael B. Enzi and Representative Barbara Cubin, Republicans all -- are supporting the legislation.

But Mr. O'Malley has vowed to fight on. ''This whole thing has redefined my definition of commitment,'' he said. ''This legislation is a no-brainer that is common sense and a matter of human decency that should not be politicized.

Tonight, despite a soaking rain, immigrant workers and supporters held a march here to draw attention to their cause, trading shouts and taunts with protesters opposed to immigrants. In all, about 150 to 200 people attended, the authorities said.

The authorities said the events leading to the beating began at dawn on Sunday, when two white men first tried to hire another Mexican man who was standing in a field next to a 7-Eleven, one of the most popular spots on Long Island for day laborers and contractors to barter for labor.

According to the victims' account, this Mexican man was a friend. He had already arranged work for himself that day, so he led the two white men to the house that the three Mexicans share with a dozen others.

Mr. Escamilla said he was lured into a silver station wagon by the promise of work. The men never discussed money, he said. The workers were taken to an abandoned warehouse off Exit 68 of the Long Island Expressway in Shirley, and were told to start digging.

Fifteen minutes later, the two wounded workers managed to stumble to the expressway. ''We saw cars, but seeing our condition, the people did not want to stop,'' Mr. Escamilla said. Finally, a man who thought the pair had been in a car accident stopped and called the police on his cell phone.

''It is being treated as a bias attack,'' said Detective Sgt. Robert Reecks of the Suffolk County Police. He also said it appeared as though the ambush was carefully planned.

''It appears as though the assailants were trying to kill them,'' he said.

The attackers were each described as unshaven, about 5-foot-9 and in their late 20's. One man is thin, the other heavyset, Sergeant Reecks said. He added that the authorities were following up on dozens of leads. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was advising investigators.

Mr. Escamilla was treated and released. Mr. Perez underwent surgery for a severed tendon in his left wrist Monday and was listed in stable condition at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital. He was expected to be released this evening.

''I came with a great American dream that all Latinos have,'' Mr. Perez said, lying back in a wheelchair and appearing disoriented. ''It is a great country, but I want to forget this happened. I guess I will go home and I won't be back.''

The attacks added fuel to already smoldering tensions in Farmingville, said the immigrants, their advocates and local politicians.

Each summer, more than 1,000 Hispanic workers flock here looking for work as landscapers and handymen. They are picketed by a group of Americans every Saturday morning.

These residents say the day laborers are responsible for all kinds of problems, from a decrease in property values to a spiraling crime wave that the police say does not exist.

Earlier this month, the Suffolk County Legislature narrowly voted down a proposal to file a federal suit to force the Immigration and Naturalization Service to move against illegal immigrants. And this year, the Town of Brookhaven, which includes Farmingville, passed a law aimed at illegal immigrants, limiting the number of people who may occupy a rental house.

Moreover, the day laborers said, they are often not paid by contractors and must endure insults and racial slurs directed at them by morning commuters.

Joseph Caracappa, a Republican county legislator from Selden, who sponsored the bill to sue the I.N.S., did not return calls left at his office today. The group that urged Mr. Caracappa to sponsor the legislation, said they did not believe their rhetoric had inflamed racial hatred in the community.

''This was inevitably going to happen whether we existed or not,'' said Ray Wysolmierski, a leader of the group, called the Sachem Quality of Life. ''People wait on the corner for people to hire them. Those who hire them aren't going to win a Nobel Peace Prize. As far as I'm concerned, they're all criminals.''

Paul Tonna, the Republican majority leader of the Suffolk County Legislature, said the bill only deepened divisions. ''It demonstrated how much easier it is to destroy a community rather than build one,'' said Mr. Tonna, who voted against the measure. ''After I voted against it, people picketed my home carrying signs that called me a papist.''

At tonight's march, the workers and their supporters asked that the authorities allow them to build a clean, safe hiring hall where they would be better shielded from attacks.

Likening hate crimes to the Holocaust and efforts by Serbs to force ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo, Mr. Clinton urged Congress to endorse the measure, and he said he was ordering the Justice Department to improve its reporting of hate crimes. Some 7,755 hate crimes were reported last year, ''only the tip of the iceberg,'' Mr. Clinton said.

''So this is very important,'' he added. ''It is just not true that hate crimes are like other crimes. It is not even true that every crime is a hate crime. And that fundamentally is at the heart of this debate.''

Mr. Clinton and Congressional Democrats say they hope today's strong vote sends a signal to Republican leaders that they should rethink their decision to kill the measure.

Vice President Al Gore said, ''Passage of a strong hate crimes law will send a clear message that we value everyone in our society, and we will work together to oppose those who use hate to divide us.''

Republicans who voted not to endorse the motion argued that the legislation was unnecessary because hate crimes were already adequately prosecuted by states and localities. They also framed the debate as one of state rights, maintaining that the bill would grant the United States attorney general too much power.

Representative Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, offered an alternative proposal that failed. Mr. Graham argued that all crimes were heinous, none more so than the next.

The police said the black teenagers were part of a group of 10 young men who surrounded six white teenagers in West Brighton at 8 p.m. Monday and shouted profanity-laced, antiwhite remarks. The taunting descended into violence, the police said, when three black teenagers began to punch three of the white youths.

''The motivating factor behind the attacks was that the victims were white,'' one investigator said. ''They said they had a problem with white people being in their neighborhood.''

The attacks occurred near the intersection of Post Avenue and Clove Road, the police said.

One of the attackers was wearing brass knuckles, the police said. One victim, a 14-year-old boy, had a concussion, and another had extensive cuts on his face. The attackers robbed the victims of a silver bracelet, a MetroCard, a personal stereo and $16 in cash, the police said.

Two of the teenagers -- Anthony McCoy, 17, and his brother Peter McCoy, 16, both of 45 Holland Avenue -- were charged as adults with multiple counts of second-degree assault and aggravated harassment.

The chancellor was referring to the demonstrations that led to the collapse of the East German state and the Berlin Wall, a time of euphoric optimism. But a tough reality has emerged since then: high unemployment in the east, bitterness at the western takeover of the area, nostalgia for the security of socialism.

Against this backdrop, rightist, anti-foreigner movements have proved attractive to some youths in the east, though an overwhelming majority of immigrants in Germany live in the west. Christian Richter, one of the accused, said he had attacked Mr. Adriano ''because foreigners take our jobs.''

The court sentenced Enrico Hilprecht, 24, to life imprisonment. Mr. Richter, 16, and Frank Miethbauer, also 16, were sentenced to nine years of detention, one year less than the maximum sentence under Germany's juvenile law.

In a climate of agitation over rightist violence since a bomb in Dusseldorf last month wounded nine immigrants, the sentences were clearly intended to signal that Germany has lost patience with xenophobia and rightist nationalism.

Mr. Schroder said the police and judiciary needed to be tougher on extremists. Some evidence has emerged that the police in the east are reluctant to crack down on the rightists because of tacit sympathy for their cause.

Two security guards, who pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the assault and are now in prison, are expected to be called as witnesses for the plaintiffs. A third guard is a fugitive in the criminal case.

Jury selection began this morning in the Kootenai County Courthouse as members of a special police weapons unit patrolled the roof and the grounds and a sole Aryan Nations supporter marched on the sidewalk nearby, waving the group's black and red flag.

The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son Jason, now 21, told the police that they were driving home from her niece's wedding through the nearby community of Hayden Lake at dusk on July 1, 1998, playing music and having a good time.

Ms. Keenan said that her son had been in the Job Corps and that he threw his Job Corps card out the window on a whim and, inadvertently, his wallet along with it. The wallet had been a gift from his grandfather, she said, so she turned her car around and drove back to look for it. Her son got out with a flashlight and quickly found the wallet, she said, and that is when she realized that they were near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' Hayden Lake compound.

Ms. Keenan testified at a hearing that when she turned around, her 1977 Datsun had backfired, as it often did. Inside the compound, Shane Wright, an Aryan Nations security guard, thought he heard a gunshot. Seeing a car parked on the road, he and Jesse Warfield, then head of security, jumped into a pickup and began driving down the compound's long driveway. John Yeager, a skinhead from California, leaped into the back of the pickup, armed with a semiautomatic rifle. The Keenans fled, with the guards -- three or more in all -- in pursuit.

Mr. Yeager, Ms. Keenan told the police, fired five rounds from the rifle as the guards bore down on her car, screaming for her to pull over. When a bullet flattened the Keenans' rear tire, their car slid into a ditch. Their pursuers ran up to them.

Ms. Keenan said a man, later identified as Mr. Warfield, struck her with a rifle butt, grabbed her by the hair and screamed at her. Other men tried to pull her weeping son out of the car, she said, striking him with a bat and the butt of a rifle.

A gun ''was pointed at me,'' Ms. Keenan told the authorities. ''It made me very scared. I thought I was going to die.'' She begged the men to let her son alone. After determining that the Keenans were unarmed, they relented, explaining that they were doing so because both were white, she said.

Witnesses are expected to testify that as a result of the assault, Ms. Keenan and her son suffer from post-traumatic-stress disorder, depression and anxiety.

In court documents, Edgar J. Steele, a lawyer representing Mr. Butler, Mr. Teague and the Aryan Nations, pointed out that on the night of the attack, the volunteer guards made no effort to notify Mr. Butler of their actions.

Mr. Mathews died in a siege by the F.B.I. in 1984, and other members of the organization are serving federal prison sentences of 40 to 100 years.

Lazio traded charges and insults yesterday over Mr. Lazio's record on hate crimes legislation.

Mrs. Clinton's campaign said that Mr. Lazio was a weak supporter of the legislation and was ''talking out of both sides of his mouth,'' while Mr. Lazio's campaign said that Mrs. Clinton's criticism proved that she was a ''legislative lightweight'' who lacked the ''policy gravitas'' to be senator.

Mrs. Clinton began the volleys in a news conference on the City Hall steps. Speaking with Democratic politicians and civil rights advocates, the first lady urged the House of Representatives to pass legislation that would strengthen current laws against hate crimes. She added, ''My opponent does not support federal hate crimes legislation.''

A decade has gone by since unification; billions of dollars have been spent to usher the area from a troubled past. Yet anti-immigrant incidents ranging from verbal abuse to killings have become part of the fabric of life.

Now, it seems, a critical mass has been reached. It is not that anything fundamental has changed, but the fact that nothing has changed is becoming unacceptable. Last month, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said he had had enough of ''beating orgies by rightist mobs.''

Between the slaying of an Angolan, Amadeu Antonio, on Nov. 25, 1990, in the eastern town of Eberswalde and that of Mr. Adriano of Mozambique on June 11, the racist murder rate has been running at 2 a year by the most cautious government estimates. Human rights groups put the figure at more than 10 a year.

Bernd Ledermuller, the Dresden police chief, ventured this explanation: ''We come from a Communist society where everything was laid out for you. Youth groups, work groups, no decisions to make. And now you have young people coming into a void with often embittered parents behind them and their disorientation turns to neo-Nazi violence.''

It is one theory, no doubt part of the story. For some, SS insignia are simply chic. Behind the violence lies at least a part of fantasy about immigrants, since they are far scarcer in eastern Germany than in the west. The government recently spoke for the first time of possible ''terrorist cells'' among rightist groups.

So now every day, it seems, brings a new government measure: an announcement that $35 million is to be spent on an educational effort to combat racism, a push to ban the rightist National Democratic Party, a plan to send the chancellor on a late-summer tour of the east, a call for ''civil courage.''

But a close look at what happened in Dessau suggests that all this bustle may do little to redress the fundamental problems. These appear rooted in the western takeover of East Germany, the dismantling of its society and industry, and the odd effect on this ravaged landscape of an immigrant asylum policy whose logic has become impenetrable.

Christian Richter, one of the assailants accused of battering Mr. Adriano to death, turned 16 on April 21. In the year he was born, 1984, a vast complex of five-story, prefabricated housing was completed, adorned with monuments to socialist heroism, just north of Wolfen, near Dessau.

The apartments were built largely to house workers for the nearby film factory that began life as Agfa in 1910 and for the sprawling chemical industry at Bitterfeld, which left some of the most intractable pollution in central Europe. Here lay the heartland of East German industry, grubby as the brown coal dragged from its soil.

After German unification, the industries were largely dismantled, with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. Some west German companies arrived -- Bayer makes aspirin -- but the unemployment rate in the Dessau-Bitterfeld region climbed to its present 21.4 percent.

Here, surrounded by disused factories, in a maze of apartment blocks of advancing decrepitude, among adults often exasperated by idleness, Mr. Richter grew up, attending school until last year. His school performance was modest and his family struggled to get by as his father labored in the construction industry.

''What we have here is a normal, not very intelligent young man, a follower of others,'' said Manfred Schlafert, the lawyer who will defend Mr. Richter and has talked with him several times in prison.

''He knows nothing about German politics, the democratic principles of the republic, nothing. But nor, it seems, was he into the neo-Nazi scene himself. If his friends had been of the left, he might have gone in that direction.''

But his friends included Frank Miethbauer, 16, another of the assailants, who lived in the apartment block opposite. Mr. Miethbauer's father is dead and his mother is hospitalized with mental illness. Their son, searching for direction, was drawn to the neo-Nazi movement.

A neighbor, Wolfgang Wibbing, 61, said he often saw the young man with Nazi flags and memorabilia; the police found such evidence when they raided his apartment after the Dessau killing.

Mr. Schlafert said he asked Mr. Richter why he had attacked Mr. Adriano. The reply suggested the influence of Mr. Miethbauer. Foreigners take our jobs away, his lawyer quoted Mr. Richter as saying. Foreigners take advantage of us.

To the lawyer, this was intriguing, for Mr. Richter has never looked for a job. Having left school last year, he entered a college offering a sort of general apprenticeship for the workplace. Whatever xenophobic convictions he had came from hearsay, the background noise of a bitter place.

''Youths sit around and hear the grumbling of ruined fathers,'' Mr. Schlafert said. ''How there was no crime before. How there were jobs before. How foreigners take our money. It's dumb table talk, but it can be potent in a teenager's mind.''

Mr. Wibbing, the neighbor of the Richter and Miethbauer families, manifests some of the resentments prevalent in the Dessau area. Born into the Third Reich, then turned into a citizen of a Communist state, he now lives off the pension of the Western country that supposedly liberated him.

His ideas, he said, are widely shared. A government should think first about its own people. There are no opportunities for German youth, so why should the arrival of foreigners be accepted?

All of them are ''asylum seekers'' -- not necessarily because they came to Germany to seek asylum. Many simply came in search of a job, but that is how Germany categorizes them in the absence of any other legal avenue into the country for unskilled foreigners.

''If we were allowed to work, do a small job, we'd stop lounging around thinking about our problems,'' said Youssouf Coulibaly, 20, from the Ivory Coast. ''It is as if Germany is inviting us to steal.'' Producing a knife from his bag, he added: ''Around here, this is essential protection.''

Many of these young Africans are housed in an asylum seekers' home in nearby Mohlau. A crumbling former Soviet barracks, it has no functioning telephones for the hundreds of immigrants -- the two it had broke three months ago.

Some of the fields surrounding the foreigners' ''home'' are still littered with mines from cold war days. To Africans who have fled war, it is bizarre to find themselves encircled by mines in the midst of Europe.

That is not the only thing that puzzles them. Under German law, while their requests for asylum are reviewed -- a process that often takes over a year -- they have no right to work.

They are not allowed to move around the country, but must remain in the district of their asylum home. Those in Mohlau cannot go to Berlin, a 90-minute train ride away. Most of the foreigners here receive about $190 a month from the state, as well as their housing and health care.

So, on one side stand embittered German youths drawn to xenophobic movements because they are convinced foreigners are taking their jobs. On the other side stand foreigners living on handouts with no possibility of working. Between them, in a hall of mirrors, hatred stirs.

Amadou Camara, 27, from Sierra Leone, is one of the more than 1.5 million asylum seekers who have arrived in Germany since 1993. His father, Modo, was killed by rebels last year and ''I was running'' -- to Guinea, then, hidden in a cargo vessel, to Rotterdam, and from Rotterdam to Hanover.

After the German police picked him up, he applied for asylum and was deposited in Mohlau. He said he would work at anything -- cleaning toilets, doing garden work, helping on a farm.

''But the Germans just park us here like animals in a zoo and give us money,'' he mused. ''It is more than crazy.''

Many German officials agree that the country's immigration policy is skewed. Barbara John, the Berlin city official charged with policy toward foreigners, said ''a corridor'' is needed to give asylum seekers work permits. But wages would then decline and, she contends, German society is not ready for a less regimented labor market.

''We are in this mental prison,'' she said. ''We think, if there are more of us, we all get less. People cannot see that immigration may be a yeast that makes the cake bigger.'' Surveys say most Germans feel that, with seven million foreigners here, the country has enough of them.

Certainly Dessau seems to abound in mental prisons. Suppose, it was suggested to Mr. Schlafert, the lawyer, that a young African like Mr. Camara ran into a youth like Mr. Richter after nightfall. Could it happen again?

Could a 16-year-old white German who has never looked for employment attack a black asylum seeker who has never had the opportunity to work because the German believes the African ''is taking our jobs?''

''Absolutely,'' Mr. Schlafert said. ''This is waiting to happen again at any moment.''

John Greene, an American psychologist in Dessau, said, ''There's confusion, low self-esteem, and some people here get an urge to declare they are not weak, not insecure, by kicking a black man in the head.''

On June 11, that man happened to be Alberto Adriano. He had been in Germany for 12 years, having come under an exchange among then-socialist states for the old East Germany, and worked as a meat packer. He had married a German woman and had three children.

But that night in Dessau he was just a symbol, a specter, for Mr. Richter, Mr. Miethbauer and Enrico Hilprecht, 24. The three youths had met by chance in the station, had a drink and gone for a walk while they awaited their train. It was then that they stumbled on Mr. Adriano returning from a party.

''I hope they get the heaviest sentences, life imprisonment,'' said Mrs. Adriano as she rocked her child. In fact, only Mr. Hilprecht risks that. Both Mr. Richter and Mr. Miethbauer will be judged under Germany's juvenile laws, allowing a maximum 10-year sentence.

Mr. Schlafert believes his client may get rather less, perhaps seven years. ''Mr. Richter told me he was not aware that he was killing Mr. Adriano,'' Mr. Schlafert said. ''He went along with the others, as I think he always has.''",nytimes.com,True

Certainly Germany appears to face a quandary over its identity. With great fanfare, the government today handed over the first of a planned 20,000 ''green cards,'' papers allowing skilled foreigners to come here and work in computer jobs.

It is the first time since Turkish ''guest workers'' were admitted in the 1960's that Germany has formally invited immigrants in this way, a tacit admission that it requires outside talent to remain competitive in a global economy.

But even as the door to legal immigration is pried open a fraction, animosity toward foreigners seems to be rising. Heinz Fromm, the president of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, a domestic intelligence service, expressed outrage similar to Mr. Fischer's in a newspaper interview published on Saturday.

''People are being injured and killed,'' he was quoted as saying. ''These groups keep blacklists, including the names of well-known actors who are identified as Jews. Yet the population does not seem to take all this too seriously. Society must intervene or this development will damage the whole country.''

The response today from the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine was furious. It published an editorial saying, ''Placing the entire German population under suspicion is hardly the way to promote reason.''

Many Germans with no sympathy for rightist violence are troubled by the large number of foreigners, particularly Turks, in the country and by suggestions that Germany must embrance multiculturalism. As a result, politicians have been generally hesitant to broach the questions raised this weekend by Mr. Fischer.

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall a decade ago, rightist violence has become a fact of German life. It is rooted principally in the east, where, since the collapse of the Communist state there, youth unemployment has remained high, alienation widespread and broad exposure to foreigners a novelty.

''There has been a virtually unbroken nationalist tradition in the east of the country for decades,'' said Klaus Klott, a teacher who worked for several years in the eastern town of Jena. ''Exposure to a multicultural society is something entirely new, and in many instances it is violently resented.''

What seems clear from the recent attacks is that even a decade of German unity has not diminished this rightist and xenophobic sentiment. In the last decade, more than 100 people have been killed in Germany in xenophobic attacks.

Mr. Fromm suggested that the spread of Internet sites full of racist invective and the passivity of most Germans had in fact allowed the anti-immigrant groups to spread their message.

''The perpetrators obviously think they will not face much resistance from the community,'' he said. ''They even have the feeling they are acting on behalf of the majority.''

Officials close to Mr. Fischer suggested that the minister was troubled by what he views as the post-Nazi German taboo surrounding nationalist extremism and anti-Semitism. ''What is needed is more open debate,'' one official said. ''An unhealthy silence has descended.''

The recent killing of a child by a pit bull prompted a far more vigorous national debate over dogs than anything that emerged from the killing on June 11 of an African immigrant, Alberto Adriano, by a group of neo-Nazi thugs in Dessau.

This point was made on Sunday in an unusually emotional television debate that touched on the subject, in which Annette Kahane, the director of a foundation that seeks to combat racist violence, noted that no government minister appeared in Dessau after Mr. Adriano's death or issued a statement on his behalf.",nytimes.com,True

Westchester is the only county in the state that requires police departments to report possible hate crimes to the county.

''It is clearly increasing,'' District Attorney Jeanine Pirro said. ''Whether that is because municipalities have a duty to report them or because people think they can get justice if they come forward, it is hard to tell.''

In late May, Assistant District Attorney Mayo G. Bartlett was put in charge of the bias crime unit. Mr. Bartlett, a graduate of Pace University Law School, has worked in the District Attorney's office since 1992. He estimates that a quarter of the bias incidents in the county are directed against property, like graffiti and vandalism. The rest are directed against people and include crimes like assault, robbery and aggravated harassment.

Mr. Zuroski was Mr. Bartlett's predecessor at the bias crime unit.

Besides legal remedies, anti-bias efforts are also focusing on education. In January, Westchester will send police officers to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international human rights organization, in New York for a day of diversity training. The course is modeled on a similar class the center has offered in Los Angeles since 1995.

More than 40,000 police officers and 20,000 educators from around the country have taken part.

The course in New York will be available on a voluntary basis to members of the county's 44 police departments, along with the county police. The program will also be offered to teachers. Issues covered will include hate, the immigrant experience, anti-Semitism, racism and civil rights.

County Executive Andrew J. Spano also plans to work with the Wiesenthal Center to start a program so the elderly can volunteer to monitor hate groups on the Internet. These volunteers would then visit schools and discuss the dangers posed by online hate groups. This effort, to be called the Senior Sentinel Program, will begin sometime next year.

''The people who want to promote hate, use the Internet very skillfully,'' Mr. Spano said. ''But we have a lot of skilled people here, and we can use it positively. By monitoring the Internet, what we're trying to do is answer free speech with free speech.''

Last month the Westchester Holocaust Commission and the Anti-Defamation League completed the first session of the Juvenile Offenders Program. The program is a 20-hour classroom course for youngsters convicted of bias crimes or involved in bias incidents in school.

Besides awareness training and anger management, participants must complete 15 hours of community service. Two 15-year-olds referred to the program by the court system were the first to take the course.",nytimes.com,True

I take issue with Clyde Haberman's July 19 NYC column, ''A Moment to Rethink Hate Crimes Legislation.'' The laws do not punish bigotry, thought or speech. Rather, they increase the penalties where a criminal intentionally selects the victim based on group membership, whether perceived or actual.

Hate crimes laws punish people for actions and the motivation for those actions. The laws also recognize that some crimes are more egregious than others, a concept we have also applied to crimes committed in and around schools and against police officers.

The question of the accused criminal's intent in selecting the victim is for the jury to determine. In the parking space dispute discussed by Mr. Haberman, the assault was not prosecutable as a hate crime because the victim was not selected on the basis of his religion. I trust that the prosecutors, judges and juries of New York State will apply the law only in appropriate cases.

Charles Apprendi, who had shot at the home of the only black family in his Vineland neighborhood, had pled guilty to three weapons charges and his sentence was extendedby Superior Court Judge Rushton Ridgway, who decided the crime was motivated by bias.

A State Superior Court judge resentenced the man, Charles C. Apprendi Jr., a former pharmacist in Vineland, N.J., who has served 5 1/2 years of a 12-year prison term for shooting at the home of a black family in 1994.

Mr. Apprendi, 45, who is white, appealed his case all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled on June 26 that only a jury, and not a judge alone, could decide whether a crime was motivated by bias.

In 1995, acting in accordance with New Jersey's Ethnic Intimidation Act, Judge Rushton H. Ridgway of State Superior Court determined that Mr. Apprendi had been motivated by racial bias when he fired shots at the home of Mattie Harrell and her family, the first African-Americans to move into the neighborhood. The police said Mr. Apprendi told them he had fired the shots to give Ms. Harrell and her family ''a message'' that they were not wanted.

Even Assemblyman Dov Hikind, whose political origins were on the Jewish far right, said he did not consider the first lady an anti-Semite.

Perhaps that was just Mr. Hikind's way of thanking Mrs. Clinton for the condolence call she paid when his father died three months ago.

Regardless of what she did or did not say long ago, the dispute presents Mrs. Clinton with an opportunity to reassess her strong support of hate crimes laws. Bear with us for a moment.

New York State got a version of such legislation last week when Gov. George E. Pataki signed a bill that imposes sterner sentences on criminals who go after their victims on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation or age.

The logic behind the law is that hate crimes -- beating up gays, desecrating Jewish cemeteries, burning black churches -- affect more than the immediate victim; they can terrorize entire communities.

But critics see the law as putting the state on a slippery slope. What is being punished most severely is impure thought: bigotry. The actions -- assault, vandalism, arson -- are already serious crimes. Another problem with the legislation for its opponents is that it creates different classes of victims, thus bending the concept of equal protection under the law.

There is another issue, says Prof. James B. Jacobs, a New York University law professor and a prominent objector to hate crimes bills. This is where the Hillary Clinton fracas comes in.

LET'S say two men argue over a parking space, hardly implausible in this city. One is Jewish, the other not. They start screaming at each other, and then trade punches. As he takes a swing, the non-Jew angrily shouts: ''*!&#@ Jew cents@&%$!'' Do those words sound familiar?

Is this nothing more than guys being dopey? Or is it a hate-motivated assault? It could be interpreted that way under the law. In fact, Professor Jacobs says, there have been comparable situations in other states that led to hate-crimes charges.

He has trouble with the idea of raising a foolish outburst to the level of a felony. ''In a society like this, those are common frictions that occur,'' he said.

''People who support hate crimes legislation think they're going to get Tom Metzger,'' Professor Jacobs added, referring to the California white supremacist. ''What they get is Archie Bunker. That person may have prejudices, but he's not necessarily a hard-core racist.''

Two unidentified white teenagers, both 17, were arrested and charged with the killing; the authorities said the teenagers beat and kicked Mr. Warren to death and then drove a car over his body in an effort to mask the crime.

Mr. Warren's battered corpse drew sobs and shrieks at his open coffin on Saturday as local mourners demanded more information. Many were incredulous when the police insisted that hatred of gays and blacks was not a motive in the slaying.

Friends said Mr. Warren was a gentle person and a church volunteer who had a summer park job and other occasional employment. The friends said Mr. Warren sometimes told of earlier incidents of harassment for both racial and sexual bias.

As people active in the human rights movement congregated here from around the country, members of the Tuesday night memorial crowd of about 400 insisted that hatred had to be at the heart of the killing, whether it was racism, homophobia or a combination of both. In any case, they heard speakers complain that there were shortcomings in existing hate-crime laws.

West Virginia law, like federal law, covers race but not sexual orientation under the hate-crime statute. A bill to remedy this passed the State Senate but died in the House of Delegates earlier this year. In Washington, a proposal pending in the Senate would include sexual orientation under the hate-crime law and enable federal prosecutors to step in when local officials do not act.

R.''

Similarly, in the past decade the church has been firebombed, smeared with racist epithets and shot at by night-riders, Mr. Staples said, calling the incidents ''this spirit of evil that occasionally arises'' among some in the community.

He said he had explained that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies were ''actively investigating'' the death.

While the scope of the police investigation is centered on the four reported attacks at Prospect Park, Councilwoman Quinn worries that other assaults against gay men may have gone unreported by their victims, some of whom might not be openly gay, and others who simply might fear the publicity that could surround such a case.

Pataki today signed into law a bill that for the first time imposes harsher sentences on criminals in New York who single out their victims on the basis of sexual orientation, race, religion or age.

In signing the legislation, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, reiterated his view that crimes spurred by bias can pose a greater threat than other crimes to the victims and to society as a whole. ''People who act on hate need to know that their punishment will be swift, severe and just,'' he said.

''Hate crimes do more than threaten the safety and welfare of our citizens,'' he added. ''They disrupt entire communities and cannot be tolerated. By signing this legislation today, we are insuring that these heinous acts, so inherently destructive to our society, will no longer be tolerated.''

The version approved today marks the first time the words ''gay'' and ''lesbian'' or the phrase ''sexual orientation'' appear anywhere in the dozens of volumes of New York State laws. The Republican Senate had balked for years at including any language pertaining to gays or sexual orientation.

Under the new law, a judge or jury weighing a defendant's guilt or innocence will also be asked to say whether the defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt, chose the victim because of prejudice. If a guilty verdict is returned, the defendant will face a longer prison term if there is a finding of bias than if there is not.

For low-level felonies, the maximum penalty will increase by three years. For more serious crimes, the additional term for a bias crime will be greater -- adding a decade or more to the possible sentence in some cases.

The new law also requires all of the state's law enforcement agencies to keep statistics on bias crimes and the groups singled out, something that only a few police agencies now do.",nytimes.com,True

For an agency that files only a few hundred lawsuits a year, they add, that is a disproportionately high number.

And the agency says it is currently examining dozens of other allegations involving nooses from around the country.

In most cases, officials say, a noose was placed anonymously on an employee's chair, in a locker, or on a door. But the Miami office of the equal employment opportunity commission is currently pursuing a lawsuit on behalf of a black employee, who, it says, had a noose wrapped around his neck, which was then pulled, while he was working for a Florida office of the Asplundh Tree Expert Company. The company, which is based in Willow Grove, Pa., said it had no comment on the suit.

No one is sure why reports of such racial incidents have risen lately. Some employment lawyers see it as reflecting intolerance among certain younger workers who do not remember the civil rights struggles of the 1950's and 1960's. The incidents, experts say, also might reflect resentment among some whites over affirmative action in diverse workplaces where blacks and other minorities were often excluded in the past.

At the same time, says Ida L. Castro, the chairwoman of the equal employment agency, the increase in court cases might also be due to a growing defensiveness on the part of some employers, who sometimes treat them ''almost flippantly.''

''What I see as alarming is not just that employers are now fighting us in courts,'' she said, ''but that they're also making statements implying that such incidents are just horseplay.''

Indeed, a recent exhibit of photographs -- many once used as postcards -- of white participants in lynchings and their lifeless victims only reminded viewers of why nooses are such an incendiary emblem of America's not-so-distant past.

Nor are noose incidents confined to one region of the country.

Jeff Lanza, a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Kansas City, Mo., says his office is investigating two cases of nooses left in workplaces. The regional office of the equal employment agency in Charlotte, N.C., has three racial harassment lawsuits pending where nooses were said to be involved.

The Miami office has an equal number, including one in which a Sanibel Island, Fla., country club has been charged with failing to act against several workers accused of holding up a hangman's noose to a black groundskeeper before asking him whether he wanted ''to go for a ride.'' Art Cassell, a member of the board of governors of the Sanctuary Golf Club in Sanibel, said the suit was ''completely without merit.''

The Dallas office of the commission is investigating four such cases. In Detroit, the agency is continuing to pursue a lawsuit on behalf of Ms. Hamilton. And the agency has one current lawsuit in California.

Still, the cases the equal employment office is pursuing may represent only the tip of a workplace iceberg. The agency handles just a small fraction of the thousands of lawsuits that are filed privately between employees and employers each year.

Employment lawyers say that it is impossible to say how many of those cases involve noose incidents. But David Bennet Ross, a managing partner at Seyfarth Shaw, a law firm based in Chicago that represents employers, thinks they ''happen with surprising frequency.''

Mr. Ross said he could think of only one noose-related lawsuit in which a court had found that an employee had fabricated the claim, in order to collect money.

''They're a sign,'' he said, ''that something serious is going on in the workplace.''

Employment lawyers say that incidents involving nooses are now appearing at large and small companies alike.

Mr. Lanza, the Kansas City F.B.I. agent, said that until recently cross burnings seemed to be the ''hate crime of choice,'' in his area, but that noose incidents are now appearing instead.

''I've been here 12 years and I can't remember any other noose cases that preceded the two we now have,'' Mr. Lanza said. The Justice Department considers noose incidents to be federal crimes of intimidation, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

Over all, racial harassment charges have surged over the last two decades, with the E.E.O.C. reporting that it received close to 50,000 such charges during the 1990's, versus roughly 10,000 in the 1980's.

The agency considers noose incidents to be among the most egregious forms of racial harassment.

Yet some employees say they have lost their jobs after speaking out against racial harassment incidents like the display of nooses.

In January, Harold H. Archuleta, a former mechanic for American Airlines, filed a lawsuit against the company charging that he had been wrongfully fired for complaining about aircraft safety violations, and also for supporting the racial harassment and discrimination claims of another American employee, Charles L. Walker.

In his court papers, Mr. Archuleta, who is Native American, said that his superiors at American took no steps to prevent, among other things, the ''prominent'' display of nooses at the airline's maintenance facility at Los Angeles International Airport.

During the two or three years before he left American in May 1998, Mr. Archuleta said he saw three nooses displayed at the maintenance facility: one in the area where the company gave out time cards, another in front of a production control office and a third carried by Mr. Walker, as he was on his way to complain about it to his managers.

Each time he saw a noose at his workplace, Mr. Archuleta recalled recently, he ''couldn't believe it was happening.''

Tim Kincaid, a spokesman for American, a unit of the AMR Corporation, said that the airline settled Mr. Walker's case out of court last fall. As for Mr. Archuleta's suit, Mr. Kincaid said that a company investigation found no evidence of racial harassment at the Los Angeles facility, and that Mr. Archuleta's claims were simply an effort to ''mask his own misconduct.'' According to American, Mr. Archuleta was fired for failing to remove outdated life vests from certain airplanes, a charge that he denies.

At Lockheed Martin, the military contractor, seven current and former hourly employees at its plant in Marietta, Ga., filed a lawsuit in Atlanta in May charging that the company had excluded them from its promotion process. They also stated that Lockheed Martin management had ignored -- or conducted only a cursory investigation of -- numerous racial harassment incidents, including some involving the display of nooses. In the suit, Joseph Banks, a Lockheed employee who still works for the company, said a hangman's noose was placed in his work area last summer.

Mr. Banks took his complaint about the noose to the equal employment commission in October last year. On the same day, another Lockheed employee, Ted Gignilliat, who had earlier accused the company of discriminating against him because he is disabled, also filed a complaint that he had received threats after witnessing a noose at the company.

Mr. Gignilliat says that he has seen roughly a half-dozen nooses displayed during his tenure with Lockheed, and that the two most recent incidents occured during the spring of 1999. He says that he reported the most recent incident last September to Lockheed's human resources department, but that his effort received no response, as did another a month later to the security department.

Mr. Gignilliat said he was spurred to act, in part, after Lockheed managers issued memos in August stating that the company thoroughly investigated all harassment and discrimination claims.

Sam Grizzle, a Lockheed spokesman, said that the noose Mr. Gignilliat reported last fall was already under investigation and that the company was not aware that he had ever reported any other incidents.

Meanwhile, in a response last month to the May lawsuit, Lockheed denied the employees' charges. In its court papers, Lockheed acknowledged that a rope tied in the shape of a noose had been found in Mr. Banks' department, but said the rope was not in his work area. The company, which declined to comment more specifically because of the litigation, stated that it had investigated the incident ''immediately and thoroughly,'' but had not been able to determine who had left the noose.

Mr. Ross, the employment lawyer, said he advises companies that have received a complaint of racial harassment to investigate immediately. But unlike many other harassment cases, it is usually difficult to identify the culprits because most nooses are left anonymously.

In the case involving Ms. Hamilton, Northwest Airlines, in its court papers, said that it learned of the noose incident only after Ms. Hamilton had been denied a promotion, and after she had gone to the equal employment agency to complain about racial and sexual harassment at the company. Ms. Hamilton said that she had indeed notified the company when the incident occured.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The company also argued that the noose that Ms. Hamilton found was simply a piece of rope, and that there was no evidence it was directed against her or any member of a minority group.

The equal employment agency's suit against Northwest involving Ms. Hamilton and some other employees at its Detroit cargo facility has yet to be resolved.

Meanwhile, in January the agency's San Francisco office also filed a noose-related lawsuit against Northwest. It charged that employees at the airline's maintenance department at San Francisco Airport subjected a Filipino mechanic, Marcel Espiritu, to almost five years of racial harassment. After Mr. Espiritu filed his accusation with the federal agency, officials say, he found a noose hanging in his locker, along with a note that read ''get Marcel.''

William R. Tamayo, a regional attorney for the equal employment agency, says that Northwest Airlines never did enough to investigate the incident. In response to both cases, Kathy Peach, a spokeswoman for Northwest, said that it was company policy not to comment on lawsuits in litigation. ''We believe that it is dangerous to draw conclusions before the legal process has been fully completed,'' she said.

As for Ms. Hamilton, the noose she found in 1995 still haunts her. Last fall, while attending a work-related conference in Minneapolis, she ran into a Northwest vice president, who showed her a newspaper article on the lawsuit and then expressed surprise that she still worked for the airline.

Shaken, Ms. Hamilton went back to her hotel room, only to discover while packing that she had unwittingly hidden the noose at the bottom of her garment bag.

''It was like getting a double whammy,'' she recalled. ''I need to find a better place to put it.''",nytimes.com,True

''It tore the whole family up,'' she said. ''We will never be the same. Today is a slap in the face as far as being a minority goes.''

The first bullet entered the wall near her son Michael's bed. At age 14, she said, he still has trouble sleeping. She and her husband divorced a few years after the shootings, she said, in part because of the stress the gunfire caused.

The police said Mr. Apprendi had told them that he had fired the shots to give Ms. Harrell and her family ''a message'' that they were not wanted. But he later said he suffered from an obsessive-compulsive disorder that prompted him to shoot at the house.

New Jersey officials, however, said that with legislative fine-tuning, the 10-year-old law could be modified to pass constitutional muster.

Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and legislative leaders said they would change the law to reflect the decision, which struck down only part of the state's Ethnic Intimidation Act.

''What we need to do is amend the law, and put that power before the jury,'' the governor said. ''They didn't say you can't have hate crime legislation. They didn't say you can't have penalties to it.''

Mr. Apprendi's lawyer, Joseph D. O'Neill, said: ''The bias crime law carries a social stigma, a stigma that you're a racist. I think that deserves a decision by someone's peers.''

Mr. Apprendi has served five and a half years of his sentence and is now in a halfway house, his lawyer said. He was not available for comment. Mr. O'Neill said his client would have to go before a jury for a new sentence.

Lisa S. Gochman, a deputy state attorney general who represented the state before the Supreme Court, said she believed that there were two other New Jersey cases in which defendants had received longer sentences because a judge had found them guilty of bias crimes. They will also have to return to the trial court for new sentences.

Ms. Harrell and her children continue to be the only African-American family in their neighborhood. Her other neighbors have been supportive, she said, and the family never considered moving away.

New Jersey, No. 99-478, was one of the most closely fought and in some respects surprising of the term. The case cut across the court's usual ideological lines. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justices Scalia and Thomas also filed concurring opinions.

The dissenters were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer, who each wrote dissenting opinions, along with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Anthony M. Kennedy.

The court had been pointing in this direction in recent decisions, but the majority opinion put the holding starkly and unequivocally: ''Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.''

The New Jersey hate crime law is similar to a law in North Carolina, but differs from those of other states that make the finding of a biased motive an element of the offense that the prosecution has to charge in the indictment and prove to the jury like any other element of the crime.

The New Jersey law was challenged by a Vineland man, Charles C. Apprendi Jr., who had pleaded guilty in 1995 to firing several bullets into a neighboring black family's home. The maximum sentence for the firearms offense was 10 years.

Under the hate crime law, the prosecutor asked the trial judge to find that the crime had been motivated by racial bias. At a hearing, Mr. Apprendi, who is white, disputed the charge, but the judge found against him and sentenced him to 12 years. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the law in a decision last year.

The Supreme Court sent the case back to the New Jersey state court to reconsider the sentence.

Writing for the majority today, Justice Stevens said that ''at stake in this case are constitutional protections of surpassing importance,'' the right to due process of law and the guarantee of a trial by jury.

He said that it was one thing for a judge to exercise discretion within the statutory range for the offense as set by the legislature. But he said the court could not accept ''the novelty of a legislative scheme that removes the jury from the determination of a fact that, if found, exposes the criminal defendant to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone.''

Responding to the decision, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said, ''What we need to do is amend the law and put that power back in the jury.''

While the majority opinion suggested that the constitutional problems could be avoided as long as any judicially imposed sentencing factors kept the final sentence within the statutory range for the offense, the dissenters expressed considerable doubt that the decision could logically be confined within those boundaries.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Justice O'Connor said that if the decision meant, as it appeared to, ''that a defendant is entitled to have a jury decide, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, every fact relevant to the determination of sentence under a determinate-sentencing scheme,'' then the ruling ''will have the effect of invalidating significant sentencing reform accomplished at the federal and state levels over the past three decades.''

Further, she said, the decision ''threatens to unleash a flood of petitions by convicted defendants seeking to invalidate their sentences in whole or in part.'' Justice O'Connor said the majority's failure ''to clarify the precise contours of the constitutional principle underlying its decision'' left federal and state judges ''in a state of limbo.''

The court will almost immediately have a chance to indicate whether it wants to let this debate simmer in the lower courts, or assign itself the task of clarifying the full import of today's ruling. The justices have been keeping several cases involving the sentencing guidelines and, particularly, federal narcotics sentencing, on their docket while awaiting a decision in this case.

There have been sporadic talks on a bill to change the Republicans' much-maligned rules for holding presidential primaries. All sides agree an accord is still possible, but none consider it highly likely, if only because the negotiators are dealing with so many other issues.

A number of other highly charged proposals that have been discussed appear unlikely to produce agreement, including raising the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.75; making information on every doctor's history of malpractice suits, judgments and settlements available to the public through a Web site; adding judges to the New York City courts to relieve overcrowding; and easing Rockefeller-era drug laws.

Last Wednesday was originally scheduled to be the last day of the legislative session, but with so many issues unresolved, Mr. Silver, a Democrat, and Mr. Bruno, a Republican, agreed to have the Assembly and the Senate return for one day, Thursday. There is nothing to prevent them from convening again later in the year, but Mr. Bruno has ruled that out, saying that if there are no agreements Thursday, the Senate will pass its own versions of several bills, a take-it-or-leave-it gesture to the Assembly.

The issue of hate crimes, where there is no real disagreement, has become mired in ego-driven squabbling, and while a deal still seems likely, it is far from certain. The Assembly and the Senate have passed similar bills providing longer criminal penalties for crimes whose victims are singled out due to bias based on race, sex, religion, age, sexual orientation or disability, an idea supported by the governor.

Mr. Bruno has said he would not make the Senate, which has never passed a hate crimes bill before this year, vote on the issue again in the form of a compromise bill. Many Senate Republicans were upset at being forced to take a stand on the issue, and unhappy that its passage was widely portrayed as an attempt at finding political cover in an election year when the Republicans are worried about their hold on the Senate.

A compromise could be enacted by having the Assembly pass the Senate bill, and then having both sides pass a second bill amending the first one, to reflect the compromise. But that way, New York's hate crimes law would go down in the books as having been a Senate bill, and that is unacceptable to the Assembly Democrats, who have passed a hate crimes bill 11 years in a row, and want to take credit for it. And in any case, it is not clear that the Senate Republicans would agree to an amending bill.

Officials say that for some time, there has been agreement on a package of gun controls, much like those proposed earlier this year by the governor, that would be among the most restrictive in the country. They include a ban on assault weapons, mirroring the federal ban, a requirement that trigger locks be sold with all handguns and the creation of a ''ballistic fingerprinting'' computer database to track bullets and shell casings found at crime scenes so they can later be matched to guns.

But the gun bill has been tied to an overhaul of New York's sexual assault laws, an issue that got new impetus with last week's attacks on women in Central Park. Officials say that to a lesser degree, both are also linked to proposals to curb school violence and to the hate crimes bill -- if only in the psychology of the Capitol, which often dictates that a collapse in talks in one area can explode deals in another.

The governor, a Republican, and the Senate leaders are seeking tougher penalties for a variety of sex crimes, and they want to give prosecutors the right to appeal sentences and bail settings in sex crime cases. The Assembly's version raises some penalties, but focuses on improving services for victims, including ensuring coverage of emergency room services and counseling.

The Republican presidential primary rules became an issue earlier this year, when Mr. Pataki and the party took intense criticism for their unsuccessful efforts to keep John McCain off the ballot in New York. The governor and the Senate agreed on a bill to make it easier for candidates to get on the ballot, to simplify a ballot that voters had complained was confusing, and to make New York's a winner-take-all primary.

Democrats say they have no objections to the Republicans' reforms -- which, in many ways, mirror the rules the Democrats have used -- but that the bill could interfere with the Democrats' ability to set their own presidential ballot rules. Mr. Silver has also questioned why a bill must be passed this year, with the next presidential primaries still almost four years away.

Senator Gordon H. Smith, a freshman Republican from Oregon who co-sponsored the bill with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, appealed to those who he said had told him they did not want to vote for the bill and thereby seem to be approving homosexuality.

''No matter how we pray, nor how we sin, we can stand up for each other,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We can stand up against hate.''

Mr. Kennedy told the Senate, ''Hate crimes are rooted in hatred and bigotry, and if America is ever going to be America, we should root out hatred and bigotry.''

The only senator who spoke against the bill was Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Hatch contended that the measure was unnecessary because hate crimes were already being adequately prosecuted by states and localities, and unconstitutional because it invaded state authority.

He proposed a narrower bill that would require a study of whether states were ignoring hate crimes.

''I don't think it is true,'' he said. But if it was, he added, he might support a measure like the Kennedy-Smith bill.

''Hate crimes are abysmal,'' he said. ''They are horrible. We should all be against them.''

Mr. Hatch's proposal for a study was adopted, 50 to 49.

But if Mr. Hatch was the only vocal critic, others who voted no made it clear that the protections based on sexual orientation had turned them against the measure. The only previous time when either house has come close to passing a bill protecting gays was in 1996, when a 50-to-49 vote in the Senate defeated a move to prohibit job discrimination based on sexual orientation.

The Kennedy-Smith bill, like Mr. Hatch's proposal, would authorize federal grants and other assistance to state and local law enforcement officials to prosecute hate crimes.

It would make a federal offense of crimes involving bodily injury motivated by a victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation or disability. Federal law now prohibits crimes based on race, national origin or religion, but only when the victim was seeking to exercise a federally protected right, like voting, registering for school or using a restaurant. The bill passed today would also make a federal crime of random hate crimes, like the 1998 murders of James Byrd Jr. in Texas and Matthew Shepard in Wyoming.

But to reach the Shepard case, and also hate crimes against the handicapped or based on sex, the prosecution would have to establish a direct connection to interstate commerce, though the connection could be no more than use of a gun bought in interstate commerce.

And before a federal indictment could be obtained, the Justice Department would have to certify that it had consulted with the local authorities, who either had no jurisdiction or intention to act, or that the state had requested or at least did not object to federal action, or that the state had completed prosecution.

Whatever the fate of the legislation, today's vote propelled the issue into the political campaign. At the presidential level, Mr. Gore's enthusiasm contrasted to the attitude of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. On March 22, 1999, Mr. Bush said he opposed including sexual orientation in a hate-crimes bill the Texas Legislature was considering. When that bill died without a vote, supporters of it blamed him and said his lack of support was dictated by presidential campaign considerations.

Tonight Mr. Gore embraced the bill eagerly, saying, ''Because hate crimes are an affront to all Americans, this vote is a sign of hope for all Americans.'' He said the next task was to get the House to vote on the measure. But he was asked about the reluctance of Republican leaders, like Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, who said, ''I don't see that happening.''

House leaders may come under some quiet pressure from their troops to enable the bill to become law -- just as the New York State Senate, under Republican control, shifted its stance earlier this year and passed such a bill.

The only opposition to the Kennedy-Smith bill came from Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who heads the Judiciary Committee. He said no one had shown that federal intervention was necessary and that the Supreme Court's recent decisions on federalism foreshadowed a ruling that Congress had no business making federal crimes of what were basically state offenses.

Mr. Hatch said he believed that ''hate-related violence is to be abhorred.''

''Nobody can deny that hate crimes are occurring,'' he said. ''I want to get rid of them as much as anybody.''

Mr. Hatch said he might eventually be convinced that a new federal crime law was needed. But, he said, all the Senate should do was to demand a report on the effectiveness of existing law enforcement efforts on hate crimes and to provide grants to states to help them with such cases.

The Kennedy-Smith bill would also provide grants to states to help pay for prosecutions. But its major provision would be to create a federal offense of crimes involving bodily injury based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation or disability. Mr. Kennedy stressed that the federal government would act only if states approved, or if they failed to pursue a case.

Existing federal law deals only with crimes based on race, religion and national origin, and only in cases in which the victims had been seeking to exercise a federally protected right. Those include school enrollment, jury service, traveling in interstate commerce and using a place of public accommodation.

Even if the Senate adopts the measure, a direct vote on it in the House is no more than a remote possibility, because of Republican opposition. But strong White House support could force House leaders to accept it in the wrap-up legislation needed to end the session and let lawmakers go home to campaign for re-election.

Mr. Shepard was a gay 21-year-old student who was beaten to death in Laramie, Wyo., in October 1998. Earlier that year, Mr. Byrd, a 49-year-old black man, was dragged to his death in Jasper, Tex. The killers in both cases were convicted, but proponents of the Kennedy-Smith proposal said the bill would have made it easier to prosecute them and would have avoided financial burdens on local law enforcement.

As evidence that a new law was needed, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, cited not only the Shepard and Byrd killings, but also a series of attacks on gay men in Michigan. In those cases, he said, the prosecutions would have been stronger if the federal government had been involved.

''In one united voice,'' Mr. Levin said, ''we must not only condemn these acts of violence that terrorize Americans every day, we must act against them. America's agenda will remain unfinished so long as incidents like these occur regularly.''

Maybe the Central Park videotapes should be required viewing for all adolescents in the metropolitan area.

Women were the victims not only of violent thugs but also of some police officers who, people have charged, ignored reports of the park rampage and of threatening behavior before and during the parade.

THOSE complaints, now under investigation, did not surprise one veteran police officer who called to talk about police passivity, first citing rules. Then, what is probably the real reason: self-preservation.

For that entire time, Republicans in the State Senate have blocked the legislation because they were unwilling to include gays as a protected group in any hate-crime bill.

This month, at the request of Gov. George Pataki, the Senate finally dropped its objections and approved a bill increasing penalties for crimes that single out victims because of their race, gender, national origin, age, disability or sexual orientation. But now this effort may be jeopardized because of a ridiculous contest of egos and credit-taking in which the two houses appear to be engaged.

The Senate passed the governor's bill, and insists that it will not vote on any other bill. The Assembly, which passed its own bill, has not approved the Senate legislation, perhaps because it has championed this issue for years and does not want the Senate to get credit now for producing the final legislation. There is some difference in the language of the two bills, but they would both achieve the same goal -- increasing punishment for crimes driven by hatred.

Over the past month, Mr. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, has sought to present himself as a moderate Republican, to the evident concern of Mrs. Clinton's advisers. The television advertisements come at the end of a week in which Mrs. Clinton has begun attacking Mr. Lazio for his votes in Congress.

Mrs. Clinton has now become the first candidate in the Senate race to use negative television advertisements, an event that several politicians described as an early watershed in the rapid escalation of this race.

Typically, candidates for office refrain from running negative advertisements until relatively late in the campaign, instead using their advertising budgets to present their views and background to voters.

Mrs. Clinton's advisers said that her campaign had made the move now as part of an aggressive attempt to help voters form opinions of Mr. Lazio. This is the first in what is likely to be a series of such advertisements. ''This is going to be a race of clear contrasts, and voters deserve to know where the candidates stand on the critical issues,'' said Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio.

Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, asserted that in both advertisements Mrs. Clinton distorted Mr. Lazio's record in an attempt to discredit him. He described the ads as ''a desperate act by a desperate campaign.''

He added, ''History teaches us that the first victim of a Clinton campaign is the truth, and that is apparently the case in this race as well.''

The first of the two advertisements focuses on Mr. Lazio's opposition to a Democratic version of a so-called patients' bill of rights. Among other things, it provides patients with the right to sue health maintenance organizations for mistreatment. Mr. Lazio supported a Republican bill that instead focuses on giving tax deductions to help people pay their medical premiums.

The second advertisement focuses on Mr. Lazio's initial opposition to a hate crimes bill passed by the State Senate in Albany.

ACCURACY -- The ad about health care focuses on a highly partisan dispute in Congress. It refers to the narrow Senate defeat on June 8 of a Democratic bill that would have enabled patients to sue their health maintenance organizations, which had earlier been opposed by Mr. Lazio in the House. But Mr. Lazio has supported Republican versions of managed care legislation, including one that would have allowed provide new tax deductions to help people pay medical bills.

The ad about hate crimes legislation, which was approved by the New York State Senate on June 8 and is being negotiated by members of the Assembly, is correct in saying that Mr. Lazio first opposed the measure, then somewhat reluctantly endorsed it as a compromise.

SCORECARD -- The two short TV spots are the first produced by Mrs. Clinton's team that resemble attack advertising. Without the first lady's voice being heard, and her still photograph all but overwhelmed by the hard-edged script scrolling across the screen, the new ads provide a sharp contrast to her previous advertisements. Those ads evoked warmth and calm judgment as Mrs. Clinton or the narrator spoke of her record and aspirations, instead of attempting to point out missteps by her opponent.

The new ads seem intended to call voter attention to narrowly drawn issues instead of to Mrs. Clinton's personality. Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, responded angrily yesterday, saying, ''New Yorkers deserve better than this and they are going to reject the politics of mudslinging Mrs. Clinton has begun.''

Will that put hatemongers on the run?

As far as New York City goes, so-called bias crimes have been declining even without such a law. They dropped 24 percent from 1996 to 1999. There was a slight rise in the first five months of 2000, due almost entirely to a spate of church desecrations in Brooklyn, which seemed to end after the arrest of a suspect last month.

For sure, the New York law will not silence its critics. They dismiss such measures as palliatives that may sound fine but that, among their other failings, mock the concept of equal protection under the law while penalizing defendants extra hard for the crime of harboring thoughts that society deems unacceptable.

For more than a decade the Republican Senate has blocked such legislation. Gov. George Pataki has been supportive of tougher penalties for bias-related crimes and has offered his own program in recent years.

Senator David A. Paterson, a Democrat from Manhattan, introduced the first hate crimes bill in the Senate in the 1980's. ''Now I can die in peace,'' the 46-year-old senator said today. ''If nothing else ever happens here, I feel that I can point to a contribution that I made.''

Senators in both parties said the bill is certain to pass, with all or nearly all the Democratic votes and several Republican ones, as well. But it will be an unusual break with the tradition here that the majority party in either house will not allow a vote on a bill if it needs minority party votes for passage. To do so is considered a sign of weakness.

The Senate's turnabout on a measure that polls show is very popular comes in a year when the Republicans are nervous about maintaining their 36-to-25 majority in the chamber in the November election.

Advocates of the hate crimes bill have been handing out leaflets in the districts of Republican senators who are considered vulnerable, particularly those in Nassau County, where a voter backlash against the party last November gave Democrats control of the county Legislature for the first time. And they had made plans to broadcast radio and television advertisements, criticizing those vulnerable lawmakers for the Senate's failure to act.

In the last several months, the Senate has moved sharply to the left, placating various interest groups by voting to increase cigarette taxes, to create health insurance subsidies for the working poor, to require that cigarettes meet fire safety standards, to make it a crime to block access to abortion clinics, to impose new restrictions on lobbying, and to decriminalize the sale and possession of hypodermic needles.

Under the governor's bill, a judge or jury weighing whether a defendant committed a crime would also be asked to say whether the defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt, chose the victim because of prejudice. If a guilty verdict is returned, the defendant would face a longer prison term if there were a finding of bias than if there were not.

For low-level felonies, the maximum penalty would increase by three years. For more serious crimes, the additional term for a bias crime would be greater -- adding a decade or more to the possible sentence in some cases. The Assembly bill takes a different approach procedurally, and would add a maximum of four years to sentences.

The governor's bill would also require all of the state's law enforcement agencies to keep statistics on bias crimes and the groups singled out, something that only a few police agencies now do.

A jury or judge could find that a crime was motivated by prejudice even when the defendant was mistaken about the victim's identity. For instance, a defendant who believed his victim was Hispanic could be convicted of a hate crime even if the victim was not.",nytimes.com,True

The fact is that Winchell, killed for being gay, wasn't gay, at least not in the traditional Harvey Fierstein sense of the word. Barry Winchell, who had only ever dated biological women before, was in love with a pre-operative transsexual -- a transgendered woman,'' as Addams prefers it -- part male and part female, a gentle being without a clear portfolio in the black-and-white realm of the sexes. In fact, as in the film ''Boys Don't Cry,'' whose doomed transgendered character generated an Academy Award this year, almost every element of the Winchell case falls into the gray in-between. The biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling, in her new book, ''Sexing the Body,'' says that this state of being ''either/or, neither/both'' is increasingly common.

But the more that Winchell, like Matthew Shepard before him, has been held up as a martyr for gay equality, the less room there has been for explaining such sloppy complications. ''A lot of people just don't get that this woman -- tall, lovely, beautiful -- has male parts,'' explains Kathi Westcott, a staff attorney for Servicemembers' Legal Defense Network (S.L.D.N.), the gay soldiers' group based in Washington. ''It was a difficult connection to make for people, even in the gay community.''

Westcott swept into Tennessee days after the killing determined to investigate Winchell's murder and expose the antigay sentiment that persists in the military. She and Rhonda White, co-director of the Nashville-based Lesbian and Gay Coalition for Justice, paid Addams a visit and made a proposal. ''For the sake of clarity,'' White recalls Westcott saying to Addams, they should tell reporters she is a he. ''Barry was dating an anatomical male,'' White says. ''How can you say he was gay-bashed if he was dating a woman, you know?''

Addams, a nightclub performer, agreed -- I was really worried I would lend some sort of Jerry Springer element to this awful crime,'' she says -- even though she found it ''devastating'' to be called a man, after her long journey away from manhood. In news accounts, she was Winchell's ''boyfriend'' or his ''cross-dressing friend,'' always he and him. Each qualification carried the story away from its truth. By superimposing a rigid grid of sexual identity over the lives of Calpernia Addams and Barry Winchell, the activists effectively severed the soldier from the love for which he died.

''Each of these little words was erasing my existence,'' she says. ''It was like our relationship -- the basis of our relationship -- was all a dream.''

Over coffee at a sidewalk cafe one evening in Nashville, she tells me, ''If I had been a really attractive blond buzz-cut guy who worked out all the time, they probably would have taken me around everywhere to speak on this. I don't think anybody said, 'Let's hammer Calpernia down during this horrible time.' Their hearts were probably in the right place. It just all turned out wrong as far as my part of it was concerned.''

Since then, organizers of the April 30 national gay rally -- officially called the Millennium March on Washington for Equality, a sign that at least in principle people like Calpernia are embraced by the movement -- invited Barry Winchell's mother to speak. But nobody even thought to ask Addams if she was going. ''We don't have a vocabulary for dealing with these issues,'' says Bill Turner, a Nashville activist who is the author of ''A Genealogy of Queer Theory,'' to be published in July. ''Calpernia Addams has really fallen victim to our limitations.''

By all outward appearances, Calpernia Addams is a very beautiful and painfully shy, slightly awkward woman who measures, thanks to recent medical interventions, 36-30-38, understated proportions for her nearly 6-foot frame. She has a woman's hands, a woman's comportment, a woman's slender etherealness. Only her wispy voice and broad shoulders belie the merest hint of manhood. She says she appropriated the name Calpernia Addams from a distant relative in the Addams Family movies who, fingered as a witch, was made to dance naked in the town square. She added the middle name, Sarah, from ''The Crucible,'' and found it gave her an easier moniker ''to shout to a handsome man over the din of a sports bar.'' (She will not reveal her birth name, which she legally changed, and, estranged from her parents, she would not put me in contact with them.)

Legally she is a man. By accident of finances, she says, she remains genitally male. Sexual reassignment surgery can cost $15,000 or more.

In Barry Winchell's boyish vastness (he stood 6-foot-2), quaint chivalry and Midwestern ebullience, Addams found the closest thing to happiness she has ever known: ''He never was ashamed to go anywhere with me. And he treated me just like a normal girl, and that was the most wonderful feeling, to have an attractive, masculine, nice man treat me like a woman, like I wanted to be treated. It put me at peace and gave me a feeling of self-confidence that I have never had.''

Just as Addams is not yet female and no longer purely male, as a couple they were not wholly straight or acceptably gay. Rather they occupied a rare middle ground encompassing both, and neither: socially heterosexual, sexually homosexual, uncomfortably on the margins of all worlds. Theirs was a secret minority. While one in 30,000 men and one in 100,000 women eventually initiate treatment for sex-change operations, even more say they are just as happy to be neither male nor female. At the University of Minnesota's Program in Human Sexuality, one of the largest transsexual centers in the country, administrators now routinely admit patients who take only half the journey from one sex to the other, choosing hormones without surgery, or surgery without hormones, says Bean Robinson, Ph.D., the associate director. ''We see there's a lot more complexity to the world,'' she says.

For Addams, though, like many people preparing to undergo sex reassignment, she is hypersensitive to the differences between male and female. ''For me I choose to cling to the thought that I am a woman,'' she says. ''That's what I want to be. And that's my goal. I know I wasn't born that way, but I think I have to have some kind of guiding light to move toward. If I personally were to embrace a theory that gender were meaningless or fluid, then I would just be lost at sea.''

Barry Winchell didn't seem to care either way.

Being a dead-on marksman and a favorite of his sergeant's, Winchell gave off a certain all-soldier impression even among the 23,000 macho recruits at Fort Campbell, headquarters for the famed ''Screaming Eagles,'' the elite 101st Airborne strike force. Tall and muscled, he earned the respect of other Delta Company soldiers, who gave him the nickname Top Gun because of his facility with the .50-caliber machine gun. By the time of his death, he had been nominated for Soldier of the Month, his mother says.

Still, he did not immediately fit in. He had trouble putting up with his roommate, a volatile drinker with emotional problems from Lincoln, Neb., named Justin Fisher, 27, who liked to bully Winchell with impunity. Nevertheless, it was Fisher who took Winchell to his first gay bar in March of last year. The Connection, in the pure show-biz tradition of Nashville, bills itself as the largest gay bar in North America. It is mammoth, encompassing a discotheque, a two-stepping room, a gift shop, a restaurant and a cavernous performance arena for over-the-top, lip-synching drag spectaculars.

Justin Fisher had been there before. On weekend nights, clutches of soldiers and straight couples mix in easily with the show's pansexual audiences, which can swell to 2,000. Back on base afterward, Fisher had extolled the realness of one of the Connection's drag queens, whose towering beauty, according to testimony, he found so unbelievably stunning. So he returned with Winchell and several other soldiers to show them his discovery.

The indelible performer was Calpernia Addams. Her act, a kind of Elvira-meets-Joan Jett extravaganza, involves loud rock 'n' roll, a great deal of strutting and shimmering and a scant sum of clothing. She has a certain Gypsy Rose Lee quality of vulnerability. Her fans flank the catwalk in waves to offer her folded dollar bills, sometimes by the fistful.

It was no different for the soldiers that night. They sat at a table near the stage and whooped good-naturedly throughout her act. Addams visited them during a break after the 11 p.m. set.

She says she talked to Barry Winchell last because he was so shy, but immediately fell victim to his pretty eyes and silly laugh. He told her he had never met a drag performer before, but was always ''curious about such things.'' Somehow, they approached the topic of a date for later in the week. ''At the start, I guess I was a bit more aggressive than he was,'' she admits.

They fell into an easy affair. Winchell brought almost no philosophy or gender theory to this relationship. He considered his girlfriend to be a woman, yet considered himself gay for sleeping with her, friends of Winchell's say. ''He wasn't really torn or tortured about those things, and once he felt comfortable with me, our sexuality together was very easy,'' Addams says. Addams would introduce him as heterosexual, but he would always correct her, saying, ''It's O.K.''

''They were very attached to each other,'' says Mike McCoy, a friend of both from local gay bars. ''Wherever he was, you wouldn't find her too far behind. Just like an ordinary couple would be.''

Winchell spent weekend evenings on the floor of Addams's dressing room, beneath a Vesuvius of crinoline and fake fur, studying his manuals while she performed -- a case of beer Winchell brought still sits beside a rack of clothing in the tiny, dusty room. After the show, they would rent videos or go downtown for coffee. Among their friends from the Connection, especially other performers, their love affair was taking on a celebrated character. ''Oh, she was happy,'' says Regine Phillips, a transgendered performer. ''It was kind of like a movie.'' Kim Wayne Mayfield, who performs at another Nashville bar as Kimmie Satin, adds, ''You could tell there was a girl and a boy and you could tell which was which and he was just happy as all get-out to be with her.''

For Addams it was a dream come true. ''Among the transgendered women here in Nashville, we have a jaded understanding of 'the way it is,' ''she says. ''And one of the cold hard facts that we understand is that a lot of the straight men who are attracted to us are actually closeted gay and they may not even have admitted it to themselves. We bring them into the gay community and introduce them to people and they start to get comfortable, and the next little step is that they leave us behind and start dating men. It's really lonely.

''But Barry? Barry just seemed to take me at face value. He liked me for me, as much as that sounds like a cliche. He thought I was beautiful and he enjoyed our sex life totally. The sexual-reassignment surgery, he seemed totally like he didn't care whether that happened or not. I felt comfortable that he wasn't going to use me as a bridge. I finally was able to really let myself relax and accept his love.''

''It's ironic I'm a showgirl,'' Addams allows in her dressing room before going on one evening. ''I grew up strictly forbidden to dance or bowl or roller-skate, forbidden from swimming in mixed-sex pools or staying out on a Saturday night. I was quiet and sensitive. I never lisped really, and I never said 'Girl!' or 'Miss Thing,' and I didn't like Madonna or do a lot of this'' -- she cocks her head from shoulder to shoulder and throws her snapping hand in the air. ''I wasn't a stereotypical queen. I was just like a quiet, sensitive person who wrote poetry and walked in the woods and played violin and stuff. I wasn't delicate, really, but I wasn't really boyish. I think I just wasn't anything. I was so busy concealing everything that I just came out as a blank.''

In pictures, Addams is a skinny, dark-haired boy with wide eyes and an ethereal comportment -- unless he consciously forced his hands to stay in his lap, Addams says now, they seemed to float in the air when he spoke. Nonetheless he looked all boy, not androgynous in the least. Inside was a different thing. He had crushes on other little boys, and was jealous of every girl he knew, starting when he was 6.

He knew something was different about him -- he often awoke shrieking in terror, convinced that he was mandated for hell. He suspected homosexuality, but had no inkling of gender dysphoria. He suffered from a crippling body-image problem: he often skipped school because he couldn't stand to be looked at and wrote in his notebook over and over again, ''I'm so ugly.''

Sensing that to survive he needed to get away, Addams joined the Navy after high school and, ignoring his desires, served happily as a combat medic in Al-Jubail in Saudi Arabia during the gulf war. The other soldiers accepted him. But his recurring struggle with depression eventually led him to a Navy psychologist, who warned him up front not to discuss any issue that might get him shipped out on a gay discharge.

It wasn't until he finished his tour and returned to Nashville in 1994 that he visited his first gay bar -- the Connection -- and saw his first drag queens. ''I just thought I had never seen anybody that pretty in real life before,'' Addams recalls. ''And I couldn't hardly believe they were boys. And when I found that out, I thought, If they can do that, I can do that.''

Encased in shimmering organza and garish drag makeup for the club's Wednesday amateur night, something wholly unexpected happened. A heavy weight lifted. Dressed as a woman, Addams no longer suffered crushing self-hatred. As if by force of an explosion, she came to believe that she had never been a man, not in her soul.

''I realized that moment that I have to either choose to live through the constricted filter of a man's body, or else to try to change that body as much as I could to reflect what I wanted to be, and what I feel like I am,'' she says. She began hormone treatments in 1997 and embarked on her resculpturing a year later. A final surgery, which will physically and legally make her a woman, is something Addams plans to undertake three or four years down the line.

Addams had only begun feeling comfortably female about the time Winchell and Fisher first came to take in her performance. But all of this postmodern gender parsing was pretty well lost back on base. According to testimony, which the S.L.D.N. has synopsized (Army transcripts have not been released), Justin Fisher's mood, usually foul, grew malignant in the days that followed his trip. That week, Fisher told Sgt. Michael Kleifgen, a section leader, that a soldier whose name he wouldn't reveal was gay. Sergeant Kleifgen began an investigation, in direct violation of ''don't ask, don't tell.'' When he zeroed in on Winchell, he asked him point-blank if he was gay. Winchell denied it, and the probe went no further.

But Fisher also informed other Delta Company soldiers, and Barry Winchell became the target of ceaseless hostilities. ''Pretty much everybody in the company called him derogatory names,'' Sergeant Kleifgen told the court (a base spokeswoman would not make him available and calls to his house went unanswered). ''Basically, they called him a 'faggot' and stuff like that, I would say, on a daily basis. A lot of times, he was walking around down in the dumps.'' The Pentagon is expected to issue a report on Fort Campbell's command climate this summer.

J. Cortland Torres, 24, a gay Fort Campbell soldier and friend of Winchell's who, fearing for his own safety, requested a discharge after the murder, describes the base culture as a ''Lord of the Flies'' of anti-gay fever. ''I honestly think that if the Army didn't promote this hatred of gays, this wouldn't have happened.''

Winchell probably did not know Fisher was behind it at first -- in fact, he had every reason to believe Fisher was among the most accepting of his unusual romantic situation. The two returned to the Connection together on several weekends. One night, according to Addams, Fisher asked her to fix him up with Kim Wayne Mayfield, who was in full Kimmie Satin drag. Beneath the makeup, Mayfield, 32, is all man. Fisher knew this, Mayfield says, and it didn't seem to deter him. ''He flirted with me for several weeks after that, and I flirted back,'' Mayfield recalls.

Ultimately, according to Mayfield, the two groped one another in the dark confines of an after-hours club and talked about an affair, which never did happen. According to testimony, Fisher bragged to another soldier that they had made out. In another wrinkle, last May Fisher stood over Winchell as he slept and fondled his feet, according to Addams. ''When Barry told me about that, he just thought it was very weird,'' she recalls. ''He was like, 'What the hell are you doing?' and Fisher said, 'Oh, I'm just drunk, I'm sorry.' ''

Whether or not these near-dalliances made Fisher gay, they definitely placed him in a distant sector of the continuum that the feminist Judith Butler calls the ''gender matrix.'' A forensic psychiatrist who examined Fisher, Keith Caruso, says the soldier suffers from something he calls ''transvestic fetishism,'' meaning that for sexual titillation and psychological succor, Fisher has turned to wearing women's underwear, and to those who share his fancy, since he was 14.

Why, then, would he foment hostilities against Winchell? Rhonda White, from the Tennessee gay rights group, blames that least understood beast, internalized homophobia. But maybe by announcing Winchell's secret to the world, Fisher was testing the waters for what might happen if his own secrets were to slip out -- nothing good, as was instantly apparent.

Or perhaps, as his lawyer Michael Love argues, Fisher's psychoses were entirely unrelated to homophobia, the similarities between these lives utterly coincidental. Indeed, Fisher has been given diagnoses of narcissistic personality disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, robust alcoholism and mild depression.

Throughout the spring of 1999, Fisher called Winchell derogatory names. He found an aggressive co-conspirator in a newcomer to Delta Company, Pvt. Calvin Glover, 19, an excessive drinker from a fractured Oklahoma family. Having been intermittently homeless before joining the Army, Glover had met gay teenagers in his hometown, but had not shown any animosity toward them, says Cynthia Brown, former director of the Ada Youth Shelter in Ada, Okla. ''I didn't see him being homophobic,'' she says. ''He doesn't have that kind of malice.''

Regardless, Glover became Winchell's chief tormenter, admitting that he picked a fight with Winchell on Saturday, July 3, at the start of a three-day keg party on base celebrating the long weekend -- heavy drinking was common on Ft. Campbell, even among minors like Glover. Glover taunted and humiliated Winchell throughout the afternoon. Finally, when he reached to knock a beer out of the gay soldier's hand, Winchell had enough. He threw Glover to the ground, hitting him several times. Most of the other soldiers applauded the outcome. But Fisher would not let it drop. He taunted Glover for getting ''beat by a faggot,'' according to testimony. ''A faggot cannot kick my [expletive],'' Glover reportedly hollered as Winchell skulked off to bed. ''I could [expletive] kill you!''

The drinking continued the following evening. By all accounts, Glover had at first buried the hatchet and played Wiffle ball with Winchell. Back in Nashville that same night, Calpernia Addams was competing in the biggest pageant of her career, the Tennessee Entertainer of the Year Contest, taking on the outsize personalities of drag queens, transvestites, transsexuals and transgendered stage legends from across the state. Donning a beaded black pantsuit, she lip-synched to Sinead O'Connor's haunting rendition of ''Don't Cry for Me Argentina'' while actually playing the violin riffs herself. At 2:30 that morning, judges balanced a tiara on her head and named Addams the best in the state.

At precisely the same time, Fisher and Glover were drinking beer in Fisher's room and listening to the soundtrack from ''Psycho.'' Glover picked up a bat and went to a hall where Winchell was sleeping on a cot.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Winchell never woke up. Glover swung the bat five or six times with such ferociousness that parts of Winchell's brain extruded through his left ear, according to testimony. Blood covered the walls and ceilings, splashing 15 feet down the hall.

Addams rushed home to call Winchell with her great news, but there was no answer. She would learn the devastating truth the next afternoon, from the television. To this day, she blames herself. ''The reason he was killed was because he was dating me,'' she says. ''That makes it even more devastating, to think that I had played some role in it.''

Among the first things Addams did was to develop the one roll of film with pictures of the two of them together. But the film had been ruined somehow, and the pictures were black, a final cruelty that she still despairs. She now has only a few photographs that Winchell gave her from his childhood; she wrapped up the rest and sent them back to his parents. She included a small picture of herself. It had already hit the papers that Winchell had been dating ''a drag queen'' from a Nashville club, and Addams hoped to prepare Winchell's parents for the sordid coverage. ''Just to settle your mind, this is me,'' she put in an accompanying note. ''I tried to be a good person, and I just hope that you can find it in your heart not to hate me.''

Winchell's mother, Patricia Kutteles, a psychiatric nurse from Kansas City, Mo., knew only that her son was dating a dancer from Nashville, which saddens her, given that in her liberal household homosexuality was discussed and accepted. Perhaps, she thinks, this indicates he was simply in a passing phase. ''When I found out Calpernia was a transsexual or whatever, that was a bit surprising,'' she says. ''But she is a very nice person, and she really cared about Barry. Knowing he was in a happy relationship, in the end, that helped. When we talked, he was just so optimistic about his future.''

Addams and Kutteles have spoken once, briefly, on the telephone. They had agreed to meet one afternoon during Glover's court-martial. (Glover got a life sentence; Fisher, who washed the blood from the bat, got 12 years in a plea bargain.) But Addams canceled. ''I just felt I did not have the strength to show myself to this woman,'' Addams explains. ''I don't want to make myself sound like Florence Nightingale, but if only one group of people gets to have the help and attention, then certainly I would have it be Barry's parents.''

At a fund-raising cocktail party for the S.L.D.N. in a 190-year-old historic Nashville farmhouse, Calpernia Addams is filling a plate with roasted pork loin and steamed shrimp dumplings. Earlier in the day, Addams was not sure she would attend the event. ''I only found out about it after a friend forwarded me e-mail,'' she said then. She feels strange, being so bitterly marginalized. But she is just now beginning to allow herself room to criticize.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

''I'm disappointed in a lot of ways with almost every organization that I thought would help me with this,'' she says. ''A lot of things I don't want to go in print -- speaking out against these major national gay and lesbian organizations -- but a lot of them I thought would come and help me or say something, or do a press release or give me some advice. And they just didn't.'' But ultimately she pulled on a skin-tight tongue-pink top and a slinky red skirt that reached below her knees, and with a mist of slight Southern conceit she strode right past the donation table and over to the food.

Across the room Kathi Westcott, the S.L.D.N. staff attorney, has begun calling everyone to attention, and she asks Addams to come forward. ''I am constantly amazed by her elegance and her calm and cool,'' Westcott announces. ''Without her strength and courage I don't think we would be able to convince the press that this was a hate crime.''

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

With that, Westcott hands Addams a framed commendation from the organization. ''We commend you for your courage in ensuring justice for P.F.C. Barry Winchell,'' it says. ''In addition your extraordinary efforts have helped force our Armed Forces to implement new rules in training to prevent anti-gay harassment and hate crimes, making the world safer for all.'' Addams is overcome with emotion. ''That's so nice,'' she says in a voice so soft it is barely above a lip-synch.

But there is something in the text that snags her, or rather something that is missing. There is no mention of her loss. Its author seems no more capable of picturing her as one-half of this couple than Addams herself was when gripping those blackened photographs. The proclamation is proof that Winchell belongs to them now, no longer to her at all. ''I do feel like I was an awkward element for everybody involved,'' Addams says several weeks later. She sounds a note of resignation. ''I didn't want to be anybody's anything, really, except Barry's girlfriend. And that was already taken away from me.''

Correction: July 2, 2000, Sunday Because of an editing error, an article on May 28 about Calpernia Addams, who is in the process of changing sexes to female from male, and the murder of her boyfriend, Pfc. Barry Winchell, included an erroneous statement about a meeting between Addams and Kathi Westcott, a lawyer, and Rhonda White, a gay rights advocate, after the murder. Westcott did not say that Addams, ''for the sake of clarity,'' should tell reporters to refer to her as a male.

Dana Cuffaro, 21, of East 52nd Street and her brother, Michael, of East 54th Street, were arrested in the attack along with Ian Blackstone, 18, of East 85th Street and Sean Lackaye, 18, of East 68th Street. All four were charged with assault and robbery, and the case was referred to the Police Department's hate crimes task force.

The police said the man was walking down East 10th Street when he encountered the four suspects, who shouted anti-gay slurs and then chased him when he tried to run away. The police said Dana Cuffaro confronted him, and that when he put out his arms to keep her away, three men chased the victim, took his bag, knocked him down, and punched and kicked him. He suffered minor injuries and was treated at Bellevue Hospital Center and released, the police said.

Leonard Levenson, a lawyer for the suspects, said the police report did not contain the full story. He said that the four had met the man in an East Village bar and had gotten into an argument during which the man had struck Ms. Cuffaro in the face. That angered her brother and led to the scuffle outside, he said.

Mr. Levenson described the suspects as honor students who had never been in trouble with the law before.",nytimes.com,True

Vice President Gore, addressing the group by videotape beamed on a huge screen above the Mall, declared, ''I stand with you, and am with you every step of the way'' in the march for civil rights.

Mr. Gore said he would not rest in the fight against AIDS and in the struggle to protect gay Americans from employment discrimination and to ensure that ''crimes of hate against all people, including gays and lesbians,'' are severely punished.

President Clinton, also speaking by videotape, said he had created the ''most inclusive'' administration in history, with more than 150 openly gay men and lesbians as appointees, and would ''continue our fight for an employment nondiscrimination act that would ban discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace.''

But there was more than electoral politics to the day; there was a broader, more festive tone. The marchers, who began to wind from the Washington Monument to the Capitol at 10:20 a.m., were a long, ebullient parade of cops and veterans, drag queens and college students, gay parents with toddlers on their backs and heterosexual parents marching in support of gay children.

Their signs and banners, some carefully designed and mass produced, some homemade, reflected the diversity: ''Proud Son of a Lesbian.'' ''Protect Our Families.'' ''Stop Hate Crimes.'' ''Ohio Gay Officers Action League.'' ''Gay Veterans of Chicago.'' ''Proud to be from Vermont.''

There were several variations on Vermont signs. The state, which recently passed a bill creating civil unions that give gay couples the rights of marriage, was praised and trumpeted throughout the day.

As the organizers hoped, there were many families here. Larry Leon was pushing his 22-month-old twins in a double-stroller with his partner, Marc Salans, and carrying a sign that demanded, ''Keep Gay Adoption Legal.'' Mr. Leon, who lives in Washington, said, ''We want to celebrate our family, celebrate the joy of having a family, celebrate the success of our adoption endeavor.''

Susan from North Carolina, who declined to give her last name, said she, her partner and their 17-month-old daughter were ''just marching for our family.''

Ms. Birch, of the Human Rights Campaign, described her and her partner's adoption of twins and told the crowd, ''Don't let anybody tell you that you're not worthy of parenthood.''

There were tiny clusters of protesters. As the march began, a man with a bullhorn shouted, ''Sick! Sick! Sick!'' The marchers chanted back, ''Shame! Shame! Shame!'' Another protester yelled: ''You're despicable before God. You know nothing about families.'' And a marcher shouted back, ''Jesus loves me.''

But by and large, the march had the air of a vast street festival, fed by the array of entertainers and celebrities, from Melissa Etheridge to Martina Navratilova, who took the stage at the foot of the Capitol. Anne Heche, the actress, declared from the stage, ''I gotta say I was straight for 27 years and I never came to a party as big as this.''

The march came under criticism from some gay activists, who argued that the planning was not inclusive enough, that the organizers had allowed too much commercialization with sponsors like United Airlines and Showtime Network and that the purpose of the march was ill-defined.

One critic, Bill Dobbs, with the Ad Hoc Committee for an Open Process, said today: ''Rather than unite and galvanize the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community, the march's organizers and the Human Rights Campaign have created divisions. That rift, about who speaks for the movement and how decisions are made, must be addressed before we can move forward.''

But Dianne Hardy-Garcia, executive director of the Millennium March on Washington, as today's rally was called, said that taking such a strong, visible stand for equality in an election year ''is smart -- and a judicious use of resources.''

Ms. Hardy-Garcia said the march was intended to show the generational and geographic range of the movement, its growing numbers of openly gay families and its ability to build coalitions. ''I think there was an image that we were only an urban gay community,'' she said.

One of those coalitions was demonstrated on the stage today, when the family of Matthew Shepard was joined by the family of James Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged to death behind a truck by three whites in Jasper, Tex.

Many of those here today said they hoped their presence would send a signal. When asked why she was here, a New York City police sergeant replied: ''Strength in numbers. Pride. For some people, it's a life-altering event.''

As detectives investigated the pattern of the slayings, worshipers arrived today for services at the Beth El Congregation of the South Hills. This is the synagogue where Mrs. Gordon was revered as a mainstay volunteer and where the police say Mr. Baumhammers shot out the front windows and painted red swastikas on the facade after killing her.

''People were crying, it was terrible,'' Barry Trilling, a lawyer, said outside the synagogue, describing the scene of mourning for Mrs. Gordon and the other victims. Mr. Trilling and other residents said the area had been a peaceful bedroom community proud of its reputation for tolerance.

''This man just went nuts,'' said Mr. Trilling.

''Like a madman,'' said Sue Trilling, his wife.

Mr. Baumhammers, whose parents emigrated from Latvia, was described by authorities as a lawyer who specialized in immigration and export-import cases. But Mr. Difenderfer said his client had been professionally idle in recent months and living with his parents while undergoing psychiatric care.

The carnage occurred over a two-hour period across two counties and four townships with witnesses later identifying Mr. Baumhammers as a gunman who was remarkably placid in approaching and leaving the shooting scenes.

The number of bias incidents against gay men and lesbians dropped to 75 in 1999 from 107 in 1998, a decrease of 30 percent, and the number of incidents in the first three months of this year was down compared with the same period last year, falling to 9 from 17, according to police statistics. The number of incidents last year was still higher than 1997, when the department recorded 59 bias crimes against gays.

''Crime in general is going down, why not bias, too?'' said Deputy Inspector Barbara Sicilia, who commands the police bias unit.

The New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project released a study Thursday that reported the number of bias incidents was down 19 percent, to 499 from 616. Last year's figure was the lowest number and sharpest decline since the group started tracking crimes in 1995.

''This case is about the erosion of the jury by the New Jersey Legislature,'' Mr. Apprendi's lawyer, Joseph D. O'Neill, told the court today. ''If a person is to be stigmatized as a racist, that should be found by the broadest cross section of the community, and that is the jury.''

The argument got a sympathetic response from justices across the court's ideological spectrum, from Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia among the conservatives to John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter among its more liberal members.

Justice Scalia said that under the Sixth Amendment's right to trial by jury, there was an ''unbroken tradition'' that it was the jury that had to find the facts that could increase the sentence. Justice Scalia grew so animated in picking up the slack in Mr. O'Neill's somewhat halting argument that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist teased him at one point for arguing the defendant's case.

Other justices, however, appeared troubled by the potential implications of finding the New Jersey system unconstitutional.

''What do you do with capital sentencing schemes?'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked Mr. O'Neill, noting that in some states it is the judge who decides, after a jury's finding of guilt, whether a convicted murderer will receive a death sentence. And Justice Stephen G. Breyer, an author of the federal sentencing guidelines when he worked in the Senate in the 1970's, told Mr. O'Neill: ''If I agree with you, I guess I'm holding the Sentencing Commission unconstitutional'' because judges, not juries, apply the various factors that determine a defendant's sentence.

The court has struggled in several recent cases over where to draw the constitutional line between the roles of judge and jury in laws that provide for longer sentences when, for example, the defendant has used a gun in the commission of a crime or has a criminal record. In its decision last June upholding Mr. Apprendi's sentence, the New Jersey Supreme Court acknowledged the ferment in this area of law and said that ''the final word on this subject will have to come from the United States Supreme Court.''

Lisa S. Gochman, a deputy attorney general from New Jersey who argued in defense of the law, emphasized the difference between ''intent'' and ''motive'' in criminal law. Whether a defendant had the requisite intent to commit the crime, essential to the finding of guilt, remained as it always has been, a question for the jury under New Jersey's approach, she said. But the question of motive, or why the defendant committed the crime, was traditionally treated as a sentencing factor, she said. For example, Ms. Gochman said, it had never been considered the prosecution's duty to prove why someone committed a burglary, whether to feed a drug habit or feed a family.

''But motive has never had the significance it has under the New Jersey statute,'' Justice Souter told the state's lawyer. ''New Jersey has chosen to give it a very different role,'' so the traditional treatment did not necessarily apply, he said.

Neither the federal hate-crime sentencing law, under which the jury makes the finding of biased purpose, nor the laws of most states will be affected by the decision in this case, Apprendi v. New Jersey, No. 99-478. But the Justice Department supported the state's side because of federal laws that provide for enhanced sentences in other contexts.

Justice Thomas offered a pointed response to the argument an assistant solicitor general, Edward C. DuMont, made on behalf of the law.

''You argue that if it's an element of the offense it goes to the jury and if it's a sentence enhancement it goes to the judge,'' he said. ''The difficulty I have is that you nowhere define what the distinction is.''

''Changes in the way guns are designed and manufactured, marketed and distributed could save many lives in the future,'' Mrs. Clinton said in an appearance at a Lower Manhattan office building yesterday with State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who is negotiating with the gun manufacturers.

Mr. Spitzer, along with representatives from San Francisco, New Orleans and other states and cities, has met several times since last summer with gun manufacturers, asking them to add trigger locks or other devices to guns they produce to prevent them from being fired accidentally, a spokesman for the attorney general said. And the attorney general has asked the manufacturers to stop distributing guns to dealers who have a history of selling to criminals, said Scott R. Brown, Mr. Spitzer's spokesman.

''There has been a lost opportunity because New York City has not joined in this effort,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''Probably the people in New York City have as much or more to gain from such a code of conduct and changes in the way that the gun manufacturers do business as any people anywhere in our country.''

Mrs. Clinton, a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in New York, did not mention her probable Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.

Sunny Mindel, Mr. Giuliani's press secretary, later rejected the criticism. ''If Mrs. Clinton lived in New York City, she would know that it is the corporation counsel that analyzes these issues'' and would decide whether the city should join in such an effort, she said.

Lorna B. Goodman, a spokeswoman for Michael D. Hess, the corporation counsel, said the city has not sued gun manufacturers because it is still trying to assess the likelihood of winning such a case.

And it succeeds to the extent that a three-act play lasting nearly three hours can mine deeper feelings than newspaper and television reporters who face daily deadlines. Mr. Kaufman even breaks a little news in the play, revealing that Reggie Fluty, the deputy sheriff who first reached Mr. Shepard at the fence, learned later that the victim was H.I.V. positive and feared that her efforts to resuscitate him had exposed her to the virus that causes AIDS. She began drug therapy, and tests showed she was not infected.

But in addressing larger issues attached to the murder of a gay man for no other reason than his sexual orientation, for which the roofers received life sentences with no chance of parole, the play reflects a community still in conflict: Romaine Patterson, a university student, says she was inspired to pursue courses in political science in order to fight for human rights, yet a Baptist minister, who goes unnamed in the play, says he hopes that during the 18 hours Mr. Shepard was tied to the fence, he had a moment to reflect on his lifestyle.

Mr. Galloway, 25, a senior at the university who still works at the Fireside, was one of several Laramie residents portrayed onstage who attended the opening performance. In an interview, he said the Shepard murder had changed some attitudes in Laramie, including those of friends of his who no longer use slurs to describe gay men.

It was never quite so clear how Laramie fared.

As Laramie tried to move on, most of the cameras left.

But a curious group of interrogators stayed behind, and out of what they learned over a year of visits, during which they tape-recorded interviews with 200 Laramie residents, Moises Kaufman has crafted his latest play. The artistic director of the Tectonic Theater Project in New York, Mr. Kaufman has created ''The Laramie Project,'' an attempt to unpeel the layers of a town to understand how ordinary people might be affected by extraordinary events.

The play, a production of the Denver Center Theater Company in association with Tectonic, was scheduled to open last night at the Ricketson Theater in the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. Denver is the closest big city to Laramie. The play is expected to run through April 1. Mr. Kaufman then hopes to move it to New York.

''When Matthew was beaten, it was a watershed moment,'' Mr. Kaufman said in a recent interview as he and his company transcribed and evaluated hundreds of hours of audio tapes.

''At these certain watershed moments,'' he went on, ''ideas float around in our culture, and an event like this becomes a lightning rod as the ideas come together, parallel subjects like gay issues, community issues, violence, class.

''As we do with most of our projects, we asked ourselves, can the theater play a part in the national dialogue of current events? Media does that differently with radio, television and newspapers. We want to know if there is room for the theater to add to that.''

Mr. Kaufman's last play, ''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' attempted to answer similar questions about similar issues in its own context, Victorian England, and did so with rousing success. Though there was no actual murder, Wilde's position and reputation (and ultimately his life) were casualties once he was found guilty of being a homosexual and sentenced to jail. Drawn from actual court documents, testimony and handwritten journals -- the only sources of the words uttered onstage -- the play opened to glowing reviews in 1997 and ran for more than 600 performances in New York before moving on to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto and London. It continues in many other cities here and abroad.

In ''The Laramie Project,'' the presentation is more personal, even though the play focuses less directly on the murder than on its impact on the town. The story unfolds onstage through the words of those interviewed by Mr. Kaufman's actors and writers, and also through the actors' responses as they recreate their interview sessions, sometimes playing both interviewer and interviewee, marking the difference with costume and accent changes.

Mr. Kaufman acknowledged a certain amount of artistic license, inasmuch as any creative endeavor involves some content selection and editing. But the audience is never duped. The play opens with a narrator conveying the important distinction that it is based on what the actors heard from their sources, not on what the sources said.

In some ways, the process resembles the work of Anna Deavere Smith, the author and performer who created two acclaimed plays after conducting hundreds of taped interviews -- to reflect ethnic strife in New York City in ''Fires in the Mirror'' and civil disturbances in California in ''Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992.'' Her current work, ''House Arrest,'' examines the role of the presidency through interviews and historical documents.

But there are important differences between her work and his, Mr. Kaufman said. While Ms. Smith alone decided how many of those interviewed would be given life onstage, the Tectonic project involved 11 actors and writers as interviewers, a collaboration that led to intense arguments and emotional pleas by company members, campaigning to have their subjects included in the final script. By the end, only about 60 made the cut, with Mr. Kaufman and his head writer, Leigh Fondakowski, choosing.

It was also unusual -- probably unique, Mr. Kaufman said -- that a theater company would spend so much time in one place researching, a commitment that made the actors themselves virtual residents of Laramie and, as a result, part of the story. Unlike hit-and-run television and many print reporters, they had the time to win trust and, in the end, become part of the story they tell.

'' 'The Laramie Project' actually explores the effect our presence had on the town and that the town had on us,'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''It underlines the importance of the observer and constantly reminds the audience that what they are hearing and seeing is an aesthetic experience created by a group of people who are trying to tell a story and paint a portrait of what we saw and heard.''

In other words, the play is not so much a documentary as theatrical journalism, an attempt to tell a true story in a way that would be more difficult in another medium.

For Mr. Kaufman, the shocking events in Laramie had a natural resonance, given his own crosscurrents as a playwright, director and man. Mr. Kaufman, 36, whose father is a Holocaust survivor from Romania, grew up Jewish and gay in a largely Roman Catholic country, Venezuela, where he attended an Orthodox Jewish school in which almost everyone else was studying business. Arriving in the United States in 1987 to study theater, he instantly became a ''Latino.''

THOSE personal anomalies, he said, fueled an initial fascination with what happened in Laramie, and that fascination grew as he and his actors gathered material from a wide assortment of townspeople. Some of these were directly involved in the case, like prosecutors, investigators, the bartender who served Mr. Shepard the night he was assaulted and the bicyclist; others were not, including friends and relatives of Mr. Shepard and friends and relatives of his killers, and some had no connection.

The actors also interviewed Mr. Shepard's parents, Judy and Dennis, for whom the case became a crusade for laws making a victim's sexual orientation a reason for designating a crime as a hate crime. But the Shepards are not represented in the play. Nor are the killers, Aaron J. McKinney and Russell A. Henderson, whom the actors did not seek to interview.

When they first arrived in Laramie, Mr. Kaufman and his inquisitive band had no idea what their efforts might produce, he said. Some were initially shy about seeking interviews. Some were uncomfortable with the tape recorders. Most had never conducted an interview of any kind. And some had rough early encounters: Mr. Kaufman said one of the actors told him that he approached a man ''who I thought was going to kick me in the stomach.''

But as his questioners fanned out, working in teams of two, themes began emerging over their six two-week visits to the town. ''We were hearing these incredible voices, incredible stories,'' said Ms. Fondakowski, a member of the Tectonic group since 1995. ''We found that people had felt so betrayed in that their town had been misrepresented as a Podunk, hillbilly, redneck kind of place. With us, they saw they had another opportunity to tell a version of their story.''

For Mr. Kaufman and all his collaborators -- including Donovan Marley, the artistic director of the Denver Center Theater Company -- the final script uses Laramie's story to tell a much larger one: that America, for all its fortunes and power, still cannot escape the basic human conflicts, and tragedies, arising out of differences learned through fear and ignorance.

''This is about what happens to a town when it is forced to really look at all the things people really believed in all their lives,'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''A lot of the philosophy we heard from people was that Laramie was a live-and-let-live place. But I don't know. I really don't know what the truth is in that statement.''",nytimes.com,True

*At the University of Connecticut this past fall, there were 24 acts of anti-gay harassment, attempted assault and vandalism, according to Martha Nelson, director of the Rainbow Center on campus, which provides education on issues concerning homosexuals, lesbians and bisexuals.

When arrests were made in the above incidents, they were made under the state's hate crime statute. In the nearly dozen years the state has kept track of such crimes, the annual totals have fluctuated. Eighty-two bias crimes were reported in 1989, the first year the police enforced the law, and a high of 143 hate crimes were reported in 1996, according to the state Department of Public Safety.

In 1998, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the police reported 115 hate crimes.

But many people who study these incidents consider the statistics unreliable because reporting hate crimes has varied widely from town to town. Just two years ago the State Legislature modified the law to require city and town police departments to report crimes of bias to the state police. Yet determining that a crime was motivated by bigotry sometimes takes investigation and interpretation that vary from town to town and from one police department to another, law enforcement officials said.

''Hate crime reporting has been extremely variable,'' said Robert Leikind, the director of the Connecticut office of the Anti-Defamation League. He said that from 1993 to 1994 he knew of 18 towns in which hate crimes occurred but none were reported.

Opinion is divided on whether the number and incidence of hate crimes here shows that Connecticut is more or less tolerant than other places. No one is saying that the state is pristine, but some experts say the state's national ranking is skewed. The F.B.I. gathers national statistics on hate crimes, and according to its numbers, Connecticut was ranked as having the 18th highest number of such crimes in the country out of 46 states and the District of Columbia. Not all states reported. Connecticut even ranked higher than Mississippi and Arkansas.

The nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks bias crimes, said there are 25 organized hate groups in Arkansas, including 10 different organized Ku Klux Klan groups, as opposed to two such groups in Connecticut. Yet Arkansas reported only three hate crimes for 1998, according to the F.B.I., when Connecticut reported more than 100. Why is there such a difference?

''The discrepancy lies in the number of agencies in each state which submitted hate crimes,'' said Paul E. Bresson, an F.B.I. spokesman. He pointed out that only two agencies in Arkansas submitted information to the agency, while 48 agencies in Connecticut sent the F.B.I. information on bias crimes.

''It's kind of unfortunate if a state gets beaten up for having agencies that provide more information than others,'' Mr. Bresson said. ''No state wants to hear that it had a high number of hate crimes. The fact that they are participating in itself shows that they are taking steps to address the issue.''

State Rep. Michael Lawlor, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said there were more tensions now in the state along racial lines than a few years ago. Those concerns led him and Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan to propose changes to the state's bias law recently that would make the statute more flexible and easier to prosecute and would contain a variety of sanctions. The biggest problem with the current law is that an act of bias must be directed against a specific individual to be prosecuted. The new proposal would change that, he said.

The current bias crimes law is classified as a class D felony, making intimidation based on bigotry punishable by up to five years in prison with a fine up to $5,000. The proposed law would increase penalties and add new classifications. For example, it would add an additional Class C felony to the crime for offenses that involve personal injury. This would make such a crime punishable by a maximum of 10 years with a fine of up to $10,000.

The proposal would also create a new, Class C misdemeanor hate crime in the third degree involving simple intent to intimidate, including making threats in any form, punishable by a maximum one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The proposal would also establish an education program for first-time offenders and includes money to train police officers on bias crimes.

Detective Sgt. Joann K. Peterson, who has worked in the New Haven Police Department's Bias Crimes Unit for five years, said that hate crimes were more frequently committed by young people aged 14 to 21, either in loosely organized groups or as individuals. ''This isn't something that's just done by the Ku Klux Klan,'' she said. ''It crosses all groups. It happens in cities, it happens in small towns.''

What is changing regarding crimes of bigotry, many observed, is perception and public reaction when the media puts incidents in the spotlight.

Concern about the November appearance of the Ku Klux Klan motivated the Rev. Paige Besse-Rankin of Woodmont United Church of Christ to start a racism task force in Milford. ''To be American is to have to struggle in some way with the issue of racism,'' she said. ''It's woven into the culture here. It's easy to say that because we're not out there in white sheets, we're not racist. We really need to get to a more sophisticated understanding of bigotry than that.''

Experiencing bigotry first-hand was a painful experience for Rabbi Howard Sommer. Vandals using white spray paint scrawled swastikas on Rabbi Sommer's synagogue, Temple Beth Tikvah in Madison last May. It was the first such incident in the 20 years he has presided over the congregation.

''There are key indicators of frustration in our society and hate crimes are one manifestation of that,'' he said.

But Rabbi Sommer was gratified, he said, by the community's outpouring of concern after the temple was defaced.

''People offered a reward. People sent letters. We had statements from boards of deacons. We had phone calls We had prayer, and people offered to come and repaint the synagogue. It does affirm that the power of goodness and life is the most powerful force that God has created in the world,'' he said.

Yet one synagogue found recent acts of anti-Semitism disturbing enough that officials there arranged for heightened security during some religious services.

''It is important we not be alarmist,'' said Rabbi Eric Polokoff, rabbi of B'nai Israel Woodbury/Southbury synagogue. ''In general, the level of tolerance in Connecticut is quite good. But we have seen a plethora of anti-Semitic incidents or acts of hatred in a very short period, he said.

Rabbi Polokoff arranged for security at the synagogue during the Jewish holy days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. He would not say what the security entailed. He stressed that his congregation had not been the target of anti-Semitic acts, but cited the killings at a Jewish center in Los Angeles and a bomb threat at the Jewish Community Center in Woodbridge as contributing factors in the decision.

''Not every community has to wrestle with this,'' he said. ''I asked a Christian colleague, 'Do you have more security at Christmas?' He was just incredulous, it never would have occurred to him. But for us, not to consider issues of security would be really irresponsible.''

In many ways, observers said, crimes of bias have different characteristics depending upon what group is targeted. For example, while most crimes of religious bias are aimed against Jews, more than 80 percent of crimes rooted in religious bigotry involve vandalism and destruction of property rather than attacks against people.

Ms. Nelson of the Rainbow Center said that crimes against homosexuals were underreported, because many gays who are harassed or assaulted are reluctant to admit their sexual orientation and don't go to police.

''Most of these incidents are peer-on-peer harassment involving younger people,'' she said. ''It makes me wonder what goes on in school.'' She also said that since the Rainbow Center opened last year, the increased visibility the center brought to homosexual issues made it a magnet for vandalism and other incidents. ''Some backlash is to be expected,'' she said. ''You can't grow up gay in this society and be unaware of the homophobia that permeates our society.''

Minority leaders said that bias crimes against blacks, which the F.B.I. said made up 40 percent of hate crimes nationwide, was but the most blatant example of racism in the United States.

''We live in a highly segregated state along racial and class lines,'' said Roger C. Vann, president of the Connecticut National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ''The kind of hate crimes we see publicized is the surface of the problem. Racism is a social disease that has infected our country. Very little has been done to eradicate this disease. Just like any illness that goes untreated, the worse it gets, the more difficult it is to treat.''

He said the state needed an honest dialogue about race and added that he was disappointed that the Sheff vs. O'Neill court decision regarding the need to integrate the state's public schools did not spark a more honest debate. ''The fear was palpable after the decision was announced,'' he said. ''All people said was, 'no busing, no busing.' The issue is who's on the bus, not where the bus is going. Because of the lack of open and honest dialogue, we never got to the prejudice lurking beneath that issue.''

He said that because of the racism so common in society, he was surprised there were not more hate crimes. ''They are going to happen,'' he said. ''You just hope that when incidents take place, people of conscience come together and be a voice against this activity.''

When it comes to law enforcement of bias crimes, state law enforcement officials said that the experts in the state worked for the New Haven Police Department. It is the only local law enforcement agency in the state that has a separate unit to investigate crimes of bias. The city also trains all its officers how to investigate such crimes. The city formed the special unit after the original hate crime legislation was passed in 1988.

''It hasn't been a priority for a lot of smaller departments,'' said Kay D. Codish, director of training and education for the New Haven Police Department.

She also said there were barriers that kept people from reporting incidents involving bigotry.

''People don't report hate crimes for many reasons,'' she said. ''They don't want to deal with the police.''

Sargent Peterson asked members of the community to meet with the bias crimes unit several months ago, inviting educators, ministers and activists to attend an open house. ''I know this is a difficult crime to report,'' she said. ''Maybe if people know us, they would be more likely to call us.''

''Sometimes you have to expose a problem before you can fix it,'' she said.

Editors' Note: February 13, 2000, Sunday An article on Page 1 of the Connecticut section today describes the persistence of hate crimes in the state. It cites an Aug. 17 incident in which medical-waste containers marked with swastikas were left in front of a Stamford synagogue, and says there have been no arrests in the case.

Officials said they thought the suspect, Alan J. Lorenz of Weston, was also responsible for a string of similar incidents in Stamford and Norwalk. Stephen C. Robinson, the United States attorney for Connecticut, said Mr. Lorenz was Jewish but offered no suggested motive for the crimes. Mr. Lorenz was charged in a federal indictment with a single civil rights crime that accuses him of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs solely in connection with an incident at Temple Beth El in Stamford on Aug. 17.",nytimes.com,True
